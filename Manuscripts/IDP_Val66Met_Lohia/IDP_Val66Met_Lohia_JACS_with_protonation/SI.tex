\subsubsection*{Selection of force field}
In order to get accurate structural characterization of proBDNF with MD,  we ran  500ns of T-REMD simulations of 30 residue fragment of V66 proBDNF with several commonly used ff and water model combinations. First 200ns of data was discarded as equilibration ~\ref{S1}a compares the CA shifts for  Amber99sb*-ildn-q ~\cite {Lindorff-Larsen2010a, Hornak2006a} with Tip4p-D ~\cite {Piana2015},  Amber99sbws ~\cite {Lindorff-Larsen2010a, Best2014} Amberff03sbws  ~\cite {Best2009, Best2014}, Amber99sb-ildn with Tip3P ~\cite {Jorgensen1981} and NMR.  Amber99sb-ildn with Tip4p-D and Amber99sbws gives good agreement with NMR CA chemical shift.  We also compared Rg distribution for the tested ff (~\ref{S1}b).  Tip3P generates very collapsed ensembles and the remaining three ff generates similar Rg distribution. Tip3P is known to produce structures which are too collapsed relative to experiment. ~\cite {Piana2015, Best2014, Mercadante2015} Since, the remaining three ff gives comparable Rg, we proceed with Amber99sb*-ildn-q with Tip4p-D because it gives the best match with experiments. It has also been observed that for IDP's with little or no secondary structure,  Amber99sb*-ildn-q with Tip4p-D showed good agreement with experimental NMR measurements. ~\cite {Robustelli2018}.

\subsubsection*{Simulation convergence}
Most previous IDP simulations studies have been performed on smaller IDP fragments (residues 3-42) ~\cite{Henriques, Rauscher2017, Meng2018} . We performed the explicit solvent replica simulations of 91 residues, which was computationally challenging and thus we carefully accessed the convergence of our simulations. All replicas were able to diffuse in the temperature range 300K to 385K (replica round trip number \textgreater 7) (~\ref{S13}b). The Rg for V66 and M66 converge after 800ns of simulation at 300K (~\ref{S1}b). We discarded the first 800 ns of the trajectories as conformational equilibration.


Although there are some localized discrepancies for certain residue types (Y34,L59,M95,Y113), the discrepancy is conserved across all four simulations (FigS2). Thus, these specific discrepancies are probably reflecting residual force-field inaccuracies, including the cation-pi interactions that are poorly captured by non-polarizable force felid.

\subsubsection*{Tertiary contacts network} The contact networks were build using Cytoscape ~\cite {Ahlstrom2013} with linear representation of residues.  Each protein residue comprises a node in the network, with interactions between residues represented as edges. The strength of individual interactions can be interpreted by the  thickness of the edge line on the network diagram. The transparency of an edge increases as it is found at more temperatures.  If residue  66 or its neighboring residues (A51-P79) are involved in h-bond formation, its edge is drawn above the node; otherwise, the edge is drawn at the bottom of the node. To focus on significant interactions, interactions showing more than 3\% persistence were considered in network visualization.      

\subsection*{Analysis of MD Trajectories} For MD simulations, the secondary structure content was  calculated with the STRIDE program incorporated in VMD,\cite{Humphrey1996}  which takes into account the combination of backbone dihedral angles and hydrogen bonding. Helix includes $\alpha$-helix and 3\textsubscript{10}-helix and $\beta$ includes $\beta$-strand and $\beta$-bridge. The hydrogen bonds were calculated with \textbar  D-A\textbar  distance \textless = .35 nm and angle D-H-A angle \textless= 40?. For salt bridges, distance \textless = .32 nm was used as cutoff between the anionic and cationic atom. The radius of gyration was calculated using the all atoms.

\subsubsection*{Hydrodynamic radius calculation} 



%\subsubsection{Finer resolution: Effect of Val66Met on *which* residues are doing the interaction}

%Several specific contacts are shown that are found in a significant number of frames for either V66 or M66, but not in the other one.   
%We observe few long-range contacts with significant differences in V66 and M66 with p  \textless  0.0001. \grace {The cross-over N is \~15 frames ?} .  We find that the differences we observe in long-range contacts are strongly correlated with contacts at residue 66,67 (i) and (i-3).
%
%Conventional contact maps provided little useful insight into tertiary structure for either forms of the protein, which was consistent with the intrinsic disorder and frequent transient interactions among neutral side-chains. Identification of contact residues yielded several persistent, weak long-range interactions at 300K for both sequences, which can be represented along a single axis (Fig~\ref{fig4}). 
%

%The prodomain has several well defined regions forming long-range tertiary contacts. \grace{We need to settle on one of two options : 1) defining the sticky domains according to hydrophobicity and showing that the tertiary contacts follow or 2) defining the domains from tertiary contacts and showing that they happen to be hydrophobic.}  All the four regions identified has high density of hydrophobic residues (Fig~\ref{fig1}c). It has been frequently observed that unfolded proteins form strong hydrophobic contacts ~\cite {Dobson1998}. Thus, it's not very surprising that the disordered prodomain has the presence of persistent hydrophobic contacts. \grace{Not sure about the previous - hydrophobicity is important for aggregation in general, within and among folded and misfolded proteins, it's just not very specific.  I'd like to change this remark but let's chat about it} Charges in the hydrophobic regions seem to determine the strength of contact formed between two hydrophobic regions.  x2 region, which is negatively charged forms contact with positively charged x3 region or neutral x1 region. Compact states of IDP's due to hydrophobic interactions have been observed in the past as well ~\cite {Chebaro2015, Kizilsavas2017}.

%Increased helix formation in M66 is contributed by two factors. 
%a) Reduced entropic cost of helix formation in M66 when compared with V66. Creamer et. al. ranked the entropic cost of helix formation for apolar side chains using simulations of a (Ala)\textsubscript{8} sequence with the 'guest' amino acid at the center and reported higher entropic cost helix formation for Valine when compared with Methionine \cite{Creamer1992}. 
%
%b) Helix stabilization in M66 by preferential contact formed between M66:F63. We looked at the weight of the contact formed at every residue pair separated with two residues (Fig~\ref{fig5}). Either two hydrophobic residues (L43:V46, A60:F63,A87:Y90 ) or  two residues with opposite charge (E73:K76), commonly form strong contacts (\textgreater 65\%) for both V66 and M66. Additionally, M66 forms strong contact at residue M66:F63, whereas V66 forms strong contact at residue I67:L70. A previous study from Faure et al ~\cite {Faure2008} analyzed the frequency of two amino acids contact within 1230 protein chains from Protein DataBank (PDB) and found that Methionine (M) has also a strong affinity with Phenylalanine (F) and itself.
%

%
%We also look at the temperature dependence of helical structure in prodomain. At 385K, the helix at residue 66 increases (\textgreater 2\%) for all V66, M66, V66\textsuperscript{65+}, but M66\textsuperscript{65+} has strongest preference (\textgreater 5\%) (Fig~\ref{fig4}c). Thus,  increased hydrophobic interaction with temperature (F63:M66) along with reduced electrostatic repulsion (H65:E69) in M66\textsuperscript{65+} favors helix formation.

%\subsubsection{How does Val66Met changes long range pairing}
%
%We observe few long-range contacts with significant differences in V66 and M66 with p  \textless  0.0001. \grace {The cross-over N is \~15 frames ?} . We find that the differences we observe in long-range contacts are strongly correlated with concats at residue 66,67 (i) and (i-3).

%\subsubsection{M66 supports helix formation at residue 93}
%
%We next examined the increased helix tendency at residue 93 from Val66Met substitution. We find structures forming helix at 93 are in contact with residue 66 in at-least 25\% of it's population in M66\textsuperscript{65+} (Fig~\ref{fig6}). The gain of this residue specific interaction in M66, probably increases helix formation at 93 when compared with V66.

%\textbf{Only Val66 and not Met66 forms long beta sheet structures at residue 66 and 93.} We next examined the backbone contacts formed between residues.
%% Hip65 reduces beta sheet tendency at residue 66 for both V and M form (Fig~\ref{fig5}a). This could be due to gain of helix at 66 in Hip65 form or due to loss of sheet structures which involved salt-bridge formation at 64. 
%V66 and M66 forms differential backbone contact at residue 66 (Fig~\ref{fig5}a). V66 forms beta sheet structures with residue 92. This is also consistent with NMR observation ~\cite{Anastasia2013}  , where Val66Met changes CS at residue 93 (Fig~\ref{fig8}a) . 
%We further test if the beta sheet structures at residue 66-95 in V66 is more favored in V66 than in M66 and is not a limitation of simulation convergence. To verify this observation, we performed simulations with backbone restraints of 1Kj/mole/nm2 of a V66 frame having beta sheet structures at residue 66-95 with Val66 mutated to Met. We find that M66 has higher loss in entropy at 93 (Fig~\ref{fig5}b). Additionally, 66-92 beta structures forms 64-93 salt bridge simultaneously in V66(Fig~\ref{fig5}c). In our restrained simulations M66 has 50\% less probability of forming salt-bridge at residue 64-93 (Fig~\ref{fig5}d). This result suggests that beta at 66-95 is less favored in M66 due to higher entropic and energetic cost.
