abstract = {Effective data reduction methods are necessary for uncovering the inherent conformational relationships present in large molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. Clustering algorithms provide a means to interpret the conformational sampling of molecules during simulation by grouping trajectory snapshots into a few subgroups, or clusters, but the relationships between the individual clusters may not be readily understood. Here we show that network analysis can be used to visualize the dominant conformational states explored during simulation as well as the connectivity between them, providing a more coherent description of conformational space than traditional clustering techniques alone. We compare the results of network visualization against 11 clustering algorithms and principal component conformer plots. Several MD simulations of proteins undergoing different conformational changes demonstrate the effectiveness of networks in reaching functional conclusions.},

This reformulation allows a natural extension of the method to potentials of the form 1/rp with p≥1. Furthermore, efficient calculation of the virial tensor follows. Use of B‐splines in place of Lagrange interpolation leads to analytic gradients as well as a significant improvement in the accuracy. We demonstrate that arbitrary accuracy can be achieved, independent of system size N, at a cost that scales as N log(N). For biomolecular systems with many thousands of atoms this method permits the use of Ewald summation at a computational cost comparable to that of a simple truncation method of 10 {\AA} or less.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional structures of proteins are the support of their biological functions. Their folds are stabilized by contacts between residues. Inner protein contacts are generally described through direct atomic contacts, i.e. interactions between side-chain atoms, while contact prediction methods mainly used inter-C$\alpha$ distances. In this paper, we have analyzed the protein contacts on a recent high quality non-redundant databank using different criteria. First, we have studied the average number of contacts depending on the distance threshold to define a contact. Preferential contacts between types of amino acids have been highlighted. Detailed analyses have been done concerning the proximity of contacts in the sequence, the size of the proteins and fold classes. The strongest differences have been extracted, highlighting important residues. Then, we studied the influence of five different side-chain conformation prediction methods (SCWRL, IRECS, SCAP, SCATD and SCCOMP) on the distribution of contacts. The prediction rates of these different methods are quite similar. However, using a distance criterion between side chains, the results are quite different, e.g. SCAP predicts 50{\%} more contacts than observed, unlike other methods that predict fewer contacts than observed. Contacts deduced are quite distinct from one method to another with at most 75{\%} contacts in common. Moreover, distributions of amino acid preferential contacts present unexpected behaviours distinct from previously observed in the X-ray structures, especially at the surface of proteins. For instance, the interactions involving Tryptophan greatly decrease.},

After a decade of extensive use and testing, limitations in this force field, such as over-stabilization of alpha-helices, were reported by us and other researchers. This led to a number of attempts to improve these parameters, resulting in a variety of "Amber" force fields and significant difficulty in determining which should be used for a particular application. We show that several of these continue to suffer from inadequate balance between different secondary structure elements. In addition, the approach used in most of these studies neglected to account for the existence in Amber of two sets of backbone phi/psi dihedral terms. This led to parameter sets that provide unreasonable conformational preferences for glycine. We report here an effort to improve the phi/psi dihedral terms in the ff99 energy function. Dihedral term parameters are based on fitting the energies of multiple conformations of glycine and alanine tetrapeptides from high level ab initio quantum mechanical calculations. The new parameters for backbone dihedrals replace those in the existing ff99 force field. This parameter set, which we denote ff99SB, achieves a better balance of secondary structure elements as judged by improved distribution of backbone dihedrals for glycine and alanine with respect to PDB survey data. It also accomplishes improved agreement with published experimental data for conformational preferences of short alanine peptides and better accord with experimental NMR relaxation data of test protein systems.},

Chem. Theory Comput. 2015, 11, 3420−3431], using the recently developed TIP4P-D water model. When used in conjunction with the standard AMBER ff99SB-ILDN force field and applied to the simulation of Histatin 5, our IDP model, we obtain results which are in excellent agreement with the best performing IDP-suitable force field from the earlier study and with experiment. We then assess the representativeness of the IDP models used in these and similar studies, finding that most are too short in comparison to the average IDP and contain a bias toward hydrophilic amino acid residues. Moreover, several key order-and disorder-promoting residues are also found to be misrepresented. It seems appropriate for future studies to address these issues. 1. INTRODUCTION Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to study the structural and dynamical properties of proteins for decades. Protein force field development is a very active research area, but until recently most protein force fields were developed almost exclusively for the simulation of folded proteins. Notwithstanding, with the sudden rise of scientific interest in intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and the realization that many of these proteins were quite challenging to study experimentally, many researchers turned their attention toward atomistic MD simulations, despite the lack of comprehensive literature on the appropriateness of these so-called " standard " force fields for the simulation of " nonstandard " unfolded states and IDPs. While it is now becoming widely accepted that many popular MD force fields are not well suited for the simulation of unfolded and intrinsically disordered proteins, 1−8 further combined computational and experimental studies of IDPs of different length and sequence composition are needed in order to delineate the accuracy and robustness of existing standard and new generation force fields and water models. In a previous publication (see ref 5), we have shown that several state-of-the-art, unmodified AMBER and GROMOS force fields systematically fail to reproduce small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) evidence for our model IDP, Histatin 5. However, when using the new AMBER ff03WS, 2 purposely developed for the simulation of IDPs -by slightly increasing the protein−water (dispersion) interactions -we attain excellent agreement between simulation and experiment.

abstract = {The largest force disfavoring the folding of a protein is the loss of conformational entropy. A large contribution to this entropy loss is due to the side-chains, which are restricted, although not immobilized, in the folded protein. In order to accurately estimate the loss of side-chain conformational entropy that occurs upon folding it is necessary to have accurate estimates of the amount of entropy possessed by side-chains in the ensemble of unfolded states. A new scale of side-chain conformational entropies is presented here. This scale was derived from Monte Carlo computer simulations of small peptide models. It is demonstrated that the entropies are independent of host peptide length. This new scale has the advantage over previous scales of being more precise with low standard errors. Better estimates are obtained for long (e.g., Arg and Lys) and rare (e.g., Trp and Met) side-chains. Excellent agreement with previous side-chain entropy scales is achieved, indicating that further advancements in accuracy are likely to be small at best. Strikingly, longer side-chains are found to possess a smaller fraction of the theoretical maximum entropy available than short side-chains. This indicates that rotations about torsions after chi(2) are significantly affected by side-chain interactions with the polypeptide backbone. This finding invalidates previous assumptions about side-chain-backbone interactions. Proteins 2000;40:443-450.},

However, dysfunctions in tau can lead to tau oligomerization, fibril formation, and neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer's disease. Using a combination of simulations and experiments, we explore the role of osmolytes in regulating the conformation and aggregation propensities of the R2/wt peptide, a fragment of tau containing the aggregating paired helical filament (PHF6*). We show that the osmolytes urea and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) shift the population of IDP monomer structures, but that no new conformational ensembles emerge. Although urea halts aggregation, TMAO promotes the formation of compact oligomers (including helical oligomers) through a newly proposed mechanism of redistribution of water around the perimeter of the peptide. We put forth a "superposition of ensembles" hypothesis to rationalize the mechanism by which IDP structure and aggregation is regulated in the cell.},

abstract = {The effects of disease mutations on protein structure and function have been extensively investigated, and many predictors of the functional impact of single amino acid substitutions are publicly available. The majority of these predictors are based on protein structure and evolutionary conservation, following the assumption that disease mutations predominantly affect folded and conserved protein regions. However, the prevalence of the intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and regions (IDRs) in the human proteome together with their lack of fixed structure and low sequence conservation raise a question about the impact of disease mutations in IDRs. Here, we investigate annotated missense disease mutations and show that 21.7{\%} of them are located within such intrinsically disordered regions. We further demonstrate that 20{\%} of disease mutations in IDRs cause local disorder-to-order transitions, which represents a 1.7-2.7 fold increase compared to annotated polymorphisms and neutral evolutionary substitutions, respectively. Secondary structure predictions show elevated rates of transition from helices and strands into loops and vice versa in the disease mutations dataset. Disease disorder-to-order mutations also influence predicted molecular recognition features (MoRFs) more often than the control mutations. The repertoire of disorder-to-order transition mutations is limited, with five most frequent mutations (R→W, R→C, E→K, R→H, R→Q) collectively accounting for 44{\%} of all deleterious disorder-to-order transitions. As a proof of concept, we performed accelerated molecular dynamics simulations on a deleterious disorder-to-order transition mutation of tumor protein p63 and, in agreement with our predictions, observed an increased $\alpha$-helical propensity of the region harboring the mutation. Our findings highlight the importance of mutations in IDRs and refine the traditional structure-centric view of disease mutations. The results of this study offer a new perspective on the role of mutations in disease, with implications for improving predictors of the functional impact of missense mutations.},

abstract = {Many proteins can be partially or completely disordered under physiological conditions. Structural charac-terization of these disordered states using experimental methods can be challenging, since they are composed of a structurally heterogeneous ensemble of conformations rather than a single dominant conformation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations should in principle provide an ideal tool for elucidating the composition and behavior of disordered states at an atomic level of detail. Unfortunately, MD simulations using current physics-based models tend to produce disordered-state ensembles that are structurally too compact relative to experiments. We find that the water models typically used in MD simulations significantly underestimate London dispersion interactions, and speculate that this may be a possible reason for these erroneous results. To test this hypothesis, we create a new water model, TIP4P-D, that approximately corrects for these deficiencies in modeling water dispersion interactions while maintaining compatibility with existing physics-based models. We show that simulations of solvated proteins using this new water model typically result in disordered states that are substantially more expanded and in better agreement with experiment. These results represent a significant step toward extending the range of applicability of MD simulations to include the study of (partially or fully) disordered protein states.},

abstract = {In eukaryotic cells, diverse stresses trigger coalescence of RNA-binding proteins into stress granules. In vitro, stress-granule-associated proteins can demix to form liquids, hydrogels, and other assemblies lacking fixed stoichiometry. Observing these phenomena has generally required conditions far removed from physiological stresses. We show that poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1 in yeast), a defining marker of stress granules, phase separates and forms hydrogels in vitro upon exposure to physiological stress conditions. Other RNA-binding proteins depend upon low-complexity regions (LCRs) or RNA for phase separation, whereas Pab1's LCR is not required for demixing, and RNA inhibits it.

abstract = {The small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are a virtually ubiquitous and diverse group of molecular chaperones that can bind and protect unfolding proteins from irreversible aggregation. It has been suggested that intrinsic disorder of the N-terminal arm (NTA) of sHSPs is important for substrate recognition. To investigate conformations of the NTA that could recognize substrates we performed replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations. Behavior at normal and stress temperatures of the dimeric building blocks of dodecameric HSPs from wheat (Ta16.9) and pea (Ps18.1) were compared because they display high sequence similarity, but Ps18.1 is more efficient in binding specific substrates. In our simulations, the NTAs of the dimer are flexible and dynamic; however, rather than exhibiting highly extended conformations they retain considerable $\alpha$-helical character and contacts with the conserved $\alpha$-crystallin domain (ACD). Network analysis and clustering methods reveal that there are two major conformational forms designated either "open" or "closed" based on the relative position of the two NTAs and their hydrophobic solvent accessible surface area. The equilibrium constant for the closed to open transition is significantly different for Ta16.9 and Ps18.1, with the latter showing more open conformations at elevated temperature correlated with its more effective chaperone activity. In addition, the Ps18.1 NTAs have more hydrophobic solvent accessible surface than those of Ta16.9. NTA hydrophobic patches are comparable in size to the area buried in many protein-protein interactions, which would enable sHSPs to bind early unfolding intermediates. Reduced interactions of the Ps18.1 NTAs with each other and with the ACD contribute to the differences in dynamics and hydrophobic surface area of the two sHSPs. These data support a major role for the conformational equilibrium of the NTA in substrate binding and indicate features of the NTA that contribute to sHSP chaperone efficiency.},

abstract = {A parallel message-passing implementation of a molecular dynamics (MD) program that is useful for bio(macro)molecules in aqueous environment is described. The software has been developed for a custom-designed 32-processor ring GROMACS (GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulation) with communication to and from left and right neighbours, but can run on any parallel system onto which a a ring of processors can be mapped and which supports PVM-like block send and receive calls. The GROMACS software consists of a preprocessor, a parallel MD and energy minimization program that can use an arbitrary number of processors (including one), an optional monitor, and several analysis tools. The programs are written in ANSI C and available by ftp (information: gromacs@chem.rug.nl). The functionality is based on the GROMOS (GROningen MOlecular Simulation) package (van Gunsteren and Berendsen, 1987; BIOMOS B.V., Nijenborgh 4, 9747 AG Groningen). Conversion programs between GROMOS and GROMACS formats are included. The MD program can handle rectangular periodic boundary conditions with temperature and pressure scaling. The interactions that can be handled without modification are variable non-bonded pair interactions with Coulomb and Lennard-Jones or Buckingham potentials, using a twin-range cut-off based on charge groups, and fixed bonded interactions of either harmonic or constraint type for bonds and bond angles and either periodic or cosine power series interactions for dihedral angles. Special forces can be added to groups of particles (for non-equilibrium dynamics or for position restraining) or between particles (for distance restraints). The parallelism is based on particle decomposition. Interprocessor communication is largely limited to position and force distribution over the ring once per time step. ?? 1995.},

The program TALOS establishes an empirical relation between 13C, 15N and 1H chemical shifts and backbone torsion angles phi and psi (Cornilescu et al. J Biomol NMR 13 289-302, 1999). Extension of the original 20-protein database to 200 proteins increased the fraction of residues for which backbone angles could be predicted from 65 to 74{\%}, while reducing the error rate from 3 to 2.5{\%}. Addition of a two-layer neural network filter to the database fragment selection process forms the basis for a new program, TALOS+, which further enhances the prediction rate to 88.5{\%}, without increasing the error rate. Excluding the 2.5{\%} of residues for which TALOS+ makes predictions that strongly differ from those observed in the crystalline state, the accuracy of predicted phi and psi angles, equals +/-13 degrees . Large discrepancies between predictions and crystal structures are primarily limited to loop regions, and for the few cases where multiple X-ray structures are available such residues are often found in different states in the different structures. The TALOS+ output includes predictions for individual residues with missing chemical shifts, and the neural network component of the program also predicts secondary structure with good accuracy.},

abstract = {The interactions of Met and Cys with other amino acid side chains have received little attention, in contrast to aromatic-aromatic, aromatic-aliphatic or/and aliphatic-aliphatic interactions. Precisely, these are the only amino acids that contain a sulfur atom, which is highly polarizable and, thus, likely to participate in strong Van der Waals interactions. Analysis of the interactions present in membrane protein crystal structures, together with the characterization of their strength in small-molecule model systems at the ab-initio level, predicts that Met-Met interactions are stronger than Met-Cys ≈ Met-Phe ≈ Cys-Phe interactions, stronger than Phe-Phe ≈ Phe-Leu interactions, stronger than the Met-Leu interaction, and stronger than Leu-Leu ≈ Cys-Leu interactions. These results show that sulfur-containing amino acids form stronger interactions than aromatic or aliphatic amino acids. Thus, these amino acids may provide additional driving forces for maintaining the 3D structure of membrane proteins and may provide functional specificity.},

Recent studies have focused on using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data as input for improved prediction. Here we examine the accuracy of chemical shift prediction for intein systems, which have regions of intrinsic disorder. We find that using MD simulation data as input for chemical shift prediction does not consistently improve prediction accuracy over use of a static X-ray crystal structure. This appears to result from the complex conformational ensemble of the disordered protein segments. We show that using accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD) simulations improves chemical shift prediction, suggesting that methods which better sample the conformational ensemble like aMD are more appropriate tools for use in chemical shift prediction for proteins with disordered regions. Moreover, our study suggests that data accurately reflecting protein dynamics must be used as input for chemical shift prediction in order to correctly predict chemical shifts in systems with disorder.},

Five out of six SorCS2 domains directly contribute to dimer formation and a C-terminal membrane proximal unreported domain, with an RNA recognition motif fold, locks the dimer in an intermolecular head-to-tail interaction. The complex structure shows an altered SorCS2 conformation indicating substantial structural plasticity. Both NGF dimer chains interact exclusively with the top face of a SorCS2 $\beta$-propeller. Biophysical experiments reveal that NGF, proNGF, and proBDNF bind at this site on SorCS2.

abstract = {The developmental increase in the strength of inhibitory synaptic circuits defines the time window of the critical period for plasticity in sensory cortices. Conceptually, plasticity of inhibitory synapses is an attractive mechanism to allow for homeostatic adaptation to the sensory environment. However, a brief duration of visual deprivation that causes maximal change in excitatory synapses produces minimal change in inhibitory synaptic transmission. Here we examined developmental and experience-dependent changes in inhibition by measuring miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of mouse visual cortex. During development from postnatal day 21 (P21) to P35, GABAA receptor function changed from fewer higher-conductance channels to more numerous lower-conductance channels without altering the average mIPSC amplitude. Although a week of visual deprivation did not alter the average mIPSC amplitude, a subsequent 2 h exposure to light produced a rapid rebound potentiation. This form of plasticity is restricted to a critical period before the developmental change in GABAergic synaptic properties is completed, and hence is absent by P35. Visual experience-dependent rebound potentiation of mIPSCs is accompanied by an increase in the open channel number and requires activity-dependent transcription of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Mice lacking BDNF transcription through promoter IV did not show developmental changes in inhibition and lacked rebound potentiation. Our results suggest that sensory experience may have distinct functional consequences in normal versus deprived sensory cortices, and that experience-dependent BDNF expression controls the plasticity of inhibitory synaptic transmission particularly when recovering vision during the critical period.},

M. Science 250, 669-673]. Here, we explore the hypothesis that these measured helix-forming propensities are due primarily to conformational restrictions imposed upon residue side chains by the helix itself. This proposition is tested by calculating the extent to which the bulky helix backbone "freezes out" available degrees of free-dom in helix side chains. Specifically, for a series of apolar residues, the difference in configurational entropy, AS, be-tween each side chain in the unfolded state and in the a-helical state is obtained from a simple Monte Carlo calculation. These computed entropy differences are then compared with the experimentally determined values. Measured and calculated values are found to be in close agreement for naturally occur-ring amino acids and in total disagreement for non-natural amino acids. In the calculation, ASAIa = 0. The rank order of entropy loss for the series of natural apolar side chains under consideration is Ala {\textless} Leu {\textless} Trp {\textless} Met {\textless} Phe {\textless} Ile {\textless} Tyr {\textless} Val. Among these, none favor helix formation; Ala is neutral, and all remaining residues are unfavorable to varying degrees. Thus, applied to side chains, the term "helix prefer-ence" is a misnomer. While side chain-side chain interactions may modulate stability in some instances, our results indicate that the drive to form helices must originate in the backbone, consistent with Pauling's view of four decades ago [Pauling, L., Corey, R.

We used all-atom molecular dynamics simulations at microsecond time scales with the OPLS-AA force field and TIP4P explicit water model to study the structural dynamics of the monomer and dimer of H6R sequences of both peptides. The reason behind the self-assembly acceleration is common that upon mutation the net charge is reduced leading to the weaker repulsive interaction between chains that facilitates the peptide association.

The limiting rate constants of reactive center loop insertion (k(lim)) and concentrations of proteinase at half-saturation (K(0.5)) for tPA and uPA and the specificity constants (k(lim)/K(0.5)) for elastase were determined. The pH dependences of k(lim)/K(0.5) reflected inactivation of each enzyme due to protonation of His57 of the catalytic triad. However, the specificity of the inhibitory reaction with tPA and uPA was notably higher than that for the substrate reaction catalyzed by elastase. pH dependences of k(lim) and K(0.5) obtained for tPA revealed an additional ionizable group (pKa, 6.0-6.2) affecting the reaction. Protonation of this group resulted in a significant increase in both k(lim) and K(0.5) and a 4.6-fold decrease in the specificity of the reaction of tPA with NBD P9 PAI-1. Binding of monoclonal antibody MA-55F4C12 to PAI-1 induced a decrease in k(lim) and K(0.5) at any pH but did not affect either the pKa of the group or an observed decrease in k(lim)/K(0.5) due to protonation of the group. In contrast to tPA, the k(lim) and K(0.5) for the reactions of uPA with NBD P9 PAI-1 or its complex with the monoclonal antibody were independent of pH in the 6.5-8.5 range. Since slightly acidic pH is a feature of a number of malignant tumors, alterations in PAI-1/tPA kinetics could play a role in the cancerogenesis. Changes in the protonation state of His(188), which is placed closely to the S1 site and is unique for tPA, has been proposed to contribute to the observed pH dependences of k(lim) and K(0.5).},

abstract = {An increasing number of studies using molec-ular dynamics (MD) simulations of unfolded and intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) suggest that current force fields sample conformations that are overly collapsed. Here, we study the applicability of several state-of-the-art MD force fields, of the AMBER and GROMOS variety, for the simulation of Histatin 5, a short (24 residues) cationic salivary IDP with antimicrobial and antifungal properties. The quality of the simulations is assessed in three complementary analyses: (i) protein shape and size comparison with recent experimental small-angle X-ray scattering data; (ii) secondary structure prediction; (iii) energy landscape exploration and conformational class analysis. Our results show that, indeed, standard force fields sample conformations that are too compact, being systematically unable to reproduce experimental evidence such as the scattering function, the shape of the protein as compared with the Kratky plot, and intrapeptide distances obtained through the pair distance distribution function, p(r). The consistency of this deviation suggests that the problem is not mainly due to protein− protein or water−water interactions, whose parametrization varies the most between force fields and water models. In fact, as originally proposed in [Best et al. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2014, 10, 5113−5124.], balanced protein−water interactions may be the key to solving this problem. Our simulations using this approach produce results in very good agreement with experiment.},

abstract = {Monomers of amyloid-b (Ab) protein are known to be disordered, but there is considerable controversy over the existence of residual or transient conformations that can potentially promote oligomerization and fibril formation. We employed single-molecule F{\"{o}} rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) spectroscopy with site-specific dye labeling using an unnatural amino acid and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate conformations and dynamics of Ab isoforms with 40 (Ab40) and 42 residues (Ab42). The FRET efficiency distributions of both proteins measured in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature show a single peak with very similar FRET efficiencies, indicating there is apparently only one state. 2D FRET efficiency donor lifetime analysis reveals, however, that there is a broad distribution of rapidly interconverting conformations. Using nanosecond fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, we measured the timescale of the fluctuations between these con-formations to be {\$}35 ns, similar to that of disordered proteins. These results suggest that both Ab40 and Ab42 populate an ensemble of rapidly reconfiguring unfolded states, with no long-lived conformational state distinguishable from that of the disordered ensemble. To gain molecular-level insights into these observations, we performed molecular dynamics simulations with a force field optimized to describe disordered proteins. We find, as in experiments, that both peptides populate configurations consistent with random polymer chains, with the vast majority of conformations lacking significant secondary structure, giving rise to very similar ensemble-averaged FRET efficiencies.},

The parametrization has been based on a fit of the temperature of maximum density (indirectly estimated from the melting point of hexagonal ice), the stability of several ice polymorphs and other commonly used target quantities. The calculated properties include a variety of thermodynamic properties of the liquid and solid phases, the phase diagram involving condensed phases, properties at melting and vaporization, dielectric constant, pair distribution function, and self-diffusion coefficient. These properties cover a temperature range from 123 to 573 K and pressures up to 40,000 bar. The model gives an impressive performance for this variety of properties and thermodynamic conditions. For example, it gives excellent predictions for the densities at 1 bar with a maximum density at 278 K and an averaged difference with experiment of 7 x 10(-4) g/cm3.},

Here, we further advance simulation accuracy by improving the amino acid side-chain torsion potentials of the Amber ff99SB force field. First, we used simulations of model alpha-helical systems to identify the four residue types whose rotamer distribution differed the most from expectations based on Protein Data Bank statistics. Second, we optimized the side-chain torsion potentials of these residues to match new, high-level quantum-mechanical calculations. Finally, we used microsecond-timescale MD simulations in explicit solvent to validate the resulting force field against a large set of experimental NMR measurements that directly probe side-chain conformations. The new force field, which we have termed Amber ff99SB-ILDN, exhibits considerably better agreement with the NMR data.},

A single-nucleotide polymorphism in the proregion of BDNF, termed the Val66Met polymorphism, results in deficient subcellular translocation and activity-dependent secretion of BDNF, and has been associated with impaired neurocognitive function in healthy adults and in the incidence and clinical features of several psychiatric disorders. Research investigating the Val66Met polymorphism has increased markedly in the past decade, and a gap in integration exists between and within academic subfields interested in the effects of this variant. Here we comprehensively review the role and relevance of the Val66Met polymorphism in psychiatric disorders, with emphasis on suicidal behavior and anxiety, eating, mood and psychotic disorders. The cognitive and molecular neuroscience of the Val66Met polymorphism is also concisely reviewed to illustrate the effects of this genetic variant in healthy controls, and is complemented by a commentary on the behavioral neuroscience of BDNF and the Val66Met polymorphism where relevant to specific disorders. Lastly, a number of controversies and unresolved issues, including small effect sizes, sampling of allele inheritance but not genotype and putative ethnicity-specific effects of the Val66Met polymorphism, are also discussed to direct future research.},

abstract = {Collapse of unfolded protein chains is an early event in folding. It affects structural properties of intrinsically disordered proteins, which take a considerable fraction of the human proteome. Collapse is generally believed to be driven by hydrophobic forces imposed by the presence of nonpolar amino acid side chains. Contributions from backbone hydrogen bonds to protein folding and stability, however, are controversial. To date, the experimental dissection of side-chain and backbone contributions has not yet been achieved because both types of interactions are integral parts of protein structure. Here, we realized this goal by applying mutagenesis and chemical modification on a set of disordered peptides and proteins. We measured the protein dimensions and kinetics of intra-chain diffusion of modified polypeptides at the level of individual molecules using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, thereby avoiding artifacts commonly caused by aggregation of unfolded protein material in bulk. We found no contributions from side chains to collapse but, instead, identified backbone interactions as a source sufficient to form globules of native-like dimensions. The presence of backbone hydrogen bonds decreased polypeptide water solubility dramatically and accelerated the nanosecond kinetics of loop closure, in agreement with recent predictions from computer simulation. The presence of side chains, instead, slowed loop closure and modulated the dimensions of intrinsically disordered domains. It appeared that the transient formation of backbone interactions facilitates the diffusive search for productive conformations at the early stage of folding and within intrinsically disordered proteins.},

abstract = {Cell death is a prominent feature of the developing vertebrate nervous system, affecting neurons, glial cells and their progenitors. The most extensively studied and best understood phase of cell death occurs in populations of neurons shortly after they begin establishing connections with other neurons and/or non-neural tissues. This phase of cell death makes appropriate adjustments to the relative sizes of interconnected groups of neurons and matches the size of neuronal populations that innervate non-neural tissues to the optimal requirements of these tissues. The fate of neurons during this period of development is regulated by a variety of secreted proteins that either promote survival or bring about cell death after binding to receptors expressed on the neurons. These proteins may be derived from the targets the neurons innervate, the afferents they receive or from associated glial cells, or they may be secreted by the neurons themselves. In this review, I will outline the established and emerging principles that modulate neuronal number in the developing nervous system.},

We report a Monte Carlo study that aims to elucidate the role of disordered regions adjacent to such binding motifs. The coarse-grained simulations show that small hydrophobic peptides without disordered flanks tend to aggregate under conditions where peptides embedded in unstructured peptide sequences are stable as monomers or as part of small micelle-like clusters. Surprisingly, the binding free energy of the motif is barely decreased by the presence of disordered flanking regions, although it is sensitive to the loss of entropy of the motif itself upon binding. This latter effect allows for reversible binding of the signalling motif to the substrate. The work provides insights into a mechanism that prevents the aggregation of signalling peptides, distinct from the general mechanism of protein folding, and provides a testable hypothesis to explain the abundance of disordered regions in proteins.},

abstract = {Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), after activity-dependent secretion from neurons, modulates critical nervous system functions. Recently, a variant in the human bdnf gene, resulting in a valine to methionine substitution in the prodomain, has been shown to lead to defective regulated secretion from neurons and memory impairment. Here, we report a novel function for a Vps10p domain protein, sortilin, in controlling BDNF sorting to the regulated secretory pathway. Sortilin interacts specifically with BDNF in a region encompassing the methionine substitution and colocalizes with BDNF in secretory granules in neurons. A truncated form of sortilin causes BDNF missorting to the constitutive secretory pathway without affecting neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) secretion. In addition, sortilin small interfering RNA introduced into primary neurons also led to BDNF missorting from the regulated to the constitutive secretory pathway. Together, these data suggest a mechanism to understand the defect associated with variant BDNF and provide a framework, based on divergent presynaptic regulation of sorting to secretory pathways, to explain how two ligands for tropomyosin-related kinase B, BDNF and NT-4, can mediate diverse biological responses.},

abstract = {Understanding the function of intrinsically disordered proteins is intimately related to our capacity to correctly sample their conformational dynamics. So far, a gap between experimentally and computationally derived ensembles exists, as simulations show overcompacted conformers. Increasing evidence suggests that the solvent plays a crucial role in shaping the ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins and has led to several attempts to modify water parameters and thereby favor protein–water over protein–protein interactions. This study tackles the problem from a different perspective, which is the use of the Kirkwood–Buff theory of solutions to reproduce the correct conformational ensemble of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). A protein force field recently developed on such a basis was found to be highly effective in reproducing ensembles for a fragment from the FG-rich nucleoporin 153, with dimensions matching experimental values obtained from small-angle X-ray scattering and single molecul...},

@article{Campen2008,
abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins carry out various biological functions while lacking ordered secondary and/or tertiary structure. In order to find general intrinsic properties of amino acid residues that are responsible for the absence of ordered structure in intrinsically disordered proteins we surveyed 517 amino acid scales. Each of these scales was taken as an independent attribute for the subsequent analysis. For a given attribute value X, which is averaged over a consecutive string of amino acids, and for a given data set having both ordered and disordered segments, the conditional probabilities P(s(o) | x) and P(s(d) | x) for order and disorder, respectively, can be determined for all possible values of X. Plots of the conditional probabilities P(s(o) | x) and P(s(o) | x) versus X give a pair of curves. The area between these two curves divided by the total area of the graph gives the area ratio value (ARV), which is proportional to the degree of separation of the two probability curves and, therefore, provides a measure of the given attribute's power to discriminate between order and disorder. As ARV falls between zero and one, larger ARV corresponds to the better discrimination between order and disorder. Starting from the scale with the highest ARV, we applied a simulated annealing procedure to search for alternative scale values and have managed to increase the ARV by more than 10{\%}. The ranking of the amino acids in this new TOP-IDP scale is as follows (from order promoting to disorder promoting): W, F, Y, I, M, L, V, N, C, T, A, G, R, D, H, Q, K, S, E, P. A web-based server has been created to apply the TOP-IDP scale to predict intrinsically disordered proteins (http://www.disprot.org/dev/disindex.php).},

abstract = {Of the 20 amino acids, the precise function of methionine (Met) remains among the least well understood. To establish a determining characteristic of methionine that fundamentally differentiates it from purely hydrophobic residues, we have used in vitro cellular experiments, molecular simulations, quantum calculations, and a bioinformatics screen of the Protein Data Bank. We show that approximately one-third of all known protein structures contain an energetically stabilizing Met-aromatic motif and, remarkably, that greater than 10,000 structures contain this motif more than 10 times. Critically, we show that as compared with a purely hydrophobic interaction, the Met-aromatic motif yields an additional stabilization of 1-1.5 kcal/mol. To highlight its importance and to dissect the energetic underpinnings of this motif, we have studied two clinically relevant TNF ligand-receptor complexes, namely TRAIL-DR5 and LT$\alpha$-TNFR1. In both cases, we show that the motif is necessary for high affinity ligand binding as well as function. Additionally, we highlight previously overlooked instances of the motif in several disease-related Met mutations. Our results strongly suggest that the Met-aromatic motif should be exploited in the rational design of therapeutics targeting a range of proteins.},

Improved chemical shift predictions result from population-weighted sampling of multiple conformational states and from sampling smaller fluctuations within conformational basins. Improved chemical shift predictions also result from discrete changes to conformations observed in X-ray structures, which may result from crystal contacts, and are not always reflective of conformational dynamics in solution.

abstract = {Background: Prediction of 3-dimensional protein structures from amino acid sequences represents one of the most important problems in computational structural biology. The community-wide Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) experiments have been designed to obtain an objective assessment of the state-of-the-art of the field, where I-TASSER was ranked as the best method in the server section of the recent 7th CASP experiment. Our laboratory has since then received numerous requests about the public availability of the I-TASSER algorithm and the usage of the I-TASSER predictions. Results: An on-line version of I-TASSER is developed at the KU Center for Bioinformatics which has generated protein structure predictions for thousands of modeling requests from more than 35 countries. A scoring function (C-score) based on the relative clustering structural density and the consensus significance score of multiple threading templates is introduced to estimate the accuracy of the I-TASSER predictions. A large-scale benchmark test demonstrates a strong correlation between the C-score and the TM-score (a structural similarity measurement with values in [0, 1]) of the first models with a correlation coefficient of 0.91. Using a C-score cutoff {\textgreater} -1.5 for the models of correct topology, both false positive and false negative rates are below 0.1. Combining C-score and protein length, the accuracy of the I-TASSER models can be predicted with an average error of 0.08 for TM-score and 2 {\AA} for RMSD. Conclusion: The I-TASSER server has been developed to generate automated full-length 3D protein structural predictions where the benchmarked scoring system helps users to obtain quantitative assessments of the I-TASSER models. The output of the I-TASSER server for each query includes up to five full-length models, the confidence score, the estimated TM-score and RMSD, and the standard deviation of the estimations. The I-TASSER server is freely available to the academic community at http://zhang.bioinformatics.ku.edu/I-TASSER.},

abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are unorthodox proteins that do not form three-dimensional structures under non-denaturing conditions, but perform important biological functions. In addition, IDPs are associated with many critical diseases including cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, and viral diseases. Due to the generic name of "unstructured" proteins used for IDPs in the early days, the notion that IDPs would be completely unstructured down to the level of secondary structures has prevailed for a long time. During the last two decades, ample evidence has been accumulated showing that IDPs in their target-free state are pre-populated with transient secondary structures critical for target binding. Nevertheless, such a message did not seem to have reached with sufficient clarity to the IDP or protein science community largely because similar but different expressions were used to denote the fundamentally same phenomenon of presence of such transient secondary structures, which is not surprising for a quickly evolving field. Here, we summarize the critical roles that these transient secondary structures play for diverse functions of IDPs by describing how various expressions referring to transient secondary structures have been used in different contexts.},

abstract = {Understanding protein folding is one of the most challenging problems remaining in molecular biology. In this chapter, a highly parallel replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) method and its application to protein folding are described. The REMD method couples molecular dynamics trajectories with a temperature exchange Monte Carlo process for efficient sampling of the conformational space. A series of replicas are run in parallel at temperatures ranging from the desired temperature to a high temperature at which the replica can easily surmount the energy barriers. From time to time the configurations of neighboring replicas are exchanged and this exchange is accepted or rejected based on a Metropolis acceptance criterion that guarantees the detailed balance. Two example protein systems, one alpha-helix and one beta-hairpin, are used as case studies to demonstrate the power of the algorithm. Up to 64 replicas of solvated protein systems are simulated in parallel over a wide range of temperatures. The simulation results show that the combined trajectories in temperature and configurational space allow a replica to overcome free energy barriers present at low temperatures. These large-scale simulations also reveal detailed results on folding mechanisms, intermediate state structures, thermodynamic properties, and the temperature dependences for both protein systems.},

By changing the charge of amino acid side chains, posttranslational modification by protons can drive dynamic changes in protein conformation and function. Addition and removal of a proton is rapid and reversible and, in contrast to most other posttranslational modifications, does not require an enzyme. Signaling specificity is achieved by only a minority of sites in proteins titrating within the physiological pH range.

Their high degree of disorder makes them more challenging to study using the techniques of conventional structural biology, because any observable will be averaged over a heterogeneous ensemble of structures. Molecular simulations and theory are therefore a natural complement to experiment for studying the structure, dynamics and function of IDPs. The diverse time and length scales relevant to the roles played by IDPs require flexibility in the techniques applied. Here, I summarize some of the developments in simulation and theory in recent years, which have been driven by the desire to better capture IDP properties at different time- and length-scales.

The effect of sequence variation on alpha-helix formation for alanine-rich peptides, Ac-Ala21-methyl amide (A21) and Ac-A5 (AAARA)3A-methyl amide (Fs peptide), is investigated by atomic simulation studies of the thermodynamics of the helix-coil transition in explicit water. The simulations show that the guanidinium group in the Arg side chains in the Fs peptide interacts with the carbonyl group four amino acids upstream in the chain and desolvates backbone hydrogen bonds. This desolvation can be directly correlated with a higher probability of hydrogen bond formation. We find that Fs has higher helical content than A21 at all temperatures. A small modification in the amber force field reproduces the experimental helical content and helix-coil transition temperatures for the Fs peptide.},

abstract = {Clinical studies consistently demonstrate that a single sub-psychomimetic dose of ketamine, an ionotropic glutamatergic NMDAR (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor) antagonist, produces fast-acting antidepressant responses in patients suffering from major depressive disorder, although the underlying mechanism is unclear. Depressed patients report the alleviation of major depressive disorder symptoms within two hours of a single, low-dose intravenous infusion of ketamine, with effects lasting up to two weeks, unlike traditional antidepressants (serotonin re-uptake inhibitors), which take weeks to reach efficacy. This delay is a major drawback to current therapies for major depressive disorder and faster-acting antidepressants are needed, particularly for suicide-risk patients. The ability of ketamine to produce rapidly acting, long-lasting antidepressant responses in depressed patients provides a unique opportunity to investigate underlying cellular mechanisms. Here we show that ketamine and other NMDAR antagonists produce fast-acting behavioural antidepressant-like effects in mouse models, and that these effects depend on the rapid synthesis of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. We find that the ketamine-mediated blockade of NMDAR at rest deactivates eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) kinase (also called CaMKIII), resulting in reduced eEF2 phosphorylation and de-suppression of translation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Furthermore, we find that inhibitors of eEF2 kinase induce fast-acting behavioural antidepressant-like effects. Our findings indicate that the regulation of protein synthesis by spontaneous neurotransmission may serve as a viable therapeutic target for the development of fast-acting antidepressants.},

abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are a set of proteins that lack a definite secondary structure in solution. IDPs can acquire tertiary structure when bound to their partners; therefore, the recognition process must also involve protein folding. The nature of the transition state (TS), structured or unstructured, determines the binding mechanism. The characterization of the TS has become a major challenge for experimental techniques and molecular simulations approaches since diffusion, recognition, and binding is coupled to folding. In this work we present atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that sample the free energy surface of the coupled folding and binding of the transcription factor c-myb to the cotranscription factor CREB binding protein (CBP). This process has been recently studied and became a model to study IDPs. Despite the plethora of available information, we still do not know how c-myb binds to CBP.

@article{Bah2016,
abstract = {Post-translational modifications (PTMs) produce significant changes in the structural properties of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) by affecting their energy landscapes. PTMs can induce a range of effects, from local stabilization or destabi-lization of transient secondary structure to global disorder-to-order transitions, potentially driving complete state changes between intrinsically disordered and folded states or dispersed monomeric and phase-separated states. Here, we discuss diverse biological processes that are dependent on PTM regulation of IDPs. We also present recent tools for generating homogenously modified IDPs for studies of PTM-mediated IDP regulatory mechanisms. The amino acid sequences of intrinsically disordered pro-teins or protein regions (often simply referred to as IDPs) 3 determine their inability to fold into stable tertiary structures under physiological conditions and instead enable them to rap-idly interconvert between distinct conformations to mediate critical biological functions (1, 2). The amino acid compositions of IDPs range from very low complexity with little diversity in residue types to much higher sequence complexity that enables disorder-to-order transitions upon binding or post-transla-tional modifications (PTMs) (3–5). This range of sequence composition leads to heterogeneous ensembles with variable hydrodynamic properties and fluctuating secondary and terti-ary structure, with some IDPs able to self-associate in phase-separated protein-dense droplets (6 –11). Structural heteroge-neity and dynamic fluctuations endow IDPs with unique advantages over folded proteins for certain roles (12–14). IDPs expose, at least transiently, their entire primary sequence for binding, enabling multiple interactions along their polypeptide chains. This makes them hubs in protein complexes and inte-grators in signaling networks (15–19). IDPs also facilitate the multivalent interactions that drive phase separation, underly-ing cellular membraneless organelles and signaling puncta (20 –22). Due to their accessibility to modifying enzymes, IDPs are the predominant sites of PTMs, which significantly expands their functional versatility (3, 23). By changing the physicochemical properties of the primary sequence, PTMs induce a range of structural changes, from local stabilization or destabilization of transient secondary structure to more global conformational changes in disorder-to-order transitions (24, 25). As the hydro-dynamic properties of IDPs are strongly affected by electro-static effects, PTMs that change charge (e.g. phosphorylation and acetylation) can modulate compactness (9 –11). PTMs can also lead to complete state changes, between disordered and folded states (26 –28) or dispersed monomeric and phase-sep-arated states (6, 8, 22). The scope of PTM-mediated structural and dynamic changes described in recent biophysical and bio-chemical studies of IDPs is similar to those due to binding to other proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, carbohydrates, ions, cofac-tors, and other small molecules (4, 29, 30). Here we review the effects of PTMs on IDP structure and function and how such effects regulate fundamental biological processes, from PTM-mediated conformational transitions of individual IDPs to the assembly of multi-protein complexes and the formation of membraneless protein organelles. We begin by presenting the diversity of PTMs and their effects on IDP struc-ture and function and then focus on phosphorylation, one of the most common PTMs. Because the investigation of PTM effects on IDPs is often limited by the ability to generate homo-geneously modified samples, we discuss recent advances in recombinant protein expression systems and chemical synthe-sis strategies for producing modified IDP samples. These enable detailed biochemical and biophysical characterization using general methods for IDPs as well as those specific for IDPs with PTMs (4, 30, 31)},

abstract = {Background: PAGE4, an intrinsically disordered protein up-regulated in prostate cancer, binds to c-Jun and potentiates its transactivation. Results: The effects of phosphorylation on PAGE4 conformation, dynamics, and c-Jun binding were determined by NMR. Conclusion: Phosphorylation induces a more compact conformational ensemble, restricting access to the c-Jun binding site. Significance: This study may help to explain how phosphorylation of PAGE4 alters its binding to c-Jun. Prostate-associated gene 4 (PAGE4) is an intrinsically disor-dered cancer/testis antigen that is up-regulated in the fetal and diseased human prostate. Knocking down PAGE4 expression results in cell death, whereas its overexpression leads to a growth advantage of prostate cancer cells (Zeng, Y., He, Y., Yang, F., Mooney, S. M., Getzenberg, R. H., Orban, J., and Kulkarni, P. (2011) The cancer/testis antigen prostate-associ-ated gene 4 (PAGE4) is a highly intrinsically disordered protein. J. Biol. Chem. 286, 13985–13994). Phosphorylation of PAGE4 at Thr-51 is critical for potentiating c-Jun transactivation, an important factor in controlling cell growth, apoptosis, and stress response. Using NMR spectroscopy, we show that the PAGE4 polypeptide chain has local and long-range conformational preferences that are perturbed by site-specific phosphorylation at Thr-51. The population of transient turn-like structures increases upon phosphorylation in an ϳ20-residue acidic region centered on Thr-51. This central region therefore becomes more compact and more negatively charged, with increasing intramolecular contacts to basic sequence motifs near the N and C termini. Although flexibility is decreased in the central region of phospho-PAGE4, the polypeptide chain remains highly},

abstract = {Long-lasting forms of memory are generally believed to be mediated by protein synthesis-dependent, late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP). L-LTP exhibits at least two distinctive characteristics compared with early phase LTP (E-LTP): synaptic growth and requirement of gene transcription and new protein synthesis. In this review, we discuss the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the structural and functional changes of hippocampal synapses during L-LTP, in the context of long-term memory. We describe experiments that reveal the critical role of cAMP/protein kinase A and MAP kinase pathways, and the downstream transcription factor CREB. Because transcription-dependent long-term changes are input specific, we also discuss the role of "local protein synthesis" and "synaptic tagging" mechanisms that may confer synapse specificity. We then focus on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), two secreted proteins that have been repeatedly implicated in L-LTP. Biochemical and molecular biology experiments indicate that the expression and secretion of both factors are enhanced by strong tetanic stimulation that induces L-LTP as well as by training in hippocampal-dependent memory tasks. Inhibition of either tPA or BDNF by gene knockout and specific inhibitors results in a significant impairments in L-LTP and long-term memory. Further work will be required to address the relationship between BDNF and tPA in various forms of synaptic plasticity, and the mechanisms by which BDNF/tPA achieves synapse-specific modulation. Finally, we discuss how the aging process affects L-LTP and long-term memory.},

We also extended the calculations to very large proteins and macromolecular complexes, such as the whole 70S ribosome.

abstract = {The role of side-chain entropy (SCE) in protein folding has long been speculated about but is still not fully understood. Utilizing a newly developed Monte Carlo method, we conducted a systematic investigation of how the SCE relates to the size of the protein and how it differs among a protein's X-ray, NMR, and decoy structures. We estimated the SCE for a set of 675 nonhomologous proteins, and observed that there is a significant SCE for both exposed and buried residues for all these proteins—the contribution of buried residues approaches ∼40{\%} of the overall SCE. Furthermore, the SCE can be quite different for structures with similar compactness or even similar conformations. As a striking example, we found that proteins' X-ray structures appear to pack more “cleverly” than their NMR or decoy counterparts in the sense of retaining higher SCE while achieving comparable compactness, which suggests that the SCE plays an important role in favouring native protein structures. By including a SCE term in a simple free energy function, we can significantly improve the discrimination of native protein structures from decoys.},

In human subjects, the met allele was associated with poorer episodic memory, abnormal hippocampal activation assayed with fMRI, and lower hippocampal n-acetyl aspartate (NAA), assayed with MRI spectroscopy. Neurons transfected with met-BDNF-GFP showed lower depolarization-induced secretion, while constitutive secretion was unchanged.

Elastin and elastin-like peptides are hydrophobic, disordered, and undergo liquid-liquid phase separation upon self-assembly. Despite extensive study, the structure of elastin remains controversial. We use molecular dynamics simulations on a massive scale to elucidate the structural ensemble of aggregated elastin-like peptides. Consistent with the entropic nature of elastic recoil, the aggregated state is stabilized by the hydrophobic effect. However, self-assembly does not entail formation of a hydrophobic core. The polypeptide backbone forms transient, sparse hydrogen-bonded turns and remains significantly hydrated even as self-assembly triples the extent of non-polar side chain contacts. Individual chains in the assembly approach a maximally-disordered, melt-like state which may be called the liquid state of proteins. These findings resolve long-standing controversies regarding elastin structure and function and afford insight into the phase separation of disordered proteins.},

abstract = {Protein aggregation is a commonly occurring problem in biology. Cells have evolved stress-response mechanisms to cope with problems posed by protein aggregation. Yet, these quality control mechanisms are overwhelmed by chronic aggregation-related stress and the resultant consequences of aggregation become toxic to cells. As a result, a variety of systemic and neurodegenerative diseases are associated with various aspects of protein aggregation and rational approaches to either inhibit aggregation or manipulate the pathways to aggregation might lead to an alleviation of disease phenotypes. To develop such approaches, one needs a rigorous and quantitative understanding of protein aggregation. Much work has been done in this area. However, several unanswered questions linger, and these pertain primarily to the actual mechanism of aggregation as well as to the types of inter-molecular associations and intramolecular fluctuations realized at low protein concentrations. It has been suggested that the concepts underlying protein aggregation are similar to those used to describe the aggregation of synthetic polymers. Following this suggestion, the relevant concepts of polymer aggregation are introduced. The focus is on explaining the driving forces for polymer aggregation and how these driving forces vary with chain length and solution conditions. It is widely accepted that protein aggregation is a nucleation-dependent process. This view is based mainly on the presence of long times for the accumulation of aggregates and the elimination of these lag times with "seeds". In this sense, protein aggregation is viewed as being analogous to the aggregation of colloidal particles. The theories for polymer aggregation reviewed in this work suggest an alternative mechanism for the origin of long lag times in protein aggregation. The proposed mechanism derives from the recognition that polymers have unique dynamics that distinguish them from other aggregation-prone systems such as colloidal particles.},

Understanding IDP regulation is important because altered expression of IDPs is associated with many diseases. Recent studies show that IDPs are tightly regulated and that dosage-sensitive genes encode proteins with disordered segments. The tight regulation of IDPs may contribute to signaling fidelity by ensuring that IDPs are available in appropriate amounts and not present longer than needed. The altered availability of IDPs may result in sequestration of proteins through non-functional interactions involving disordered segments (i.e., molecular titration), thereby causing an imbalance in signaling pathways. We discuss the regulation of IDPs, address implications for signaling, disease and drug development, and outline directions for future research.},

abstract = {Functional characterization of a protein sequence is one of the most frequent problems in biology. This task is usually facilitated by accurate three-dimensional (3-D) structure of the studied protein. In the absence of an experimentally determined structure, comparative or homology modeling can sometimes provide a useful 3-D model for a protein that is related to at least one known protein structure. Comparative modeling predicts the 3-D structure of a given protein sequence (target) based primarily on its alignment to one or more proteins of known structure (templates). The prediction process consists of fold assignment, target-template alignment, model building, and model evaluation. This unit describes how to calculate comparative models using the program MODELLER and discusses all four steps of comparative modeling, frequently observed errors, and some applications. Modeling lactate dehydrogenase from Trichomonas vaginalis (TvLDH) is described as an example. The download and installation of the MODELLER software is also described. Curr. Protoc.

Results obtained by using PDB data show strong correlations between adjacent torsion angle pairs belonging to both the same and different residues. These correlations favor the choice of the native-state torsion angles, and they are strongly context dependent, determined by the specific amino acid sequence of the protein. Excluded volume or steric clashes, only, do not introduce context-dependent phipsi correlations into the chain that would affect the choice of native-state torsional angles.},

As validation, we show that the optimized force fields produce results in excellent agreement with nuclear magnetic resonance experiments for folded proteins and short peptides not used in the optimization. However, despite the agreement at ambient conditions, the dependence of the helix content on temperature is too weak, a problem shared with other force fields.

abstract = {The unfolded state of globular proteins is not well described by a simple statistical coil due to residual structural features, such as secondary structure or transiently formed long-range contacts. The principle of minimal frustration predicts that the unfolded ensemble is biased toward productive regions in the conformational space determined by the native structure. Transient long-range contacts, both native-like and non-native-like, have previously been shown to be present in the unfolded state of the four-helix-bundle protein acyl co-enzyme binding protein (ACBP) as seen from both perturbations in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts and structural ensembles generated from NMR paramagnetic relaxation data. To study the nature of the contacts in detail, we used paramagnetic NMR relaxation enhancements, in combination with single-point mutations, to obtain distance constraints for the acid-unfolded ensemble of ACBP. We show that, even in the acid-unfolded state, long-range contacts are specific in nature and single-point mutations affect the free-energy landscape of the unfolded protein. Using this approach, we were able to map out concerted, interconnected, and productive long-range contacts. The correlation between the native-state stability and compactness of the denatured state provides further evidence for native-like contact formation in the denatured state. Overall, these results imply that, even in the earliest stages of folding, ACBP dynamics are governed by native-like contacts on a minimally frustrated energy landscape.},

These proteins have interesting structural properties that deviate from the random-coil-like behavior exhibited by chemically denatured proteins. In particular, IDPs are often observed to exhibit significant compaction. In this study, we have analyzed the hydrodynamic radii of a number of IDPs to investigate the sequence determinants of this compaction. Net charge and proline content are observed to be strongly correlated with increased hydrodynamic radii, suggesting that these are the dominant contributors to compaction. Hydrophobicity and secondary structure, on the other hand, appear to have negligible effects on compaction, which implies that the determinants of structure in folded and intrinsically disordered proteins are profoundly different. Finally, we observe that polyhistidine tags seem to increase IDP compaction, which suggests that these tags have significant perturbing effects and thus should be removed before any structural characterizations of IDPs. Using the relationships observed in this analysis, we have developed a sequence-based predictor of hydrodynamic radius for IDPs that shows substantial improvement over a simple model based upon chain length alone.},

abstract = {A human variant in the BDNF gene (Val66Met; rs6265) is associated with impaired fear extinction. Using super-resolution imaging, we demonstrate that the BDNF Met prodomain disassembles dendritic spines and eliminates synapses in hippocampal neurons. In vivo, ventral CA1 (vCA1) hippocampal neurons undergo similar morphological changes dependent on their transient co-expression of a SorCS2/p75NTR receptor complex during peri-adolescence. BDNF Met prodomain infusion into the vCA1 during this developmental time frame reduces dendritic spine density and prelimbic (PL) projections, impairing cued fear extinction. Adolescent BdnfMet/Met mice display similar spine and PL innervation deficits. Using fiber photometry, we found that, in wild-type mice, vCA1 neurons projecting to the PL encode extinction by enhancing neural activity in threat anticipation and rapidly subsiding their response. This adaptation is absent in BDNFMet/Met mice. We conclude that the BDNF Met prodomain renders vCA1-PL projection neurons underdeveloped, preventing their capacity for subsequent circuit modulation necessary for fear extinction.

abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) carry out crucial biological functions in essential biological processes of life. Because of the highly dynamic and conformationally heterogeneous nature of the disordered states of IDPs, molecular dynamics simulations are becoming an indispensable tool for the investigation of the conformational ensembles and dynamic properties of IDPs. Nevertheless, there is still no consensus on the most reliable force field in molecular dynamics simulations for IDPs hitherto. In this work, the recently proposed AMBER99SB2D force field is evaluated in modeling some disordered polypeptides and proteins by checking its ability to reproduce experimental NMR data. The results highlight that when the ildn side-chain corrections are included, AMBER99SB2D-ildn exhibits reliable results that agree with experiments compared with its predecessors, the AMBER14SB, AMBER99SB, AMBER99SB-ildn, and AMBER99SB2D force fields, and that decreasing the overall magnitude of protein–protein interactio...},

abstract = {For disordered proteins, the dimensions of the chain are an important property that is sensitive to environmental conditions. We have used single-molecule F{\"{o}}rster resonance energy transfer to probe the temperature-induced chain collapse of five unfolded or intrinsically disordered proteins. Because this behavior is sensitive to the details of intrachain and chain-solvent interactions, the collapse allows us to probe the physical interactions governing the dimensions of disordered proteins. We find that each of the proteins undergoes a collapse with increasing temperature, with the most hydrophobic one, $\lambda$-repressor, undergoing a reexpansion at the highest temperatures. Although such a collapse might be expected due to the temperature dependence of the classical "hydrophobic effect," remarkably we find that the largest collapse occurs for the most hydrophilic, charged sequences. Using a combination of theory and simulation, we show that this result can be rationalized in terms of the temperature-dependent solvation free energies of the constituent amino acids, with the solvation properties of the most hydrophilic residues playing a large part in determining the collapse.},

abstract = {The dimensions of unfolded and intrinsically disordered proteins are highly dependent on their amino acid composition and solution conditions, especially salt and denaturant concentration. However, the quantitative implications of this behavior have remained unclear, largely because the effective theta-state, the central reference point for the underlying polymer collapse transition, has eluded experimental determination. Here, we used single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy and two-focus correlation spectroscopy to determine the theta points for six different proteins. While the scaling exponents of all proteins converge to 0.62 ± 0.03 at high denaturant concentrations, as expected for a polymer in good solvent, the scaling regime in water strongly depends on sequence composition. The resulting average scaling exponent of 0.46 ± 0.05 for the four foldable protein sequences in our study suggests that the aqueous cellular milieu is close to effective theta conditions for unfolded proteins. In contrast, two intrinsically disordered proteins do not reach the $\Theta$-point under any of our solvent conditions, which may reflect the optimization of their expanded state for the interactions with cellular partners. Sequence analyses based on our results imply that foldable sequences with more compact unfolded states are a more recent result of protein evolution.},

Here we develop a novel approach using residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) from unfolded proteins to determine conformational behavior on an amino acid specific basis. Conformational sampling is described in terms of ensembles of structures selected from a large pool of conformers. We test this approach, using extensive simulation, to determine how well the fitting of RDCs to reduced conformational ensembles containing few copies of the molecule can correctly reproduce the backbone conformational behavior of the protein. Having established approaches that allow accurate mapping of backbone dihedral angle conformational space from RDCs, we apply these methods to obtain an amino acid specific description of ubiquitin denatured in 8 M urea at pH 2.5. Cross-validation of data not employed in the fit verifies that an ensemble size of 200 structures is appropriate to characterize the highly fluctuating backbone. This approach allows us to identify local conformational sampling properties of urea-unfolded ubiquitin, which shows that the backbone sampling of certain types of charged or polar amino acids, in particular threonine, glutamic acid, and arginine, is affected more strongly by urea binding than amino acids with hydrophobic side chains. In general, the approach presented here establishes robust procedures for the study of all denatured and intrinsically disordered states.},

Given that current force fields differ significantly in their R-helical propensities, a correction to match experimental results would be highly desirable. We have determined simple backbone energy corrections for two force fields to reproduce the fraction of helix measured in short peptides at 300 K. As validation, we show that the optimized force fields produce results in excellent agreement with nuclear magnetic resonance experiments for folded proteins and short peptides not used in the optimization. However, despite the agreement at ambient conditions, the dependence of the helix content on temperature is too weak, a problem shared with other force fields. A fit of the Lifson-Roig helix-coil theory shows that both the enthalpy and entropy of helix formation are too small: the helix extension parameter w agrees well with experiment, but its entropic and enthalpic components are both only about half the respective experimental estimates. Our structural and thermodynamic analyses point toward the physical origins of these shortcomings in current force fields, and suggest ways to address them in future force-field development.},

Gal11 activator-binding domain 1 has a four-helix fold with a small shallow hydrophobic cleft at its center. In the bound complex, eight residues of Gcn4 adopt a helical conformation, allowing three Gcn4 aromatic/aliphatic residues to insert into the Gal11 cleft. The protein-protein interface is dynamic and surprisingly simple, involving only hydrophobic interactions. This allows Gcn4 to bind Gal11 in multiple conformations and orientations, an example of a “fuzzy” complex, where the Gcn4-Gal11 interface cannot be described by a single conformation. Gcn4 uses a similar mechanism to bind two other unrelated activator-binding domains. Functional studies in yeast show the importance of residues at the protein interface, define the minimal requirements for a functional activator, and suggest a mechanism by which activators bind to multiple unrelated targets.},

abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), which are expected to be largely unstructured under physiological conditions, make up a large fraction of eukaryotic proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations have been utilized to probe structural characteristics of these proteins, which are not always easily accessible to experiments. However, exploration of the conformational space by brute force molecular dynamics simulations is often limited by short time scales. Present literature provides a number of enhanced sampling methods to explore protein conformational space in molecular simulations more efficiently. In this work, we present a comparison of two enhanced sampling methods: temperature replica exchange molecular dynamics and bias exchange metadynamics. By investigating both the free energy landscape as a function of pertinent order parameters and the per-residue secondary structures of an IDP, namely, human islet amyloid polypeptide, we found that the two methods yield similar results as expected. We also highlight the practical difference between the two methods by describing the path that we followed to obtain both sets of data.},

abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are unorthodox proteins that do not form three-dimensional structures under non-denaturing conditions, but perform important biological functions. In addition, IDPs are associated with many critical diseases including cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, and viral diseases. Due to the generic name of "unstructured" proteins used for IDPs in the early days, the notion that IDPs would be completely unstructured down to the level of secondary structures has prevailed for a long time. During the last two decades, ample evidence has been accumulated showing that IDPs in their target-free state are pre-populated with transient secondary structures critical for target binding. Nevertheless, such a message did not seem to have reached with sufficient clarity to the IDP or protein science community largely because similar but different expressions were used to denote the fundamentally same phenomenon of presence of such transient secondary structures, which is not surprising for a quickly evolving field. Here, we summarize the critical roles that these transient secondary structures play for diverse functions of IDPs by describing how various expressions referring to transient secondary structures have been used in different contexts.},

abstract = {Most models of protein evolution are based upon proteins that form relatively rigid 3D structures. A significant fraction of proteins, the so-called disordered proteins, do not form rigid 3D structures and sample a broad conformational ensemble. Disordered proteins do not typically maintain long-range interactions, so the constraints on their evolution should be different than ordered proteins. To test this hypothesis, we developed and compared models of evolution for disordered and ordered proteins. Substitution matrices were constructed using the sequences of putative homologs for sets of experimentally characterized disordered and ordered proteins. Separate matrices, at three levels of sequence similarity ({\textgreater}85{\%}, 85-60{\%}, and 60-40{\%}), were inferred for each type of protein structure. The substitution matrices for disordered and ordered proteins differed significantly at each level of sequence similarity. The disordered matrices reflected a greater likelihood of evolutionary changes, relative to the ordered matrices, and these changes involved nonconservative substitutions. Glutamic acid and asparagine were interesting exceptions to this result. Important differences between the substitutions that are accepted in disordered proteins relative to ordered proteins were also identified. In general, disordered proteins have fewer evolutionary constraints than ordered proteins. However, some residues like tryptophan and tyrosine are highly conserved in disordered proteins. This is due to their important role in forming protein-protein interfaces. Finally, the amino acid frequencies for disordered proteins, computed during the development of the matrices, were compared with amino acid frequencies for different categories of secondary structure in ordered proteins. The highest correlations were observed between the amino acid frequencies in disordered proteins and the solvent-exposed loops and turns of ordered proteins, supporting an emerging structural model for disordered proteins.},

We find that, in contrast to the compact unfolded conformations that have been observed for many proteins at low denaturant concentration, IDPs can exhibit a prominent expansion at low ionic strength that correlates with their net charge. Charge-balanced polypeptides, however, can exhibit an additional collapse at low ionic strength, as predicted by polyampholyte theory from the attraction between opposite charges in the chain. The pronounced effect of charges on the dimensions of unfolded proteins has important implications for the cellular functions of IDPs.},

abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) or intrinsically disordered regions do not have a fixed tertiary structure but play key roles in signal regulation, molecule recognition, and drug targeting. However, it is difficult to study the structure and function of IDPs by traditional experimental methods because of their diverse conformations. Limitations of current generic protein force fields and solvent models were reported in the previous simulations of IDPs. We have also explored overcoming these limitations by developing the f f 99IDPs and f f14IDPs force fields to correct the dihedral distribution for eight disorder-promoting residues often observed in IDPs and found encouraging improvements. Here we extend our correction of backbone dihedral terms to all 20 naturally occurring amino acids in the IDP-specific force field f f14IDPSFF to further improve the quality of the modeling of IDPs. Extensive tests of seven IDPs and 14 unstructured short peptides show that the simulated C$\alpha$ chemical shifts obtained with the f f14IDPSFF force field are in quantitative agreement with those from NMR experiments and are more accurate than those obtained with the base generic force field and also our previous f f14IDPs that only corrects the eight disorder-promoting amino acids. The influence of the solvent model was also investigated and found to be less important. Finally, our explicit-solvent MD simulations further show that f f14IDPSFF can still be used to model structural and dynamical properties of two tested folded proteins, with a slightly better agreement in the loop regions for both structural and dynamical properties. These findings confirm that the newly developed IDP-specific force field f f14IDPSFF can improve the conformer sampling of intrinsically disordered proteins.},

abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are ubiquitous in eukaryotes, and they are often associated with diseases in humans. The protein NUPR1 is a multifunctional IDP involved in chromatin remodeling and in the development and progression of pancreatic cancer; however, the details of such functions are unknown. Polycomb proteins are involved in specific transcriptional cascades and gene silencing. One of the proteins of the Polycomb complex is the Ring finger protein 1 (RING1). RING1 is related to aggressive tumor features in multiple cancer types. In this work we characterized the interaction between NUPR1 and the paralogue RING1B in vitro, in silico, and in cellulo. The interaction occurred through the C-terminal region of RING1B (C-RING1B), with an affinity in the low micromolar range (∼10 $\mu$M). The binding region of NUPR1, mapped by NMR, was a hydrophobic polypeptide patch at the 30s region of its sequence, as pinpointed by computational results and site-directed mutagenesis at Ala33. The association between C-RING1B and wild-type NUPR1 also occurred in cellulo as tested by protein ligation assays; this interaction is inhibited by trifluoperazine, a drug known to hamper binding of wild-type NUPR1 with other proteins. Furthermore, the Thr68Gln and Ala33Gln/Thr68Gln mutants had a reduction in the binding toward C-RING1B as shown by in vitro, in silico, and in cellulo studies. This is an example of a well-folded partner of NUPR1, because its other interacting proteins are also unfolded. We hypothesize that NUPR1 plays an active role in chromatin remodeling and carcinogenesis, together with Polycomb proteins.},

abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) adopt heterogeneous ensembles of conformations under physiological conditions. Understanding the relationship between amino acid sequence and conformational ensembles of IDPs can help clarify the role of disorder in physiological function. Recent studies revealed that polar IDPs favor collapsed ensembles in water despite the absence of hydrophobic groups--a result that holds for polypeptide backbones as well. By studying highly charged polypeptides, a different archetype of IDPs, we assess how charge content modulates the intrinsic preference of polypeptide backbones for collapsed structures. We characterized conformational ensembles for a set of protamines in aqueous milieus using molecular simulations and fluorescence measurements. Protamines are arginine-rich IDPs involved in the condensation of chromatin during spermatogenesis. Simulations based on the ABSINTH implicit solvation model predict the existence of a globule-to-coil transition, with net charge per residue serving as the discriminating order parameter. The transition is supported by quantitative agreement between simulation and experiment. Local conformational preferences partially explain the observed trends of polymeric properties. Our results lead to the proposal of a schematic protein phase diagram that should enable prediction of polymeric attributes for IDP conformational ensembles using easily calculated physicochemical properties of amino acid sequences. Although sequence composition allows the prediction of polymeric properties, interresidue contact preferences of protamines with similar polymeric attributes suggest that certain details of conformational ensembles depend on the sequence. This provides a plausible mechanism for specificity in the functions of IDPs.},

abstract = {Research of a past decade and a half leaves no doubt that complete understanding of protein functionality requires close consideration of the fact that many functional proteins do not have well-folded structures. These intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and proteins with intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs) are highly abundant in nature and play a number of crucial roles in a living cell. Their functions, which are typically associated with a wide range of intermolecular interactions where IDPs possess remarkable binding promiscuity, complement functional repertoire of ordered proteins. All this requires a close attention to the peculiarities of biophysics of these proteins. In this review, some key biophysical features of IDPs are covered. In addition to the peculiar sequence characteristics of IDPs these biophysical features include sequential, structural, and spatiotemporal heterogeneity of IDPs; their rough and relatively flat energy landscapes; their ability to undergo both induced folding and induced unfolding; the ability to interact specifically with structurally unrelated partners; the ability to gain different structures at binding to different partners; and the ability to keep essential amount of disorder even in the bound form. IDPs are also characterized by the "turned-out" response to the changes in their environment, where they gain some structure under conditions resulting in denaturation or even unfolding of ordered proteins. It is proposed that the heterogeneous spatiotemporal structure of IDPs/IDPRs can be described as a set of foldons, inducible foldons, semi-foldons, non-foldons, and unfoldons. They may lose their function when folded, and activation of some IDPs is associated with the awaking of the dormant disorder. It is possible that IDPs represent the "edge of chaos" systems which operate in a region between order and complete randomness or chaos, where the complexity is maximal.

The valine (Val)66-to-methionine (Met) variant, located in the pro brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) sequence, has been extensively studied through linkage and association approaches in several psychiatric disorders. METHODS We performed a meta-analysis restricted to individual case-control studies in different categories of mental disorders and BDNF Val66Met polymorphism. We included data from 39 case-control studies encompassing psychiatric phenotypes: eating disorders, substance-related disorders, mood disorders, and schizophrenia, among others. RESULTS The association of Val66Met was confined to three diagnoses: substance-related disorders, eating disorders, and schizophrenia. The Val/Met and the Met/Met genotypes increase the risk for eating disorders up to 33{\%}, while these same genotypes confer a 21{\%} protective effect in substance-related disorders. The homozygous carriers Met/Met showed a 19{\%} increased risk of schizophrenia with respect to the heterozygous state. CONCLUSIONS The study confirms the association of Val66Met to substance-related disorders, eating disorders, and schizophrenia. It remains to be determined if other variants in tight linkage disequilibrium with Val66Met could configure an extended functional haplotype that would explain observed discrepancies in risk estimations across studies.},

These two positions were independently mutated from Ala (AA), to Cys (AC and CA), Met (AM and MA), and Phe (AF and FA) and to the pairs Phe-Met (FM), Met-Phe (MF), Phe-Cys (FC), and Cys-Phe (CF). The intrinsic helical propensities of Cys, Met, and Phe were found to be those previously described in the algorithm AGADIR. NMR analysis of the FM, MF, FC, and CF peptides showed the formation in aqueous solution of contacts between the aromatic ring and the side chains of Cys or Met, at the two i, i + 4 orientations. CD studies demonstrated the important contribution of two of these interactions (FM and FC) to alpha-helix stability (up to 2 kcal mol-1 in the Phe-Cys pair). Statistical analysis of the protein database provides a rationale for the stereospecificity and free energies of the interactions. The very favorable interaction between an aromatic ring and a sulfur-containing amino acid explains why in the protein database around 50{\%} of the sulfur atoms are contacting aromatic rings (Reid et al., 1985).},

It remains unclear if aggregated TDP-43 is neurotoxic and if {\$}50 ALS-associated missense mutations in TDP-43 CTD pro-mote aggregation, or if loss of normal function plays a role in disease. Recent work points to the ability of related proteins to assemble into functional phase-separated ribonucleoprotein granules via their struc-turally disordered prion-like domains. Here, we pro-vide atomic details on the structure and assembly of the low-complexity CTD of TDP-43 into liquid-liquid phase-separated in vitro granules and demonstrate that ALS-associated variants disrupt interactions within granules. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, simulation, and microscopy, we find that a subregion cooperatively but transiently folds into a helix that mediates TDP-43 phase sepa-ration. ALS-associated mutations disrupt phase separation by inhibiting interaction and helical sta-bilization. Therefore, ALS-associated mutations can disrupt TDP-43 interactions, affecting function beyond encouraging aggregation.},

abstract = {An elementary statistical mechanical model was used to calculate the folding rates for 22 proteins from their known three-dimensional structures. In this model, residues come into contact only after all of the intervening chain is in the native conformation. An additional simplifying assumption is that native structure grows from localized regions that then fuse to form the complete native molecule. The free energy function for this model contains just two contributions-conformational entropy of the backbone and the energy of the inter-residue contacts. The matrix of inter-residue interactions is obtained from the atomic coordinates of the three-dimensional structure. For the 18 proteins that exhibit two-state equilibrium and kinetic behavior, profiles of the free energy versus the number of native peptide bonds show two deep minima, corresponding to the native and denatured states. For four proteins known to exhibit intermediates in folding, the free energy profiles show additional deep minima. The calculated rates of folding the two-state proteins, obtained by solving a diffusion equation for motion on the free energy profiles, reproduce the experimentally determined values surprisingly well. The success of these calculations suggests that folding speed is largely determined by the distribution and strength of contacts in the native structure. We also calculated the effect of mutations on the folding kinetics of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2, the most intensively studied two-state protein, with some success.},

abstract = {The functions of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are governed by relationships between information encoded in their amino acid sequences and the ensembles of conformations that they sample as autonomous units. Most IDPs are polyampholytes, with sequences that include both positively and negatively charged residues. Accordingly, we focus here on the sequence-ensemble relationships of polyampholytic IDPs. The fraction of charged residues discriminates between weak and strong polyampholytes. Using atomistic simulations, we show that weak polyampholytes form globules, whereas the conformational preferences of strong polyampholytes are determined by a combination of fraction of charged residues values and the linear sequence distributions of oppositely charged residues. We quantify the latter using a patterning parameter $\kappa$ that lies between zero and one. The value of $\kappa$ is low for well-mixed sequences, and in these sequences, intrachain electrostatic repulsions and attractions are counterbalanced, leading to the unmasking of preferences for conformations that resemble either self-avoiding random walks or generic Flory random coils. Segregation of oppositely charged residues within linear sequences leads to high $\kappa$-values and preferences for hairpin-like conformations caused by long-range electrostatic attractions induced by conformational fluctuations. We propose a scaling theory to explain the sequence-encoded conformational properties of strong polyampholytes. We show that naturally occurring strong polyampholytes have low $\kappa$-values, and this feature implies a selection for random coil ensembles. The design of sequences with different $\kappa$-values demonstrably alters the conformational preferences of polyampholytic IDPs, and this ability could become a useful tool for enabling direct inquiries into connections between sequence-ensemble relationships and functions of IDPs.},

Molecular dynamics simulations could be a powerful tool for the structural characterization of such proteins, but it has been unclear whether the physical models (force fields) used in simulations are sufficiently accurate. Here, we systematically compare the accuracy of a number of different force fields in simulations of both ordered and disordered proteins, finding that each force field has strengths and limitations. We then describe a force field that substantially improves on the state-of-the-art accuracy for simulations of disordered proteins without sacrificing accuracy for folded proteins, thus broadening the range of biological systems amenable to molecular dynamics simulations.},

abstract = {The binding of the TRIM5$\alpha$ restriction factor to the HIV capsid is mediated by the C-terminal SPRY domain of TRIM5$\alpha$. Atomic-level details of this host-pathogen interaction, which involves mobile variable loops of the SPRY domain, remain unclear. Some of the key determinants of restriction are encompassed by the long and disordered v1 loop of the SPRY domain. We applied molecular modeling to elucidate the conformational repertoire of the v1 loop and its role in the interaction with the capsid. All-atom replica exchange molecular dynamics revealed multiple transient, interconverting states of the v1 loop consistent with the intrinsic disorder observed experimentally. The docking of the SPRY conformations representing 10 most populated states onto the high-resolution model of the assembled HIV-1 capsid revealed that a subset of v1 conformations produced plausible binding poses, in which the SPRY domain binds close to the pseudo-2-fold symmetry axis and the v1 loop spans the interhexamer gap. Such binding mode is well supported by the NMR binding data and known escape mutants. We speculate that the binding mode that involves interaction of the capsid with a subset of preexisting SPRY conformations arising from the intrinsic disorder of the v1 loop may explain the remarkable ability of TRIM5$\alpha$ to resist viral evasion by mutagenesis and to restrict divergent retroviruses.},

We report random coil chemical shifts and sequence correction factors determined for a GGXGG peptide series following the approach of Schwarzinger et al. (J Am Chem Soc 123(13):2970-2978, 2001). The chemical shifts are determined at neutral pH in order to match the conditions of most studies of intrinsically disordered proteins. Temperature has a non-negligible effect on the (13)C random coil chemical shifts, so temperature coefficients are reported for the random coil chemical shifts to allow extrapolation to other temperatures. The pH dependence of the histidine random coil chemical shifts is investigated in a titration series, which allows the accurate random coil chemical shifts to be obtained at any pH. By correcting the random coil chemical shifts for the effects of temperature and pH, systematic biases of the secondary chemical shifts are minimized, which will improve the reliability of detection of transient secondary structure in disordered proteins.},

abstract = {The synucleins are a family of intrinsically disordered proteins involved in various human diseases. alpha-Synuclein has been extensively characterized due to its role in Parkinson's disease where it forms intracellular aggregates, while gamma-synuclein is overexpressed in a majority of late-stage breast cancers. Despite fairly strong sequence similarity between the amyloid-forming regions of alpha- and gamma-synuclein, gamma-synuclein has only a weak propensity to form amyloid fibrils. We hypothesize that the different fibrillation tendencies of alpha- and gamma-synuclein may be related to differences in structural propensities. Here we have measured chemical shifts for gamma-synuclein and compared them to previously published shifts for alpha-synuclein. In order to facilitate direct comparison, we have implemented a simple new technique for re-referencing chemical shifts that we have found to be highly effective for both disordered and folded proteins. In addition, we have developed a new method that combines different chemical shifts into a single residue-specific secondary structure propensity (SSP) score. We observe significant differences between alpha- and gamma-synuclein secondary structure propensities. Most interestingly, gamma-synuclein has an increased alpha-helical propensity in the amyloid-forming region that is critical for alpha-synuclein fibrillation, suggesting that increased structural stability in this region may protect against gamma-synuclein aggregation. This comparison of residue-specific secondary structure propensities between intrinsically disordered homologs highlights the sensitivity of transient structure to sequence changes, which we suggest may have been exploited as an evolutionary mechanism for fast modulation of protein structure and, hence, function.},

Here we show that the isolated BDNF prodomain is detected in the hippocampus and that it can be secreted from neurons in an activity-dependent manner. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and circular dichroism, we find that the prodomain is intrinsically disordered, and the Val66Met substitution induces structural changes. Surprisingly, application of Met66 (but not Val66) BDNF prodomain induces acute growth cone retraction and a decrease in Rac activity in hippocampal neurons. Expression of p75(NTR) and differential engagement of the Met66 prodomain to the SorCS2 receptor are required for this effect.

One of the largest challenges in the determination of random coil chemical shifts is accounting for the effect of neighboring residues. The contributions from the neighboring residues are typically removed by using neighbor correction factors determined based on each residue's effect on glycine chemical shifts. Due to its unusual conformational freedom, glycine may be particularly unrepresentative for the remaining residue types. In this study, we use random coil peptides containing glutamine instead of glycine to determine the random coil chemical shifts and the neighbor correction factors. The resulting correction factors correlate to changes in the populations of the major wells in the Ramachandran plot, which demonstrates that changes in the conformational ensemble are an important source of neighbor effects in disordered proteins. Glutamine derived random coil chemical shifts and correction factors modestly improve our ability to predict (13)C chemical shifts of intrinsically disordered proteins compared to existing datasets, and may thus improve the identification of small populations of transient structure in disordered proteins.},

abstract = {NMR chemical shifts provide important local structural information for proteins and are key in recently described protein structure generation protocols. We describe a new chemical shift prediction program, SPARTA+, which is based on artificial neural networking. The neural network is trained on a large carefully pruned database, containing 580 proteins for which high-resolution X-ray structures and nearly complete backbone and (13)C(beta) chemical shifts are available. The neural network is trained to establish quantitative relations between chemical shifts and protein structures, including backbone and side-chain conformation, H-bonding, electric fields and ring-current effects. The trained neural network yields rapid chemical shift prediction for backbone and (13)C(beta) atoms, with standard deviations of 2.45, 1.09, 0.94, 1.14, 0.25 and 0.49 ppm for delta(15)N, delta(13)C', delta(13)C(alpha), delta(13)C(beta), delta(1)H(alpha) and delta(1)H(N), respectively, between the SPARTA+ predicted and experimental shifts for a set of eleven validation proteins. These results represent a modest but consistent improvement (2-10{\%}) over the best programs available to date, and appear to be approaching the limit at which empirical approaches can predict chemical shifts.},

abstract = {Most growth factors are initially synthesized as precursor proteins and subsequently processed into their mature form by proteolytic cleavage, resulting in simultaneous removal of a pro-peptide. However, compared with that of mature form, the biological role of the pro-peptide is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the biological role of the pro-peptide of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and first showed that the pro-peptide is expressed and secreted in hippocampal tissues and cultures, respectively. Interestingly, we found that the BDNF pro-peptide directly facilitates hippocampal long-term depression (LTD), requiring the activation of GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors and the pan-neurotrophin receptor p75(NTR). The BDNF pro-peptide also enhances NMDA-induced $\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptor endocytosis, a mechanism crucial for LTD expression. Thus, the BDNF pro-peptide is involved in synaptic plasticity that regulates a mechanism responsible for promoting LTD. The well-known BDNF polymorphism valine for methionine at amino acid position 66 (Val66Met) affects human memory function. Here, the BDNF pro-peptide with Met mutation completely inhibits hippocampal LTD. These findings demonstrate functional roles for the BDNF pro-peptide and a naturally occurring human BDNF polymorphism in hippocampal synaptic depression.},

abstract = {There is a growing interest in understanding the properties of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs); however, the characterization of these states remains an open challenge. IDPs appear to have functional roles that diverge from those of folded proteins and revolve around their ability to act as hubs for protein-protein interactions. To gain a better understanding of the modes of binding of IDPs, we combined statistical mechanics, calorimetry, and NMR spectroscopy to investigate the recognition and binding of a fragment from the disordered protein Gab2 by the growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), a key interaction for normal cell signaling and cancer development. Structural ensemble refinement by NMR chemical shifts, thermodynamics measurements, and analysis of point mutations indicated that the population of preexisting bound conformations in the free-state ensemble of Gab2 is an essential determinant for recognition and binding by Grb2. A key role was found for transient polyproline II (PPII) structures and extended conformations. Our findings are likely to have very general implications for the biological behavior of IDPs in light of the evidence that a large fraction of these proteins possess a specific propensity to form PPII and to adopt conformations that are more extended than the typical random-coil states.},

Specific non-covalent crosslinks involving domains/motifs lead to system-spanning networks referred to as gels. Gelation transitions can occur with or without phase separation. In gelation driven by phase separation multivalent proteins and their ligands condense into dense droplets, and gels form within droplets. System spanning networks can also form without a condensation or demixing of proteins into droplets. Gelation driven by phase separation requires lower protein concentrations, and seems to be the biologically preferred mechanism for forming membraneless bodies. Here, we use coarse-grained computer simulations and the theory of associative polymers to uncover the physical properties of intrinsically disordered linkers that determine the extent to which gelation of linear multivalent proteins is driven by phase separation. Our findings are relevant for understanding how sequence-encoded information in disordered linkers influences phase transitions of multivalent proteins.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The possibility that neurotrophins are also involved in processes of neuronal plasticity has only recently begun to receive attention. To determine whether BDNF has a function in processes such as long-term potentiation (LTP), we produced a strain of mice with a deletion in the coding sequence of the BDNF gene. We then used hippocampal slices from these mice to investigate whether LTP was affected by this mutation. Homo- and heterozygous mutant mice showed significantly reduced LTP in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The magnitude of the potentiation, as well as the percentage of cases in which LTP could be induced successfully, was clearly affected. According to the criteria tested, important pharmacological, anatomical, and morphological parameters in the hippocampus of these animals appear to be normal. These results suggest that BDNF might have a functional role in the expression of LTP in the hippocampus.},

We conducted a meta-analysis of studies comparing the frequency of the BDNF Val66Met-coding variant in depressed cases (MDD) and nondepressed controls. A total of 14 studies involving 2812 cases with DSM-III or -IV defined MDD and 10 843 nondepressed controls met the inclusion criteria. Analyses were stratified either by gender or ethnicity (Asian and Caucasian) because MDD is more prevalent in women and in Caucasians and because BDNF allele frequencies differ by ethnicity. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) were provided for allelic analyses (Met versus Val), as well as for genotypic analyses (Met/Met and Val/Met versus Val/Val). In the total sample, the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism was not significantly associated with depression. However, the gender stratified analyses revealed significant effects in both the allelic and genotypic analyses in men (OR(MET), 95{\%} CI; 1.27 (1.10-1.47); OR(MET/MET), 95{\%} CI; 1.67 (1.19-2.36)).

abstract = {s Abstract Comparative modeling predicts the three-dimensional structure of a given protein sequence (target) based primarily on its alignment to one or more pro-teins of known structure (templates). The prediction process consists of fold assign-ment, target–template alignment, model building, and model evaluation. The number of protein sequences that can be modeled and the accuracy of the predictions are in-creasing steadily because of the growth in the number of known protein structures and because of the improvements in the modeling software. Further advances are nec-essary in recognizing weak sequence–structure similarities, aligning sequences with structures, modeling of rigid body shifts, distortions, loops and side chains, as well as detecting errors in a model. Despite these problems, it is currently possible to model with useful accuracy significant parts of approximately one third of all known protein sequences. The use of individual comparative models in biology is already rewarding and increasingly widespread. A major new challenge for comparative modeling is the integration of it with the torrents of data from genome sequencing projects as well as from functional and structural genomics. In particular, there is a need to develop an automated, rapid, robust, sensitive, and accurate comparative modeling pipeline applicable to whole genomes. Such large-scale modeling is likely to encourage new kinds of applications for the many resulting models, based on their large number and completeness at the level of the family, organism, or functional network.},

Solving this mystery requires a first principles understanding of the quantitative relationships between information encoded in the sequences of disordered proteins and the ensemble of conformations they sample. Advances in quantifying sequence-ensemble relationships have been facilitated through a four-way synergy between bioinformatics, biophysical experiments, computer simulations and polymer physics theories.

Our results with a canonical activation domain from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factor Gcn4 reconcile existing observations into a unified model of its function: the intrinsic disorder and acidic residues keep two hydrophobic motifs from driving collapse.

These proteins have interesting structural properties that deviate from the random-coil-like behavior exhibited by chemically denatured proteins. In particular, IDPs are often observed to exhibit significant compaction. In this study, we have analyzed the hydrodynamic radii of a number of IDPs to investigate the sequence determinants of this compaction. Net charge and proline content are observed to be strongly correlated with increased hydrodynamic radii, suggesting that these are the dominant contributors to compaction. Hydrophobicity and secondary structure, on the other hand, appear to have negligible effects on compaction, which implies that the determinants of structure in folded and intrinsically disordered proteins are profoundly different. Finally, we observe that polyhistidine tags seem to increase IDP compaction, which suggests that these tags have significant perturbing effects and thus should be removed before any structural characterizations of IDPs. Using the relationships observed in this analysis, we have developed a sequence-based predictor of hydrodynamic radius for IDPs that shows substantial improvement over a simple model based upon chain length alone.},

We generated a variant BDNF mouse (BDNF(MET/Met)) that reproduces the phenotypic hallmarks in humans with the variant allele.

In this context, the BDNF(Met/Met) mouse represents a unique model that directly links altered activity-dependent release of BDNF to a defined set of in vivo consequences. Our subsequent analyses of these mice elucidated a phenotype that had not been established in human carriers: increased anxiety. When placed in conflict settings, BDNF(Met/Met) mice display increased anxiety-related behaviours that were not normalized by the antidepressant, fluoxetine.

abstract = {Extensive amounts of information about protein sequences are becoming available, as demonstrated by the over 79 million entries in the UniProt database. Yet, it is still challenging to obtain proteome-wide experimental information on the structural properties associated with these sequences. Fast computational predictors of secondary structure and of intrinsic disorder of proteins have been developed in order to bridge this gap. These two types of predictions, however, have remained largely separated, often preventing a clear characterization of the structure and dynamics of proteins. Here, we introduce a computational method to predict secondary-structure populations from amino acid sequences, which simultaneously characterizes structure and disorder in a unified statistical mechanics framework. To develop this method, called s2D, we exploited recent advances made in the analysis of NMR chemical shifts that provide quantitative information about the probability distributions of secondary-structure elements in disordered states. The results that we discuss show that the s2D method predicts secondary-structure populations with an average error of about 14{\%}. A validation on three datasets of mostly disordered, mostly structured and partly structured proteins, respectively, shows that its performance is comparable to or better than that of existing predictors of intrinsic disorder and of secondary structure. These results indicate that it is possible to perform rapid and quantitative sequence-based characterizations of the structure and dynamics of proteins through the predictions of the statistical distributions of their ordered and disordered regions.},

Intrinsic conformational disorder plays a prominent role in viral proteins and their interaction with other viral and host cell proteins via transiently populated structural elements. Here, we report on the results of an investigation of an intrinsically disordered 188-residue fragment of the hepatitis C virus non-structural protein 5A (NS5A), which contains a classical poly-proline Src homology 3 (SH3) binding motif, using sensitivity- and resolution-optimized multidimensional NMR methods, complemented by small-angle X-ray scattering data. Our study provides detailed atomic-resolution information on transient local and long-range structure, as well as fast time scale dynamics in this NS5A fragment. In addition, we could characterize two distinct interaction modes with the SH3 domain of Bin1 (bridging integrator protein 1), a pro-apoptotic tumor suppressor. Despite being largely disordered, the protein contains three regions that transiently adopt $\alpha$-helical structures, partly stabilized by long-range tertiary interactions.

abstract = {How do antidepressants elicit an antidepressant response? Here, we review accumulating evidence that the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) serves as a transducer, acting as the link between the antidepressant drug and the neuroplastic changes that result in the improvement of the depressive symptoms. Over the last decade several studies have consistently highlighted BDNF as a key player in antidepressant action. An increase in hippocampal and cortical expression of BDNF mRNA parallels the antidepressant-like response of conventional antidepressants such as SSRIs. Subsequent studies showed that a single bilateral infusion of BDNF into the ventricles or directly into the hippocampus is sufficient to induce a relatively rapid and sustained antidepressant-like effect. Importantly, the antidepressant-like response to conventional antidepressants is attenuated in mice where the BDNF signaling has been disrupted by genetic manipulations. Low dose ketamine, which has been found to induce a rapid antidepressant effect in patients with treatment-resistant depression, is also dependent on increased BDNF signaling. Ketamine transiently increases BDNF translation in hippocampus, leading to enhanced synaptic plasticity and synaptic strength. Ketamine has been shown to increase BDNF translation by blocking NMDA receptor activity at rest, thereby inhibiting calcium influx and subsequently halting eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) kinase leading to a desuppression of protein translation, including BDNF translation. The antidepressant-like response of ketamine is abolished in BDNF and TrkB conditional knockout mice, eEF2 kinase knockout mice, in mice carrying the BDNF met/met allele, and by intra-cortical infusions of BDNF-neutralizing antibodies. In summary, current data suggests that conventional antidepressants and ketamine mediate their antidepressant-like effects by increasing BDNF in forebrain regions, in particular the hippocampus, making BDNF an essential determinant of antidepressant efficacy.},

abstract = {Internal friction is an important contribution to protein dynamics at all stages along the folding reaction. Even in unfolded and intrinsically disordered proteins, internal friction has a large influence, as demon-strated with several experimental techniques and in simulations. However, these methods probe different facets of internal friction and have been applied to disparate molecular systems, raising questions regarding the compatibility of the results. To obtain an integrated view, we apply here the combination of two complemen-tary experimental techniques, simulations, and theory to the same system: unfolded protein L. We use single-molecule F{\"{o}}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) to measure the global reconfiguration dynamics of the chain, and photoinduced electron transfer (PET), a contact-based method, to quantify the rate of loop formation between two residues. This combination enables us to probe unfolded-state dynamics on dif-ferent length scales, corresponding to different parts of the intramo-lecular distance distribution. Both FRET and PET measurements show that internal friction dominates unfolded-state dynamics at low dena-turant concentration, and the results are in remarkable agreement with recent large-scale molecular dynamics simulations using a new water model. The simulations indicate that intrachain interactions and dihe-dral angle rotation correlate with the presence of internal friction, and theoretical models of polymer dynamics provide a framework for inter-relating the contribution of internal friction observed in the two types of experiments and in the simulations. The combined results thus pro-vide a coherent and quantitative picture of internal friction in unfolded proteins that could not be attained from the individual techniques. single-molecule FRET | nanosecond FCS | PET quenching | Rouse model with internal friction | intrinsically disordered proteins T he dynamics and folding of proteins are often modeled as a diffusive process on a free-energy surface (1–3). In contrast to simpler rate processes in the condensed phase (4), however, protein dynamics are often much slower than expected from solvent friction alone. This behavior indicates that solvent mol-ecules are not the only cause of friction, but that other sources (commonly referred to as " internal, " in contrast to the " external " action of the solvent) control protein relaxation (5–12). Internal friction has been reported for native-state dynamics (9) and folding kinetics, especially for proteins folding in the microsec-ond range (6, 13), but even for proteins folding in milliseconds (11), suggesting the presence of a solvent-independent frictional component in the transition-state ensemble (10, 13, 14). The simplest mechanistic explanation for internal friction in native proteins and transition states is that in these rather compact configurations, a large fraction of the protein atoms is not fully exposed to the solvent, and is therefore dominated by collisions and interactions with other parts of the protein (9), involving predominantly small-amplitude motions, where little solvent is displaced (15). It thus came as a surprise when recent experiments and simulations demonstrated that internal friction can dominate even the dynamics of unfolded and intrinsically disordered pro-teins and peptides (10, 12, 16–22), which are more expanded and accessible to solvent. In both experiments (10, 12, 16, 17) and simulations (19–21), unfolded proteins often exhibit the charac-teristic signature of internal friction: a pronounced deviation from direct proportionality of their reconfiguration times to solvent viscosity. The underlying molecular mechanisms, however, have remained unclear. Recent single-molecule experiments indicate a correlation of internal friction with chain compaction, suggestive of attractive intrachain interactions slowing dynamics (12, 23). However, the magnitude of internal friction was found to be only weakly dependent on chain segment length and bisection of an unfolded protein, pointing to a molecular origin that is rather independent of local sequence-specific effects (12). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have proven particularly important for connecting experimental observations to molecular details and for investigating protein dynamics in low-viscosity regimes that are experimentally inaccessible (19–21, 24, 25). Based on these stud-ies, different molecular contributions to internal friction have been proposed, including hydrogen bonds (19), nonnative salt bridges (14), concerted dihedral rotations involving crank-shaft motions of the polypeptide backbone (21), and differences in native-state topology (24). Deviations from direct proportionality of relaxation times and solvent viscosity can also be due to inertial effects or solvent memory in dihedral angle hopping (20, 25, 26). A way of testing our understanding of internal friction in un-folded proteins is the use of experimental data from complemen-tary techniques that probe chain dynamics on different length and time scales.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are an emerging part of structural biology that has challenged the classic paradigm of structure-function relationship. Indeed, IDPs have been associated with different physiological functions and associated with several pathologies, such as polyglutamine (polyQ) related diseases. Ataxin-3 (AT3) is the smallest polyQ protein, composed by the N-terminal folded Josephin domain (JD), which is amyloidogenic on its own, and a C-terminal unstructured part. The disordered region between the polyQ and the JD, AT3182-291 plays a key role in the development of the disease.

METHODS: We integrated different biophysical experimental techniques, atomistic explicit-solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and graph theory to study AT3182-291 structure.

RESULTS: AT3182-291 is a monomeric intrinsically disordered (ID) domain in solution and it is characterized by different conformational states, ascribable to pre-molten globule populations with different degrees of compactness. If isolated, it decreases the aggregation of the entire AT3.

CONCLUSIONS: We provided the first structural description of an ID domain associated to a polyQ protein and we also showed that it exerts protective effects against AT3 aggregation. This effect is likely to be induced by intermolecular interactions between AT3 and the ubiquitin-interacting motifs of AT3182-291. Electrostatic interactions play a pivotal role in regulating the topology and tertiary propensity of the fragment and hub residues have been identified.

GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Synergistic use of atomistic simulations and biophysical techniques should be more generally applied to the study of IDPs. Since ID domains and polyQ-proteins are intimately connected, the study here provided can be of interest for other members of the group.},

abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) access highly diverse ensembles of conformations in their functional states. Although this conformational plasticity is essential to their function, little is known about the dynamics underlying interconversion between accessible states. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation rates contain a wealth of information about the time scales and amplitudes of motion in IDPs, but the highly dynamic nature of IDPs complicates their interpretation. We present a novel framework in which a series of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used in combination with experimental 15 N relaxation measurements to characterize the ensemble of dynamic processes contributing to the observed rates. By accounting for the distinct dynamic averaging present in the different conformational states sampled by the equilibrium ensemble, we are able to accurately describe both dynamic time scales and local and global conformational sampling. The method is robust, systematically improving agreement with independent experimental relaxation data, irrespective of the actively targeted rates, and suggesting interdependence of motions occurring on time scales varying over 3 orders of magnitude. I ntrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are highly flexible in their functional state, 1−3 sampling a much flatter energy landscape than their folded counterparts and allowing interconversion between a quasi-continuum of accessible conformations.

As a member of the C/EBP family, CHOP contains a low complexity N-terminal region involved in transcriptional activation, followed by a bZIP that binds DNA after dimerization. However, in contrast to other C/EBPs, CHOP directs binding to non-canonical C/EBP sites due to unique substitutions in its DNA-binding domain. Herein, we show that the N-terminal region of CHOP is intrinsically unstructured but contains two segments presenting $\alpha$-helical propensity. One of these segments is conserved in other C/EBPs and mediates essential roles of CHOP, including regulation through phosphorylation. The second segment is placed within a proteolytic-resistant portion of the protein and exhibits reduced flexibility. Moreover, the DNA-binding region of CHOP also contains a segment with $\alpha$-helical character towards its most N-terminal part. Our results suggest that structure-prone segments scattered within disordered regions may be critical for macromolecular recognition during CHOP-mediated transcriptional activation.},
