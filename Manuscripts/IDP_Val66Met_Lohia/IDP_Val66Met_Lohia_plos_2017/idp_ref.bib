abstract = {The aggregation of amyloid $\beta$-protein (A$\beta$) has been associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. A number of single point mutations at residues A21, E22, D23, and M35 have been identified to show increased or decreased aggregation tendency. Although the effects of point mutations on the structural properties of A$\beta$ peptides have been intensively studied, how single point mutation affects the kinetics of A$\beta$ remains unknown. In this work, dihedral dynamics analyses, which combine dihedral principle component analysis (dPCA), potential of mean force (PMF) calculations, and Markov state models (MSMs), were proposed to elucidate the different global free energy landscapes (FELs), the PMF of individual dihedral angle, and microstates/macrostates for a number of A$\beta$42 mutants (Flemish A21G, Arctic E22G, Italian E22K, Dutch E22Q, Iowa D23N, Japanese E22$\Delta$, and M35 oxidation Met35OX). Our simulation results show that one point mutation is sufficient to change the rugged FEL of A$\beta$42 by altering the energy b...},

abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) often rely on electrostatic interactions to bind their structured targets. To obtain insight into the mechanism of formation of the electrostatic encounter complex, we investigated the binding of the peptide Sos (PPPVPPRRRR), which serves as a minimal model for an IDP, to the c-Crk N-terminal SH3 domain. Initially, we measured 15N relaxation rates at two magnetic field strengths and determined the binding shifts for the complex of Sos with wild-type SH3. We have also recorded a 3 $\mu$s molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory of this complex using the Amber ff99SB*-ILDN force field. The comparison of the experimental and simulated data shows that MD simulation consistently overestimates the strength of salt bridge interactions at the binding interface. The series of simulations using other advanced force fields also failed to produce any satisfactory results. To address this issue, we have devised an empirical correction to the Amber ff99SB*-ILDN force field whereby the Len...},

abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) access highly diverse ensembles of conformations in their functional states. Although this conformational plasticity is essential to their function, little is known about the dynamics underlying interconversion between accessible states. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation rates contain a wealth of information about the time scales and amplitudes of motion in IDPs, but the highly dynamic nature of IDPs complicates their interpretation. We present a novel framework in which a series of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used in combination with experimental 15 N relaxation measurements to characterize the ensemble of dynamic processes contributing to the observed rates. By accounting for the distinct dynamic averaging present in the different conformational states sampled by the equilibrium ensemble, we are able to accurately describe both dynamic time scales and local and global conformational sampling. The method is robust, systematically improving agreement with independent experimental relaxation data, irrespective of the actively targeted rates, and suggesting interdependence of motions occurring on time scales varying over 3 orders of magnitude. I ntrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are highly flexible in their functional state, 1−3 sampling a much flatter energy landscape than their folded counterparts and allowing interconversion between a quasi-continuum of accessible conformations. Their extreme conformational plasticity pro-vides them with the unique capability of acting in functional modes that are not achievable by folded proteins, such as folding-upon-binding, 4 folding into different conformations depending on binding partner, or the formation of dynamic complexes. 5},

abstract = {The synucleins are a family of intrinsically disordered proteins involved in various human diseases. alpha-Synuclein has been extensively characterized due to its role in Parkinson's disease where it forms intracellular aggregates, while gamma-synuclein is overexpressed in a majority of late-stage breast cancers. Despite fairly strong sequence similarity between the amyloid-forming regions of alpha- and gamma-synuclein, gamma-synuclein has only a weak propensity to form amyloid fibrils. We hypothesize that the different fibrillation tendencies of alpha- and gamma-synuclein may be related to differences in structural propensities. Here we have measured chemical shifts for gamma-synuclein and compared them to previously published shifts for alpha-synuclein. In order to facilitate direct comparison, we have implemented a simple new technique for re-referencing chemical shifts that we have found to be highly effective for both disordered and folded proteins. In addition, we have developed a new method that combines different chemical shifts into a single residue-specific secondary structure propensity (SSP) score. We observe significant differences between alpha- and gamma-synuclein secondary structure propensities. Most interestingly, gamma-synuclein has an increased alpha-helical propensity in the amyloid-forming region that is critical for alpha-synuclein fibrillation, suggesting that increased structural stability in this region may protect against gamma-synuclein aggregation. This comparison of residue-specific secondary structure propensities between intrinsically disordered homologs highlights the sensitivity of transient structure to sequence changes, which we suggest may have been exploited as an evolutionary mechanism for fast modulation of protein structure and, hence, function.},

abstract = {VMD is a molecular graphics program designed for the display and analysis of molecular assemblies, in particular biopolymers such as proteins and nucleic acids. VMD can simultaneously display any number of structures using a wide variety of rendering styles and coloring methods. Molecules are displayed as one or more "representations," in which each representation embodies a particular rendering method and coloring scheme for a selected subset of atoms. The atoms displayed in each representation are chosen using an extensive atom selection syntax, which includes Boolean operators and regular expressions. VMD provides a complete graphical user interface for program control, as well as a text interface using the Tcl embeddable parser to allow for complex scripts with variable substitution, control loops, and function calls. Full session logging is supported, which produces a VMD command script for later playback. High-resolution raster images of displayed molecules may be produced by generating input scripts for use by a number of photorealistic image-rendering applications. VMD has also been expressly designed with the ability to animate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories, imported either from files or from a direct connection to a running MD simulation. VMD is the visualization component of MDScope, a set of tools for interactive problem solving in structural biology, which also includes the parallel MD program NAMD, and the MDCOMM software used to connect the visualization and simulation programs. VMD is written in C++, using an object-oriented design; the program, including source code and extensive documentation, is freely available via anonymous ftp and through the World Wide Web.},

Clustering algorithms provide a means to interpret the conformational sampling of molecules during simulation by grouping trajectory snapshots into a few subgroups, or clusters, but the relationships between the individual clusters may not be readily understood. Here we show that network analysis can be used to visualize the dominant conformational states explored during simulation as well as the connectivity between them, providing a more coherent description of conformational space than traditional clustering techniques alone. We compare the results of network visualization against 11 clustering algorithms and principal component conformer plots. Several MD simulations of proteins undergoing different conformational changes demonstrate the effectiveness of networks in reaching functional conclusions.},

abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are a unique class of proteins that have no stable native structure, a feature that allows them to adopt a wide variety of extended and compact conformations that facilitate a large number of vital physiological functions. One of the most well-known IDPs is the microtubule-associated tau protein, which regulates microtubule growth in the nervous system. However, dysfunctions in tau can lead to tau oligomerization, fibril formation, and neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer's disease. Using a combination of simulations and experiments, we explore the role of osmolytes in regulating the conformation and aggregation propensities of the R2/wt peptide, a fragment of tau containing the aggregating paired helical filament (PHF6*). We show that the osmolytes urea and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) shift the population of IDP monomer structures, but that no new conformational ensembles emerge. Although urea halts aggregation, TMAO promotes the formation of compact oligomers (including helical oligomers) through a newly proposed mechanism of redistribution of water around the perimeter of the peptide. We put forth a "superposition of ensembles" hypothesis to rationalize the mechanism by which IDP structure and aggregation is regulated in the cell.},

The characterization of the TS has become a major challenge for experimental techniques and molecular simulations approaches since diffusion, recognition, and binding is coupled to folding. In this work we present atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that sample the free energy surface of the coupled folding and binding of the transcription factor c-myb to the cotranscription factor CREB binding protein (CBP).

abstract = {Background: PAGE4, an intrinsically disordered protein up-regulated in prostate cancer, binds to c-Jun and potentiates its transactivation. Results: The effects of phosphorylation on PAGE4 conformation, dynamics, and c-Jun binding were determined by NMR. Conclusion: Phosphorylation induces a more compact conformational ensemble, restricting access to the c-Jun binding site. Significance: This study may help to explain how phosphorylation of PAGE4 alters its binding to c-Jun. Prostate-associated gene 4 (PAGE4) is an intrinsically disor-dered cancer/testis antigen that is up-regulated in the fetal and diseased human prostate. Knocking down PAGE4 expression results in cell death, whereas its overexpression leads to a growth advantage of prostate cancer cells (Zeng, Y., He, Y., Yang, F., Mooney, S. M., Getzenberg, R. H., Orban, J., and Kulkarni, P. (2011) The cancer/testis antigen prostate-associ-ated gene 4 (PAGE4) is a highly intrinsically disordered protein. J. Biol. Chem. 286, 13985–13994). Phosphorylation of PAGE4 at Thr-51 is critical for potentiating c-Jun transactivation, an important factor in controlling cell growth, apoptosis, and stress response. Using NMR spectroscopy, we show that the PAGE4 polypeptide chain has local and long-range conformational preferences that are perturbed by site-specific phosphorylation at Thr-51. The population of transient turn-like structures increases upon phosphorylation in an ϳ20-residue acidic region centered on Thr-51. This central region therefore becomes more compact and more negatively charged, with increasing intramolecular contacts to basic sequence motifs near the N and C termini. Although flexibility is decreased in the central region of phospho-PAGE4, the polypeptide chain remains highly},

abstract = {The unfolded state of globular proteins is not well described by a simple statistical coil due to residual structural features, such as secondary structure or transiently formed long-range contacts. The principle of minimal frustration predicts that the unfolded ensemble is biased toward productive regions in the conformational space determined by the native structure. Transient long-range contacts, both native-like and non-native-like, have previously been shown to be present in the unfolded state of the four-helix-bundle protein acyl co-enzyme binding protein (ACBP) as seen from both perturbations in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts and structural ensembles generated from NMR paramagnetic relaxation data. To study the nature of the contacts in detail, we used paramagnetic NMR relaxation enhancements, in combination with single-point mutations, to obtain distance constraints for the acid-unfolded ensemble of ACBP. We show that, even in the acid-unfolded state, long-range contacts are specific in nature and single-point mutations affect the free-energy landscape of the unfolded protein. Using this approach, we were able to map out concerted, interconnected, and productive long-range contacts. The correlation between the native-state stability and compactness of the denatured state provides further evidence for native-like contact formation in the denatured state. Overall, these results imply that, even in the earliest stages of folding, ACBP dynamics are governed by native-like contacts on a minimally frustrated energy landscape.},

abstract = {Functional characterization of a protein sequence is one of the most frequent problems in biology. This task is usually facilitated by accurate three-dimensional (3-D) structure of the studied protein. In the absence of an experimentally determined structure, comparative or homology modeling can sometimes provide a useful 3-D model for a protein that is related to at least one known protein structure. Comparative modeling predicts the 3-D structure of a given protein sequence (target) based primarily on its alignment to one or more proteins of known structure (templates). The prediction process consists of fold assignment, target-template alignment, model building, and model evaluation. This unit describes how to calculate comparative models using the program MODELLER and discusses all four steps of comparative modeling, frequently observed errors, and some applications. Modeling lactate dehydrogenase from Trichomonas vaginalis (TvLDH) is described as an example. The download and installation of the MODELLER software is also described. Curr. Protoc.

Conicella et al., 2016, Structure 24, 1537–1549 September 6, 2016 {\textordfeminine} 2016 Elsevier Ltd. SUMMARY RNA-binding protein TDP-43 mediates essential RNA processing but forms cytoplasmic neuronal inclusions via its C-terminal domain (CTD) in amyo-trophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It remains unclear if aggregated TDP-43 is neurotoxic and if {\$}50 ALS-associated missense mutations in TDP-43 CTD pro-mote aggregation, or if loss of normal function plays a role in disease. Recent work points to the ability of related proteins to assemble into functional phase-separated ribonucleoprotein granules via their struc-turally disordered prion-like domains. Here, we pro-vide atomic details on the structure and assembly of the low-complexity CTD of TDP-43 into liquid-liquid phase-separated in vitro granules and demonstrate that ALS-associated variants disrupt interactions within granules. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, simulation, and microscopy, we find that a subregion cooperatively but transiently folds into a helix that mediates TDP-43 phase sepa-ration. ALS-associated mutations disrupt phase separation by inhibiting interaction and helical sta-bilization. Therefore, ALS-associated mutations can disrupt TDP-43 interactions, affecting function beyond encouraging aggregation.},

abstract = {For disordered proteins, the dimensions of the chain are an important property that is sensitive to environmental conditions. We have used single-molecule F{\"{o}}rster resonance energy transfer to probe the temperature-induced chain collapse of five unfolded or intrinsically disordered proteins. Because this behavior is sensitive to the details of intrachain and chain-solvent interactions, the collapse allows us to probe the physical interactions governing the dimensions of disordered proteins. We find that each of the proteins undergoes a collapse with increasing temperature, with the most hydrophobic one, $\lambda$-repressor, undergoing a reexpansion at the highest temperatures. Although such a collapse might be expected due to the temperature dependence of the classical "hydrophobic effect," remarkably we find that the largest collapse occurs for the most hydrophilic, charged sequences. Using a combination of theory and simulation, we show that this result can be rationalized in terms of the temperature-dependent solvation free energies of the constituent amino acids, with the solvation properties of the most hydrophilic residues playing a large part in determining the collapse.},

abstract = {Research of a past decade and a half leaves no doubt that complete understanding of protein functionality requires close consideration of the fact that many functional proteins do not have well-folded structures. These intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and proteins with intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs) are highly abundant in nature and play a number of crucial roles in a living cell. Their functions, which are typically associated with a wide range of intermolecular interactions where IDPs possess remarkable binding promiscuity, complement functional repertoire of ordered proteins. All this requires a close attention to the peculiarities of biophysics of these proteins. In this review, some key biophysical features of IDPs are covered. In addition to the peculiar sequence characteristics of IDPs these biophysical features include sequential, structural, and spatiotemporal heterogeneity of IDPs; their rough and relatively flat energy landscapes; their ability to undergo both induced folding and induced unfolding; the ability to interact specifically with structurally unrelated partners; the ability to gain different structures at binding to different partners; and the ability to keep essential amount of disorder even in the bound form. IDPs are also characterized by the "turned-out" response to the changes in their environment, where they gain some structure under conditions resulting in denaturation or even unfolding of ordered proteins. It is proposed that the heterogeneous spatiotemporal structure of IDPs/IDPRs can be described as a set of foldons, inducible foldons, semi-foldons, non-foldons, and unfoldons. They may lose their function when folded, and activation of some IDPs is associated with the awaking of the dormant disorder. It is possible that IDPs represent the "edge of chaos" systems which operate in a region between order and complete randomness or chaos, where the complexity is maximal.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are an emerging part of structural biology that has challenged the classic paradigm of structure-function relationship. Indeed, IDPs have been associated with different physiological functions and associated with several pathologies, such as polyglutamine (polyQ) related diseases. Ataxin-3 (AT3) is the smallest polyQ protein, composed by the N-terminal folded Josephin domain (JD), which is amyloidogenic on its own, and a C-terminal unstructured part. The disordered region between the polyQ and the JD, AT3182-291 plays a key role in the development of the disease.

METHODS: We integrated different biophysical experimental techniques, atomistic explicit-solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and graph theory to study AT3182-291 structure.

RESULTS: AT3182-291 is a monomeric intrinsically disordered (ID) domain in solution and it is characterized by different conformational states, ascribable to pre-molten globule populations with different degrees of compactness. If isolated, it decreases the aggregation of the entire AT3.

CONCLUSIONS: We provided the first structural description of an ID domain associated to a polyQ protein and we also showed that it exerts protective effects against AT3 aggregation. This effect is likely to be induced by intermolecular interactions between AT3 and the ubiquitin-interacting motifs of AT3182-291. Electrostatic interactions play a pivotal role in regulating the topology and tertiary propensity of the fragment and hub residues have been identified.

GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Synergistic use of atomistic simulations and biophysical techniques should be more generally applied to the study of IDPs. Since ID domains and polyQ-proteins are intimately connected, the study here provided can be of interest for other members of the group.},

The classifier, DISOPRED2, was used to estimate the frequency of native disorder in several representative genomes from the three kingdoms of life. Putative, long ({\textgreater}30 residue) disordered segments are found to occur in 2.0{\%} of archaean, 4.2{\%} of eubacterial and 33.0{\%} of eukaryotic proteins. The function of proteins with long predicted regions of disorder was investigated using the gene ontology annotations supplied with the Saccharomyces genome database. The analysis of the yeast proteome suggests that proteins containing disorder are often located in the cell nucleus and are involved in the regulation of transcription and cell signalling. The results also indicate that native disorder is associated with the molecular functions of kinase activity and nucleic acid binding.},

The programs are written in ANSI C and available by ftp (information: gromacs@chem.rug.nl). The functionality is based on the GROMOS (GROningen MOlecular Simulation) package (van Gunsteren and Berendsen, 1987; BIOMOS B.V., Nijenborgh 4, 9747 AG Groningen). Conversion programs between GROMOS and GROMACS formats are included. The MD program can handle rectangular periodic boundary conditions with temperature and pressure scaling. The interactions that can be handled without modification are variable non-bonded pair interactions with Coulomb and Lennard-Jones or Buckingham potentials, using a twin-range cut-off based on charge groups, and fixed bonded interactions of either harmonic or constraint type for bonds and bond angles and either periodic or cosine power series interactions for dihedral angles. Special forces can be added to groups of particles (for non-equilibrium dynamics or for position restraining) or between particles (for distance restraints). The parallelism is based on particle decomposition. Interprocessor communication is largely limited to position and force distribution over the ring once per time step. ?? 1995.},

abstract = {Protein aggregation is a commonly occurring problem in biology. Cells have evolved stress-response mechanisms to cope with problems posed by protein aggregation. Yet, these quality control mechanisms are overwhelmed by chronic aggregation-related stress and the resultant consequences of aggregation become toxic to cells. As a result, a variety of systemic and neurodegenerative diseases are associated with various aspects of protein aggregation and rational approaches to either inhibit aggregation or manipulate the pathways to aggregation might lead to an alleviation of disease phenotypes. To develop such approaches, one needs a rigorous and quantitative understanding of protein aggregation. Much work has been done in this area. However, several unanswered questions linger, and these pertain primarily to the actual mechanism of aggregation as well as to the types of inter-molecular associations and intramolecular fluctuations realized at low protein concentrations. It has been suggested that the concepts underlying protein aggregation are similar to those used to describe the aggregation of synthetic polymers. Following this suggestion, the relevant concepts of polymer aggregation are introduced. The focus is on explaining the driving forces for polymer aggregation and how these driving forces vary with chain length and solution conditions. It is widely accepted that protein aggregation is a nucleation-dependent process. This view is based mainly on the presence of long times for the accumulation of aggregates and the elimination of these lag times with "seeds". In this sense, protein aggregation is viewed as being analogous to the aggregation of colloidal particles. The theories for polymer aggregation reviewed in this work suggest an alternative mechanism for the origin of long lag times in protein aggregation. The proposed mechanism derives from the recognition that polymers have unique dynamics that distinguish them from other aggregation-prone systems such as colloidal particles.},

abstract = {There is a growing interest in understanding the properties of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs); however, the characterization of these states remains an open challenge. IDPs appear to have functional roles that diverge from those of folded proteins and revolve around their ability to act as hubs for protein-protein interactions. To gain a better understanding of the modes of binding of IDPs, we combined statistical mechanics, calorimetry, and NMR spectroscopy to investigate the recognition and binding of a fragment from the disordered protein Gab2 by the growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), a key interaction for normal cell signaling and cancer development. Structural ensemble refinement by NMR chemical shifts, thermodynamics measurements, and analysis of point mutations indicated that the population of preexisting bound conformations in the free-state ensemble of Gab2 is an essential determinant for recognition and binding by Grb2. A key role was found for transient polyproline II (PPII) structures and extended conformations. Our findings are likely to have very general implications for the biological behavior of IDPs in light of the evidence that a large fraction of these proteins possess a specific propensity to form PPII and to adopt conformations that are more extended than the typical random-coil states.},

@article{Bah2016,
abstract = {Post-translational modifications (PTMs) produce significant changes in the structural properties of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) by affecting their energy landscapes. PTMs can induce a range of effects, from local stabilization or destabi-lization of transient secondary structure to global disorder-to-order transitions, potentially driving complete state changes between intrinsically disordered and folded states or dispersed monomeric and phase-separated states. Here, we discuss diverse biological processes that are dependent on PTM regulation of IDPs. We also present recent tools for generating homogenously modified IDPs for studies of PTM-mediated IDP regulatory mechanisms. The amino acid sequences of intrinsically disordered pro-teins or protein regions (often simply referred to as IDPs) 3 determine their inability to fold into stable tertiary structures under physiological conditions and instead enable them to rap-idly interconvert between distinct conformations to mediate critical biological functions (1, 2). The amino acid compositions of IDPs range from very low complexity with little diversity in residue types to much higher sequence complexity that enables disorder-to-order transitions upon binding or post-transla-tional modifications (PTMs) (3–5). This range of sequence composition leads to heterogeneous ensembles with variable hydrodynamic properties and fluctuating secondary and terti-ary structure, with some IDPs able to self-associate in phase-separated protein-dense droplets (6 –11). Structural heteroge-neity and dynamic fluctuations endow IDPs with unique advantages over folded proteins for certain roles (12–14). IDPs expose, at least transiently, their entire primary sequence for binding, enabling multiple interactions along their polypeptide chains. This makes them hubs in protein complexes and inte-grators in signaling networks (15–19). IDPs also facilitate the multivalent interactions that drive phase separation, underly-ing cellular membraneless organelles and signaling puncta (20 –22). Due to their accessibility to modifying enzymes, IDPs are the predominant sites of PTMs, which significantly expands their functional versatility (3, 23). By changing the physicochemical properties of the primary sequence, PTMs induce a range of structural changes, from local stabilization or destabilization of transient secondary structure to more global conformational changes in disorder-to-order transitions (24, 25). As the hydro-dynamic properties of IDPs are strongly affected by electro-static effects, PTMs that change charge (e.g. phosphorylation and acetylation) can modulate compactness (9 –11). PTMs can also lead to complete state changes, between disordered and folded states (26 –28) or dispersed monomeric and phase-sep-arated states (6, 8, 22). The scope of PTM-mediated structural and dynamic changes described in recent biophysical and bio-chemical studies of IDPs is similar to those due to binding to other proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, carbohydrates, ions, cofac-tors, and other small molecules (4, 29, 30). Here we review the effects of PTMs on IDP structure and function and how such effects regulate fundamental biological processes, from PTM-mediated conformational transitions of individual IDPs to the assembly of multi-protein complexes and the formation of membraneless protein organelles. We begin by presenting the diversity of PTMs and their effects on IDP struc-ture and function and then focus on phosphorylation, one of the most common PTMs. Because the investigation of PTM effects on IDPs is often limited by the ability to generate homo-geneously modified samples, we discuss recent advances in recombinant protein expression systems and chemical synthe-sis strategies for producing modified IDP samples. These enable detailed biochemical and biophysical characterization using general methods for IDPs as well as those specific for IDPs with PTMs (4, 30, 31)},

The possibility that neurotrophins are also involved in processes of neuronal plasticity has only recently begun to receive attention. To determine whether BDNF has a function in processes such as long-term potentiation (LTP), we produced a strain of mice with a deletion in the coding sequence of the BDNF gene. We then used hippocampal slices from these mice to investigate whether LTP was affected by this mutation. Homo- and heterozygous mutant mice showed significantly reduced LTP in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The magnitude of the potentiation, as well as the percentage of cases in which LTP could be induced successfully, was clearly affected. According to the criteria tested, important pharmacological, anatomical, and morphological parameters in the hippocampus of these animals appear to be normal. These results suggest that BDNF might have a functional role in the expression of LTP in the hippocampus.},

abstract = {The small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are a virtually ubiquitous and diverse group of molecular chaperones that can bind and protect unfolding proteins from irreversible aggregation. It has been suggested that intrinsic disorder of the N-terminal arm (NTA) of sHSPs is important for substrate recognition. To investigate conformations of the NTA that could recognize substrates we performed replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations. Behavior at normal and stress temperatures of the dimeric building blocks of dodecameric HSPs from wheat (Ta16.9) and pea (Ps18.1) were compared because they display high sequence similarity, but Ps18.1 is more efficient in binding specific substrates. In our simulations, the NTAs of the dimer are flexible and dynamic; however, rather than exhibiting highly extended conformations they retain considerable $\alpha$-helical character and contacts with the conserved $\alpha$-crystallin domain (ACD). Network analysis and clustering methods reveal that there are two major conformational forms designated either "open" or "closed" based on the relative position of the two NTAs and their hydrophobic solvent accessible surface area. The equilibrium constant for the closed to open transition is significantly different for Ta16.9 and Ps18.1, with the latter showing more open conformations at elevated temperature correlated with its more effective chaperone activity. In addition, the Ps18.1 NTAs have more hydrophobic solvent accessible surface than those of Ta16.9. NTA hydrophobic patches are comparable in size to the area buried in many protein-protein interactions, which would enable sHSPs to bind early unfolding intermediates. Reduced interactions of the Ps18.1 NTAs with each other and with the ACD contribute to the differences in dynamics and hydrophobic surface area of the two sHSPs. These data support a major role for the conformational equilibrium of the NTA in substrate binding and indicate features of the NTA that contribute to sHSP chaperone efficiency.},

We used all-atom molecular dynamics simulations at microsecond time scales with the OPLS-AA force field and TIP4P explicit water model to study the structural dynamics of the monomer and dimer of H6R sequences of both peptides.

abstract = {Long-lasting forms of memory are generally believed to be mediated by protein synthesis-dependent, late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP). L-LTP exhibits at least two distinctive characteristics compared with early phase LTP (E-LTP): synaptic growth and requirement of gene transcription and new protein synthesis. In this review, we discuss the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the structural and functional changes of hippocampal synapses during L-LTP, in the context of long-term memory. We describe experiments that reveal the critical role of cAMP/protein kinase A and MAP kinase pathways, and the downstream transcription factor CREB. Because transcription-dependent long-term changes are input specific, we also discuss the role of "local protein synthesis" and "synaptic tagging" mechanisms that may confer synapse specificity. We then focus on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), two secreted proteins that have been repeatedly implicated in L-LTP. Biochemical and molecular biology experiments indicate that the expression and secretion of both factors are enhanced by strong tetanic stimulation that induces L-LTP as well as by training in hippocampal-dependent memory tasks. Inhibition of either tPA or BDNF by gene knockout and specific inhibitors results in a significant impairments in L-LTP and long-term memory. Further work will be required to address the relationship between BDNF and tPA in various forms of synaptic plasticity, and the mechanisms by which BDNF/tPA achieves synapse-specific modulation. Finally, we discuss how the aging process affects L-LTP and long-term memory.},

Recently, a variant in the human bdnf gene, resulting in a valine to methionine substitution in the prodomain, has been shown to lead to defective regulated secretion from neurons and memory impairment. Here, we report a novel function for a Vps10p domain protein, sortilin, in controlling BDNF sorting to the regulated secretory pathway. Sortilin interacts specifically with BDNF in a region encompassing the methionine substitution and colocalizes with BDNF in secretory granules in neurons. A truncated form of sortilin causes BDNF missorting to the constitutive secretory pathway without affecting neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) secretion. In addition, sortilin small interfering RNA introduced into primary neurons also led to BDNF missorting from the regulated to the constitutive secretory pathway. Together, these data suggest a mechanism to understand the defect associated with variant BDNF and provide a framework, based on divergent presynaptic regulation of sorting to secretory pathways, to explain how two ligands for tropomyosin-related kinase B, BDNF and NT-4, can mediate diverse biological responses.},

M. Science 250, 669-673]. Here, we explore the hypothesis that these measured helix-forming propensities are due primarily to conformational restrictions imposed upon residue side chains by the helix itself. This proposition is tested by calculating the extent to which the bulky helix backbone "freezes out" available degrees of free-dom in helix side chains. Specifically, for a series of apolar residues, the difference in configurational entropy, AS, be-tween each side chain in the unfolded state and in the a-helical state is obtained from a simple Monte Carlo calculation. These computed entropy differences are then compared with the experimentally determined values. Measured and calculated values are found to be in close agreement for naturally occur-ring amino acids and in total disagreement for non-natural amino acids. In the calculation, ASAIa = 0. The rank order of entropy loss for the series of natural apolar side chains under consideration is Ala {\textless} Leu {\textless} Trp {\textless} Met {\textless} Phe {\textless} Ile {\textless} Tyr {\textless} Val. Among these, none favor helix formation; Ala is neutral, and all remaining residues are unfavorable to varying degrees. Thus, applied to side chains, the term "helix prefer-ence" is a misnomer. While side chain-side chain interactions may modulate stability in some instances, our results indicate that the drive to form helices must originate in the backbone, consistent with Pauling's view of four decades ago [Pauling, L., Corey, R. B. {\&} Branson, H. R. (1951) Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. USA 37, 205-210].},

abstract = {Extensive amounts of information about protein sequences are becoming available, as demonstrated by the over 79 million entries in the UniProt database. Yet, it is still challenging to obtain proteome-wide experimental information on the structural properties associated with these sequences. Fast computational predictors of secondary structure and of intrinsic disorder of proteins have been developed in order to bridge this gap. These two types of predictions, however, have remained largely separated, often preventing a clear characterization of the structure and dynamics of proteins. Here, we introduce a computational method to predict secondary-structure populations from amino acid sequences, which simultaneously characterizes structure and disorder in a unified statistical mechanics framework. To develop this method, called s2D, we exploited recent advances made in the analysis of NMR chemical shifts that provide quantitative information about the probability distributions of secondary-structure elements in disordered states. The results that we discuss show that the s2D method predicts secondary-structure populations with an average error of about 14{\%}. A validation on three datasets of mostly disordered, mostly structured and partly structured proteins, respectively, shows that its performance is comparable to or better than that of existing predictors of intrinsic disorder and of secondary structure. These results indicate that it is possible to perform rapid and quantitative sequence-based characterizations of the structure and dynamics of proteins through the predictions of the statistical distributions of their ordered and disordered regions.},

abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are enriched in signaling and regulatory functions because disordered segments permit interaction with several proteins and hence the re-use of the same protein in multiple pathways. Understanding IDP regulation is important because altered expression of IDPs is associated with many diseases. Recent studies show that IDPs are tightly regulated and that dosage-sensitive genes encode proteins with disordered segments. The tight regulation of IDPs may contribute to signaling fidelity by ensuring that IDPs are available in appropriate amounts and not present longer than needed. The altered availability of IDPs may result in sequestration of proteins through non-functional interactions involving disordered segments (i.e., molecular titration), thereby causing an imbalance in signaling pathways. We discuss the regulation of IDPs, address implications for signaling, disease and drug development, and outline directions for future research.},

Their high degree of disorder makes them more challenging to study using the techniques of conventional structural biology, because any observable will be averaged over a heterogeneous ensemble of structures. Molecular simulations and theory are therefore a natural complement to experiment for studying the structure, dynamics and function of IDPs. The diverse time and length scales relevant to the roles played by IDPs require flexibility in the techniques applied. Here, I summarize some of the developments in simulation and theory in recent years, which have been driven by the desire to better capture IDP properties at different time- and length-scales.

The coarse-grained simulations show that small hydrophobic peptides without disordered flanks tend to aggregate under conditions where peptides embedded in unstructured peptide sequences are stable as monomers or as part of small micelle-like clusters. Surprisingly, the binding free energy of the motif is barely decreased by the presence of disordered flanking regions, although it is sensitive to the loss of entropy of the motif itself upon binding. This latter effect allows for reversible binding of the signalling motif to the substrate.

Here we show that the isolated BDNF prodomain is detected in the hippocampus and that it can be secreted from neurons in an activity-dependent manner.

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Intrinsically disordered proteins are increasingly the focus of biological research since their significance was acknowledged over a decade ago. Due to their importance in biomolecular interactions, they are found to play key roles in many diseases such as cancers and amyloidoses. However, because they lack stable structure they pose a challenge for many experimental methods that are traditionally used to study proteins. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations can help get around many of the problems faced by such methods provided appropriate timescales are sampled and underlying empirical force fields are applicable. This review presents recent works that highlight the power and potential of atomistic simulations to transform the investigatory pipeline by providing critical insights into the behavior and interactions of intrinsically disordered proteins.},

abstract = {NMR chemical shifts in proteins depend strongly on local structure. The program TALOS establishes an empirical relation between 13C, 15N and 1H chemical shifts and backbone torsion angles phi and psi (Cornilescu et al. J Biomol NMR 13 289-302, 1999). Extension of the original 20-protein database to 200 proteins increased the fraction of residues for which backbone angles could be predicted from 65 to 74{\%}, while reducing the error rate from 3 to 2.5{\%}. Addition of a two-layer neural network filter to the database fragment selection process forms the basis for a new program, TALOS+, which further enhances the prediction rate to 88.5{\%}, without increasing the error rate. Excluding the 2.5{\%} of residues for which TALOS+ makes predictions that strongly differ from those observed in the crystalline state, the accuracy of predicted phi and psi angles, equals +/-13 degrees . Large discrepancies between predictions and crystal structures are primarily limited to loop regions, and for the few cases where multiple X-ray structures are available such residues are often found in different states in the different structures. The TALOS+ output includes predictions for individual residues with missing chemical shifts, and the neural network component of the program also predicts secondary structure with good accuracy.},

Intrinsically disordered proteins do not form a fixed three-dimensional structure under physiological conditions, either in their entireties or in segments or regions. We define IDP as a protein that contains at least one experimentally determined disordered region. Although lacking fixed structure, IDPs and regions carry out important biological functions, being typically involved in regulation, signaling and control. Such functions can involve high-specificity low-affinity interactions, the multiple binding of one protein to many partners and the multiple binding of many proteins to one partner. These three features are all enabled and enhanced by protein intrinsic disorder. One of the major hindrances in the study of IDPs has been the lack of organized information. DisProt was developed to enable IDP research by collecting and organizing knowledge regarding the experimental characterization and the functional associations of IDPs. In addition to being a unique source of biological information, DisProt opens doors for a plethora of bioinformatics studies. DisProt is openly available at http://www.disprot.org.},

abstract = {Most models of protein evolution are based upon proteins that form relatively rigid 3D structures. A significant fraction of proteins, the so-called disordered proteins, do not form rigid 3D structures and sample a broad conformational ensemble. Disordered proteins do not typically maintain long-range interactions, so the constraints on their evolution should be different than ordered proteins. To test this hypothesis, we developed and compared models of evolution for disordered and ordered proteins. Substitution matrices were constructed using the sequences of putative homologs for sets of experimentally characterized disordered and ordered proteins. Separate matrices, at three levels of sequence similarity ({\textgreater}85{\%}, 85-60{\%}, and 60-40{\%}), were inferred for each type of protein structure. The substitution matrices for disordered and ordered proteins differed significantly at each level of sequence similarity. The disordered matrices reflected a greater likelihood of evolutionary changes, relative to the ordered matrices, and these changes involved nonconservative substitutions. Glutamic acid and asparagine were interesting exceptions to this result. Important differences between the substitutions that are accepted in disordered proteins relative to ordered proteins were also identified. In general, disordered proteins have fewer evolutionary constraints than ordered proteins. However, some residues like tryptophan and tyrosine are highly conserved in disordered proteins. This is due to their important role in forming protein-protein interfaces. Finally, the amino acid frequencies for disordered proteins, computed during the development of the matrices, were compared with amino acid frequencies for different categories of secondary structure in ordered proteins. The highest correlations were observed between the amino acid frequencies in disordered proteins and the solvent-exposed loops and turns of ordered proteins, supporting an emerging structural model for disordered proteins.},

Putative, long ({\textgreater}30 residue) disordered segments are found to occur in 2.0{\%} of archaean, 4.2{\%} of eubacterial and 33.0{\%} of eukaryotic proteins. The function of proteins with long predicted regions of disorder was investigated using the gene ontology annotations supplied with the Saccharomyces genome database.

Atomic-level details of this host-pathogen interaction, which involves mobile variable loops of the SPRY domain, remain unclear. Some of the key determinants of restriction are encompassed by the long and disordered v1 loop of the SPRY domain. We applied molecular modeling to elucidate the conformational repertoire of the v1 loop and its role in the interaction with the capsid. All-atom replica exchange molecular dynamics revealed multiple transient, interconverting states of the v1 loop consistent with the intrinsic disorder observed experimentally. The docking of the SPRY conformations representing 10 most populated states onto the high-resolution model of the assembled HIV-1 capsid revealed that a subset of v1 conformations produced plausible binding poses, in which the SPRY domain binds close to the pseudo-2-fold symmetry axis and the v1 loop spans the interhexamer gap. Such binding mode is well supported by the NMR binding data and known escape mutants. We speculate that the binding mode that involves interaction of the capsid with a subset of preexisting SPRY conformations arising from the intrinsic disorder of the v1 loop may explain the remarkable ability of TRIM5$\alpha$ to resist viral evasion by mutagenesis and to restrict divergent retroviruses.},

However, genetic association studies of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism (single nucleotide polymorphism rs6265) in major depressive disorder (MDD) have produced inconsistent results. We conducted a meta-analysis of studies comparing the frequency of the BDNF Val66Met-coding variant in depressed cases (MDD) and nondepressed controls. A total of 14 studies involving 2812 cases with DSM-III or -IV defined MDD and 10 843 nondepressed controls met the inclusion criteria. Analyses were stratified either by gender or ethnicity (Asian and Caucasian) because MDD is more prevalent in women and in Caucasians and because BDNF allele frequencies differ by ethnicity. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) were provided for allelic analyses (Met versus Val), as well as for genotypic analyses (Met/Met and Val/Met versus Val/Val). In the total sample, the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism was not significantly associated with depression. However, the gender stratified analyses revealed significant effects in both the allelic and genotypic analyses in men (OR(MET), 95{\%} CI; 1.27 (1.10-1.47); OR(MET/MET), 95{\%} CI; 1.67 (1.19-2.36)). Stratification according to ethnicity did not show significant effects of the Val66Met polymorphism on MDD. Our results suggest that the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism is of greater importance in the development of MDD in men than in women. Future research into gender issues will be of interest.},

Here, we study the applicability of several state-of-the-art MD force fields, of the AMBER and GROMOS variety, for the simulation of Histatin 5, a short (24 residues) cationic salivary IDP with antimicrobial and antifungal properties. The quality of the simulations is assessed in three complementary analyses: (i) protein shape and size comparison with recent experimental small-angle X-ray scattering data; (ii) secondary structure prediction; (iii) energy landscape exploration and conformational class analysis. Our results show that, indeed, standard force fields sample conformations that are too compact, being systematically unable to reproduce experimental evidence such as the scattering function, the shape of the protein as compared with the Kratky plot, and intrapeptide distances obtained through the pair distance distribution function, p(r). The consistency of this deviation suggests that the problem is not mainly due to protein− protein or water−water interactions, whose parametrization varies the most between force fields and water models. In fact, as originally proposed in [Best et al. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2014, 10, 5113−5124.], balanced protein−water interactions may be the key to solving this problem.

abstract = {An atomic resolution characterization of the structural properties of unfolded proteins that explicitly invokes the highly dynamic nature of the unfolded state will be extremely important for the development of a quantitative understanding of the thermodynamic basis of protein folding and stability. Here we develop a novel approach using residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) from unfolded proteins to determine conformational behavior on an amino acid specific basis. Conformational sampling is described in terms of ensembles of structures selected from a large pool of conformers. We test this approach, using extensive simulation, to determine how well the fitting of RDCs to reduced conformational ensembles containing few copies of the molecule can correctly reproduce the backbone conformational behavior of the protein. Having established approaches that allow accurate mapping of backbone dihedral angle conformational space from RDCs, we apply these methods to obtain an amino acid specific description of ubiquitin denatured in 8 M urea at pH 2.5. Cross-validation of data not employed in the fit verifies that an ensemble size of 200 structures is appropriate to characterize the highly fluctuating backbone. This approach allows us to identify local conformational sampling properties of urea-unfolded ubiquitin, which shows that the backbone sampling of certain types of charged or polar amino acids, in particular threonine, glutamic acid, and arginine, is affected more strongly by urea binding than amino acids with hydrophobic side chains. In general, the approach presented here establishes robust procedures for the study of all denatured and intrinsically disordered states.},

abstract = {Background: Prediction of 3-dimensional protein structures from amino acid sequences represents one of the most important problems in computational structural biology. The community-wide Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) experiments have been designed to obtain an objective assessment of the state-of-the-art of the field, where I-TASSER was ranked as the best method in the server section of the recent 7th CASP experiment. Our laboratory has since then received numerous requests about the public availability of the I-TASSER algorithm and the usage of the I-TASSER predictions. Results: An on-line version of I-TASSER is developed at the KU Center for Bioinformatics which has generated protein structure predictions for thousands of modeling requests from more than 35 countries. A scoring function (C-score) based on the relative clustering structural density and the consensus significance score of multiple threading templates is introduced to estimate the accuracy of the I-TASSER predictions. A large-scale benchmark test demonstrates a strong correlation between the C-score and the TM-score (a structural similarity measurement with values in [0, 1]) of the first models with a correlation coefficient of 0.91. Using a C-score cutoff {\textgreater} -1.5 for the models of correct topology, both false positive and false negative rates are below 0.1. Combining C-score and protein length, the accuracy of the I-TASSER models can be predicted with an average error of 0.08 for TM-score and 2 {\AA} for RMSD. Conclusion: The I-TASSER server has been developed to generate automated full-length 3D protein structural predictions where the benchmarked scoring system helps users to obtain quantitative assessments of the I-TASSER models. The output of the I-TASSER server for each query includes up to five full-length models, the confidence score, the estimated TM-score and RMSD, and the standard deviation of the estimations. The I-TASSER server is freely available to the academic community at http://zhang.bioinformatics.ku.edu/I-TASSER.},

abstract = {One of the major open challenges in structural biology is to achieve effective descriptions of disordered states of proteins. This problem is difficult because these states are conformationally highly heterogeneous and cannot be represented as single structures, and therefore it is necessary to characterize their conformational properties in terms of probability distributions. Here we show that it is possible to obtain highly quantitative information about particularly important types of probability distributions, the populations of secondary structure elements ($\alpha$-helix, $\beta$-strand, random coil, and polyproline II), by using the information provided by backbone chemical shifts. The application of this approach to mammalian prions indicates that for these proteins a key role in molecular recognition is played by disordered regions characterized by highly conserved polyproline II populations.

abstract = {A common single-nucleotide polymorphism in the human brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene, a methionine (Met) substitution for valine (Val) at codon 66 (Val66Met), is associated with alterations in brain anatomy and memory, but its relevance to clinical disorders is unclear. We generated a variant BDNF mouse (BDNF(MET/Met)) that reproduces the phenotypic hallmarks in humans with the variant allele. Variant BDNF(Met) was expressed in brain at normal levels, but its secretion from neurons was defective. In this context, the BDNF(Met/Met) mouse represents a unique model that directly links altered activity-dependent release of BDNF to a defined set of in vivo consequences. Our subsequent analyses of these mice elucidated a phenotype that had not been established in human carriers: increased anxiety. When placed in conflict settings, BDNF(Met/Met) mice display increased anxiety-related behaviours that were not normalized by the antidepressant, fluoxetine. A genetic variant BDNF may thus play a key role in genetic predispositions to anxiety and depressive disorders.},

Together, these in vitro studies with BDNFMet point to the presence of a specific trafficking signal in the BDNF prodomain region encompassing the Met substitution that is required for efficient BDNF sorting.


In studies of brain morphometry using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, Val/Met individuals have repeatedly been shown to have a smaller hippocampal volume relative to controls who are homozygous for Val allele (Val/Val) (Pezawas et al 2004, Szeszko et al 2005, Bueller et al 2006, Frodl et al 2007). 



In addition, when expressed together in the samecell, BDNFMet alters the trafficking of wild-type BDNF (BDNFVal) through the formation of heterodimers that are less efficiently sorted into the regulated secretory pathway (Chen et al 2004).

abstract = {Collapse of unfolded protein chains is an early event in folding. It affects structural properties of intrinsically disordered proteins, which take a considerable fraction of the human proteome. Collapse is generally believed to be driven by hydrophobic forces imposed by the presence of nonpolar amino acid side chains. Contributions from backbone hydrogen bonds to protein folding and stability, however, are controversial. To date, the experimental dissection of side-chain and backbone contributions has not yet been achieved because both types of interactions are integral parts of protein structure. Here, we realized this goal by applying mutagenesis and chemical modification on a set of disordered peptides and proteins. We measured the protein dimensions and kinetics of intra-chain diffusion of modified polypeptides at the level of individual molecules using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, thereby avoiding artifacts commonly caused by aggregation of unfolded protein material in bulk. We found no contributions from side chains to collapse but, instead, identified backbone interactions as a source sufficient to form globules of native-like dimensions. The presence of backbone hydrogen bonds decreased polypeptide water solubility dramatically and accelerated the nanosecond kinetics of loop closure, in agreement with recent predictions from computer simulation. The presence of side chains, instead, slowed loop closure and modulated the dimensions of intrinsically disordered domains. It appeared that the transient formation of backbone interactions facilitates the diffusive search for productive conformations at the early stage of folding and within intrinsically disordered proteins.},

Conicella et al., 2016, Structure 24, 1537–1549 September 6, 2016 {\textordfeminine} 2016 Elsevier Ltd. SUMMARY RNA-binding protein TDP-43 mediates essential RNA processing but forms cytoplasmic neuronal inclusions via its C-terminal domain (CTD) in amyo-trophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It remains unclear if aggregated TDP-43 is neurotoxic and if {\$}50 ALS-associated missense mutations in TDP-43 CTD pro-mote aggregation, or if loss of normal function plays a role in disease. Recent work points to the ability of related proteins to assemble into functional phase-separated ribonucleoprotein granules via their struc-turally disordered prion-like domains. Here, we pro-vide atomic details on the structure and assembly of the low-complexity CTD of TDP-43 into liquid-liquid phase-separated in vitro granules and demonstrate that ALS-associated variants disrupt interactions within granules. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, simulation, and microscopy, we find that a subregion cooperatively but transiently folds into a helix that mediates TDP-43 phase sepa-ration. ALS-associated mutations disrupt phase separation by inhibiting interaction and helical sta-bilization. Therefore, ALS-associated mutations can disrupt TDP-43 interactions, affecting function beyond encouraging aggregation.},

abstract = {The effects of disease mutations on protein structure and function have been extensively investigated, and many predictors of the functional impact of single amino acid substitutions are publicly available. The majority of these predictors are based on protein structure and evolutionary conservation, following the assumption that disease mutations predominantly affect folded and conserved protein regions. However, the prevalence of the intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and regions (IDRs) in the human proteome together with their lack of fixed structure and low sequence conservation raise a question about the impact of disease mutations in IDRs. Here, we investigate annotated missense disease mutations and show that 21.7{\%} of them are located within such intrinsically disordered regions. We further demonstrate that 20{\%} of disease mutations in IDRs cause local disorder-to-order transitions, which represents a 1.7-2.7 fold increase compared to annotated polymorphisms and neutral evolutionary substitutions, respectively. Secondary structure predictions show elevated rates of transition from helices and strands into loops and vice versa in the disease mutations dataset. Disease disorder-to-order mutations also influence predicted molecular recognition features (MoRFs) more often than the control mutations. The repertoire of disorder-to-order transition mutations is limited, with five most frequent mutations (R→W, R→C, E→K, R→H, R→Q) collectively accounting for 44{\%} of all deleterious disorder-to-order transitions. As a proof of concept, we performed accelerated molecular dynamics simulations on a deleterious disorder-to-order transition mutation of tumor protein p63 and, in agreement with our predictions, observed an increased $\alpha$-helical propensity of the region harboring the mutation. Our findings highlight the importance of mutations in IDRs and refine the traditional structure-centric view of disease mutations. The results of this study offer a new perspective on the role of mutations in disease, with implications for improving predictors of the functional impact of missense mutations.},

abstract = {Understanding protein folding is one of the most challenging problems remaining in molecular biology. In this chapter, a highly parallel replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) method and its application to protein folding are described. The REMD method couples molecular dynamics trajectories with a temperature exchange Monte Carlo process for efficient sampling of the conformational space. A series of replicas are run in parallel at temperatures ranging from the desired temperature to a high temperature at which the replica can easily surmount the energy barriers. From time to time the configurations of neighboring replicas are exchanged and this exchange is accepted or rejected based on a Metropolis acceptance criterion that guarantees the detailed balance. Two example protein systems, one alpha-helix and one beta-hairpin, are used as case studies to demonstrate the power of the algorithm. Up to 64 replicas of solvated protein systems are simulated in parallel over a wide range of temperatures. The simulation results show that the combined trajectories in temperature and configurational space allow a replica to overcome free energy barriers present at low temperatures. These large-scale simulations also reveal detailed results on folding mechanisms, intermediate state structures, thermodynamic properties, and the temperature dependences for both protein systems.},

@article{Das2013a,
abstract = {The functions of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are governed by relationships between information encoded in their amino acid sequences and the ensembles of conformations that they sample as autonomous units. Most IDPs are polyampholytes, with sequences that include both positively and negatively charged residues. Accordingly, we focus here on the sequence-ensemble relationships of polyampholytic IDPs. The fraction of charged residues discriminates between weak and strong polyampholytes. Using atomistic simulations, we show that weak polyampholytes form globules, whereas the conformational preferences of strong polyampholytes are determined by a combination of fraction of charged residues values and the linear sequence distributions of oppositely charged residues. We quantify the latter using a patterning parameter $\kappa$ that lies between zero and one. The value of $\kappa$ is low for well-mixed sequences, and in these sequences, intrachain electrostatic repulsions and attractions are counterbalanced, leading to the unmasking of preferences for conformations that resemble either self-avoiding random walks or generic Flory random coils. Segregation of oppositely charged residues within linear sequences leads to high $\kappa$-values and preferences for hairpin-like conformations caused by long-range electrostatic attractions induced by conformational fluctuations. We propose a scaling theory to explain the sequence-encoded conformational properties of strong polyampholytes. We show that naturally occurring strong polyampholytes have low $\kappa$-values, and this feature implies a selection for random coil ensembles. The design of sequences with different $\kappa$-values demonstrably alters the conformational preferences of polyampholytic IDPs, and this ability could become a useful tool for enabling direct inquiries into connections between sequence-ensemble relationships and functions of IDPs.},

abstract = {s Abstract Comparative modeling predicts the three-dimensional structure of a given protein sequence (target) based primarily on its alignment to one or more pro-teins of known structure (templates). The prediction process consists of fold assign-ment, target–template alignment, model building, and model evaluation. The number of protein sequences that can be modeled and the accuracy of the predictions are in-creasing steadily because of the growth in the number of known protein structures and because of the improvements in the modeling software. Further advances are nec-essary in recognizing weak sequence–structure similarities, aligning sequences with structures, modeling of rigid body shifts, distortions, loops and side chains, as well as detecting errors in a model. Despite these problems, it is currently possible to model with useful accuracy significant parts of approximately one third of all known protein sequences. The use of individual comparative models in biology is already rewarding and increasingly widespread. A major new challenge for comparative modeling is the integration of it with the torrents of data from genome sequencing projects as well as from functional and structural genomics. In particular, there is a need to develop an automated, rapid, robust, sensitive, and accurate comparative modeling pipeline applicable to whole genomes. Such large-scale modeling is likely to encourage new kinds of applications for the many resulting models, based on their large number and completeness at the level of the family, organism, or functional network.},

abstract = {The synucleins are a family of intrinsically disordered proteins involved in various human diseases. alpha-Synuclein has been extensively characterized due to its role in Parkinson's disease where it forms intracellular aggregates, while gamma-synuclein is overexpressed in a majority of late-stage breast cancers. Despite fairly strong sequence similarity between the amyloid-forming regions of alpha- and gamma-synuclein, gamma-synuclein has only a weak propensity to form amyloid fibrils. We hypothesize that the different fibrillation tendencies of alpha- and gamma-synuclein may be related to differences in structural propensities. Here we have measured chemical shifts for gamma-synuclein and compared them to previously published shifts for alpha-synuclein. In order to facilitate direct comparison, we have implemented a simple new technique for re-referencing chemical shifts that we have found to be highly effective for both disordered and folded proteins. In addition, we have developed a new method that combines different chemical shifts into a single residue-specific secondary structure propensity (SSP) score. We observe significant differences between alpha- and gamma-synuclein secondary structure propensities. Most interestingly, gamma-synuclein has an increased alpha-helical propensity in the amyloid-forming region that is critical for alpha-synuclein fibrillation, suggesting that increased structural stability in this region may protect against gamma-synuclein aggregation. This comparison of residue-specific secondary structure propensities between intrinsically disordered homologs highlights the sensitivity of transient structure to sequence changes, which we suggest may have been exploited as an evolutionary mechanism for fast modulation of protein structure and, hence, function.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND There is an increasing recognition that the pathophysiology of mental disorders could be the result of deregulation of synaptic plasticity with alterations of neurotrophins. The valine (Val)66-to-methionine (Met) variant, located in the pro brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) sequence, has been extensively studied through linkage and association approaches in several psychiatric disorders. METHODS We performed a meta-analysis restricted to individual case-control studies in different categories of mental disorders and BDNF Val66Met polymorphism. We included data from 39 case-control studies encompassing psychiatric phenotypes: eating disorders, substance-related disorders, mood disorders, and schizophrenia, among others. RESULTS The association of Val66Met was confined to three diagnoses: substance-related disorders, eating disorders, and schizophrenia. The Val/Met and the Met/Met genotypes increase the risk for eating disorders up to 33{\%}, while these same genotypes confer a 21{\%} protective effect in substance-related disorders. The homozygous carriers Met/Met showed a 19{\%} increased risk of schizophrenia with respect to the heterozygous state. CONCLUSIONS The study confirms the association of Val66Met to substance-related disorders, eating disorders, and schizophrenia. It remains to be determined if other variants in tight linkage disequilibrium with Val66Met could configure an extended functional haplotype that would explain observed discrepancies in risk estimations across studies.},
