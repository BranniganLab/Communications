  abstract = { The classical studies of nicotine by Langley at the turn of the 20\textsuperscript{th} century introduced the concept of a “receptive substance,” from which the idea of a “receptor” came to light. Subsequent studies aided by the Torpedo electric organ, a rich source of muscle-type nicotinic receptors (nAChRs), and the discovery of α-bungarotoxin, a snake toxin that binds pseudo-irreversibly to the muscle nAChR, resulted in the muscle nAChR being the best characterized ligand-gated ion channel hitherto. With the advancement of functional and genetic studies in the late 1980s, the existence of nAChRs in the mammalian brain was confirmed and the realization that the numerous nAChR subtypes contribute to the psychoactive properties of nicotine and other drugs of abuse and to the neuropathology of various diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and schizophrenia, has since emerged. This review provides a comprehensive overview of these findings and the more recent revelations of the impact that the rich diversity in function and expression of this receptor family has on neuronal and nonneuronal cells throughout the body. Despite these numerous developments, our understanding of the contributions of specific neuronal nAChR subtypes to the many facets of physiology throughout the body remains in its infancy. },

  abstract  = {The structural and functional properties of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR), the archetype molecule in the superfamily of Cys-looped ligand-gated ion channels, are strongly dependent on the lipids in the vicinal microenvironment. The influence on receptor properties is mainly exerted by the AChR-vicinal ("shell" or "annular") lipids, which occur in the liquid-ordered phase as opposed to the more disordered and "fluid" bulk membrane lipids. Fluorescence studies from our laboratory have identified discrete sites for fatty acids, phospholipids, and cholesterol on the AChR protein, and electron-spin resonance spectroscopy has enabled the establishment of the stoichiometry and selectivity of the shell lipid for the AChR and the disclosure of lipid sites in the AChR transmembrane region. Experimental evidence supports the notion that the interface between the protein moiety and the adjacent lipid shell is the locus of a variety of pharmacologically relevant processes, including the action of steroids and other lipids. I surmise that the outermost ring of M4 helices constitutes the boundary interface, most suitable to convey the signals from the lipid microenvironment to the rest of the transmembrane region, and to the channel inner ring in particular.},

  abstract        = {Cholesterol is a potent modulator of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) from Torpedo. Here, we review current understanding of the mechanisms underlying cholesterol-nAChR interactions in the context of increasingly available high-resolution structural and functional data. Cholesterol and other lipids influence function by conformational selection and kinetic mechanisms, stabilizing varying proportions of activatable vs nonactivatable conformations, as well as influencing the rates of transitions between conformational states. In the absence of cholesterol and anionic lipids, the nAChR adopts an uncoupled conformation that binds agonist but does not undergo agonist-induced conformational transitions-unless the nAChR is located in a relatively thick lipid bilayer, such as that found in cholesterol-rich lipid rafts. We highlight different sites of cholesterol action, including the lipid-exposed M4 transmembrane α-helix. Cholesterol and other lipids likely alter function by modulating interactions between M4 and the adjacent transmembrane α-helices, M1 and M3. These same interactions have been implicated in both the folding and trafficking of nAChRs to the cell surface. We evaluate the nature of cholesterol-nAChR interactions, considering the evidence supporting the roles of both direct binding to allosteric sites and cholesterol-induced changes in bulk membrane physical properties.},

Synapses have lipid compositions distinct from the rest of the cell membrane, suggesting that neurotransmitter receptors and their scaffolding and adaptor protein partners require specific lipid habitats for optimal operation. In this review we discuss some paradigmatic cases of neurotransmitter receptor-lipid interactions, highlighting the chemical nature of the intervening lipid species and providing examples of the receptor mechanisms affected by interaction with lipids. The focus is on the effects of cholesterol, glycerophospholipids and covalent fatty acid acylation on neurotransmitter receptors. We also briefly discuss the role of lipid phase states involving lateral heterogeneities of the host membrane known to modulate membrane transport, protein sorting and signaling. Modulation of neurotransmitter receptors by lipids occurs at multiple levels, affecting a wide span of activities including their trafficking, sorting, stability, residence lifetime at the cell surface, endocytosis, and recycling, among other important functional properties at the synapse.},

  journal  = {Journal of Neuroinflammation},
  year     = {2017},
  volume   = {14},
  abstract = {Background: α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are widely distributed throughout the central nervous system and are reported to have neuroprotective properties. α7 nAChRs are expressed on astrocytes, which are key regulators of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in several neurodegenerative diseases. However, the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of astroglial α7 nAChRs are not well studied. Therefore, we evaluated the role of astroglial α7 nAChR activation in neuroinflammation. Methods: Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of α7 nAChR activation were evaluated in an in vitro mouse model of neuroinflammation using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in primary astrocyte cultures. α7 nAChR anti-inflammatory effects on the NF-κB pathway were evaluated using ELISA, gene expression analysis, immunofluorescence, and western blotting. Antioxidant effect of α7 nAChR activation on expression profiles of canonical Nrf2 target genes was examined by quantitative PCR and western blotting. The role of the Nrf2 pathway in α7 nAChR-mediated anti-inflammatory response was evaluated using Nrf2 knockout astrocytes. Brain ex vivo NF-κB luciferase signals were evaluated after treatment with an α7 nAChR agonist in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-injected NF-κB luciferase reporter mouse model. Results: Astrocytes treated with the α7 nAChR partial agonist (GTS21) showed significantly reduced LPS-mediated secretion of inflammatory cytokines and this effect was reversed by the α7 nAChR antagonist methyllycaconitine (MLA) and by knockdown of α7 nAChR expression with a short hairpin RNA. Further, α7 nAChR activation blocked LPS-mediated NF-κB nuclear translocation indicating that the observed anti-inflammatory effect may be mediated through inhibition of the NF-κB pathway. Treatment with GTS21 also upregulated canonical Nrf2 antioxidant genes and proteins suggesting antioxidant properties of α7 nAChR in astrocytes. Using an astrocyte conditioned media approach, we demonstrated reduction in neuronal apoptosis when astrocytes were pretreated with GTS21. Finally, in an in vivo neuroinflammation model using LPS in NF-κB luciferase reporter mice, we demonstrated reduction in LPS-induced NF-κB activity and pro-inflammatory cytokines with GTS21 treatment in brain tissue. Conclusion: Our results suggest that activating astroglial α7 nAChRs may have a role in neuroprotection by decreasing inflammation and oxidative stress, and therefore could have therapeutic implication for disease modifying treatments of neurodegenerative diseases.},

However, little is known about the potential and mechanism of glycinergic cannabinoids for chronic pain treatment. We report that systemic and intrathecal administration of cannabidiol (CBD), a major nonpsychoactive component of marijuana, and its modified derivatives significantly suppress chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain without causing apparent analgesic tolerance in rodents. The cannabinoids significantly potentiate glycine currents in dorsal horn neurons in rat spinal cord slices. The analgesic potency of 11 structurally similar cannabinoids is positively correlated with cannabinoid potentiation of the α3 GlyRs. In contrast, the cannabinoid analgesia is neither correlated with their binding affinity for CB1 and CB2 receptors nor with their psychoactive side effects. NMR analysis reveals a direct interaction between CBD and S296 in the third transmembrane domain of purified α3 GlyR. The cannabinoid-induced analgesic effect is absent in mice lacking the α3 GlyRs. Our findings suggest that the α3 GlyRs mediate glycinergic cannabinoid-induced suppression of chronic pain. These cannabinoids may represent a novel class of therapeutic agents for the treatment of chronic pain and other diseases involving GlyR dysfunction.},

  abstract    = {Cys-loop receptors are neurotransmitter-gated ion channels that are essential mediators of fast chemical neurotransmission and are associated with a large number of neurological diseases and disorders, as well as parasitic infections. Members of this ion channel superfamily mediate excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmission depending on their ligand and ion selectivity. Structural information for Cys-loop receptors comes from several sources including electron microscopic studies of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, high-resolution X-ray structures of extracellular domains and X-ray structures of bacterial orthologues. In 2011 our group published structures of the Caenorhabditis elegans glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl) in complex with the allosteric partial agonist ivermectin, which provided insights into the structure of a possibly open state of a eukaryotic Cys-loop receptor, the basis for anion selectivity and channel block, and the mechanism by which ivermectin and related molecules stabilize the open state and potentiate neurotransmitter binding. However, there remain unanswered questions about the mechanism of channel opening and closing, the location and nature of the shut ion channel gate, the transitions between the closed/resting, open/activated and closed/desensitized states, and the mechanism by which conformational changes are coupled between the extracellular, orthosteric agonist binding domain and the transmembrane, ion channel domain. Here we present two conformationally distinct structures of C. elegans GluCl in the absence of ivermectin. Structural comparisons reveal a quaternary activation mechanism arising from rigid-body movements between the extracellular and transmembrane domains and a mechanism for modulation of the receptor by phospholipids.},

We find that the membrane-induced interaction between inclusions varies nonmonotonically as a function of the inclusion spacing. The location of the energy minimum depends on the spontaneous curvature and the membrane perturbation decay length, where the latter is set by the membrane moduli. The membrane perturbation energy increases with the inclusion radius. The Ornstein-Zernike theory, with the Percus-Yevick closure, is used to calculate the radial distribution function of inclusions. We find that when the spontaneous curvature is zero, the interaction between inclusions due to the membrane deformation is qualitatively similar to the hard-core interaction. However, in the case of finite spontaneous curvature, the effective interaction is dramatically modified.},

The active site of this family of proteins is their ion channel pore, which is located at the center of the transmembrane domain. The opening/closing motions of the channel pore are governed by the binding of neurotransmitter to the extracellular domain, but also by allosteric effectors acting within the transmembrane domain. Here, we review the structure of the transmembrane domain as well as its role in the allosteric modulation of pentameric ligand-gated ion channel function. We focus on two examples: the interactions of nicotinic ACh receptors with lipids, for which a novel “uncoupled” state has been proposed, and the interactions of GABAA and Glycine receptors with allosteric modulators, such as general anesthetics, ethanol and neurosteroids. We revisit these data in light of the recently solved X-ray structures of bacterial members of the family, which provide atomic-resolution insight into the structures of both the transmembrane domain and associated lipids.},

Concentration levels of lipids enriched in the brain evolve approximately four times faster among primates compared with lipids characteristic of non-neural tissues and show further acceleration of change in human neocortical regions but not in the cerebellum. Human-specific concentration changes are supported by human-specific expression changes for corresponding enzymes.

Analysis of the gangliosides by thin-layer chromatography showed that there was no selective enrichment of any individual type in the plasma membranes in relation to total brain. The major phospholipids were ethanolamine (34.2%), choline (41.6%) and serine (13.2%) phosphoglycerides. Inositol monophosphoglyceride (3.5%), sphingomyelin (5.1%) and lysolecithin (1.0%) were relatively minor components while phosphatidylglycerol was not present. Each phospholipid class showed a specific fatty acid composition which differed from that of the other phospholipids. This result extends the specific fatty acid compositions observed in grey matter and certain sub-fractions by other workers. In particular, choline phosphoglycerides contained high levels of saturated fatty acids while large quantities of docosahexaenoic acid were present in ethanolamine and serine phosphoglycerides.},

  abstract  = {Calcium-permeable neurotransmitter receptors are concentrated into structurally and biochemically isolated cellular compartments to localize calcium-mediated events during neurotransmission. The cytoplasmic membrane contains lipid microdomains called lipid rafts, which can gather into microscopically visible clusters, and thus the association of a particular protein with lipid rafts can result in its redistribution on the cell surface. The present study asks whether lipid rafts participate in the formation and maintenance of the calcium-permeable alpha7-subunit nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7nAChR) clusters found in somatic spines of ciliary neurons. Lipid rafts and alpha7nAChR become progressively colocalized within somatic spines during synaptogenesis. To determine whether these rafts are required for the maintenance of alpha7nAChR aggregates, cholesterol was extracted from dissociated ciliary neurons by treatment with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin. This treatment caused the dispersion of lipid rafts and the redistribution of alpha7nAChR into small clusters over the cell surface, suggesting that the integrity of lipid rafts is required to maintain the receptor clustering. However, lipid raft dispersion also caused the depolymerization of the F-actin cytoskeleton, which can also tether the receptor at specific sites. To assess whether interaction between rafts and alpha7nAChR is independent of F-actin filaments, the lipid raft patches were stabilized with a combination of the cholera toxin B subunit (CTX), which specifically binds to the raft component ganglioside GM1, and an antibody against CTX. The stabilized rafts were then treated with latrunculin-A to depolymerize F-actin. Under these conditions, large patches of CTX persisted and were colocalized with alpha7nAChR, indicating that the aggregates of receptors can be maintained independently of the underlying F-actin cytoskeleton. Moreover, it was found that the alpha7nAChR is resistant to detergent extraction at 4 degrees C and floats with the caveolin-containing lipid-rich fraction during density gradient centrifugation, properties that are consistent with a direct association between the receptor and the membrane microdomains.},

Most important, cholesterol may stabilize receptors in defined conformations related to their biological functions. This may occur by direct molecular interaction between cholesterol and receptors.

  abstract = {Cholesterol modulates the plasmalemma?s biophysical properties and influences the function and trafficking of membrane proteins. A fundamental phenomenon that remains obscure is how the plasmalemma?s lipid composition regulates the activatable pool of membrane receptors. An outstanding model to study this phenomenon is the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), since the nAChR activatable pool has been estimated to be but a small fraction of the receptors present in the plasmalemma. Studies on cholesterol depletion in the function of the Torpedo californica nAChR, using the lipid-exposed nAChR mutation (alphaC418W) that produces a congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS), demonstrated that cholesterol depletion causes a remarkable increase in the alphaC418W nAChR?s macroscopic current whereas not in the wild-type (WT). A variety of approaches were used to define the mechanism responsible for the cholesterol depletion mediated-increase in the alphaC418W nAChR?s macroscopic current. The present study suggests that a substantial fraction of the alphaC418W nAChRs is located in caveolin-1-positive domains, ?trapped? in a non-activatable state, and that membrane cholesterol depletion results in the relocation of these receptors to the activatable pool. Co-fractionation and co-immunoprecipitation of the alphaC418W nAChR and the membrane raft protein caveolin-1 (cav1) support the notion that interactions at lipid-exposed domains regulate the partition of the receptor into membrane raft microdomains. These results have potential implications as a novel mechanism to fine-tune cholinergic transmission in the nervous system and in the pathogenesis associated to the alphaC418W nAChR.},

Irradiation at 254 nm for 60 s in the presence of 1 mM [(14)C]halothane resulted in incorporation of approximately 0.5 mol of (14)C/mol of subunit, with photolabeling distributed within the nAChR extracellular and transmembrane domains, primarily at tyrosines. GammaTyr-111 in ACh binding site segment E was labeled, while alphaTyr-93 in segment A was not. Within the transmembrane domain, alphaTyr-213 within alphaM1 and deltaTyr-228 within deltaM1 were photolabeled, while no labeled amino acids were identified within the deltaM2 ion channel domain. Although the efficiency of photolabeling at the subunit level was unaffected by agonist, competitive antagonist, or isoflurane, state-dependent photolabeling was seen in a delta subunit fragment beginning at deltaPhe-206. Labeling of deltaTyr-212 in the extracellular domain was inhibited >90% by d-tubocurarine, whereas addition of either carbamylcholine or isoflurane had no effect. Within M1, the level of photolabeling of deltaTyr-228 with [(14)C]halothane was increased by carbamylcholine (90%) or d-tubocurarine (50%), but it was inhibited by isoflurane (40%). Within the structure of the nAChR transmembrane domain, deltaTyr-228 projects into an extracellular, water accessible pocket formed by amino acids from the deltaM1-deltaM3 alpha-helices. Halothane photolabeling of deltaTyr-228 provides initial evidence that halothane and isoflurane bind within this pocket with occupancy or access increased in the nAChR desensitized state compared to the closed channel state. Halothane binding at this site may contribute to the functional inhibition of nAChRs.},

While the physiology of squid giant axons has been extensively studied, very little is known about the distribution and function of the neurotransmitters and receptors that mediate inhibitory transmission at the synapses. In this study we investigated whether γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activates neurotransmitter receptors in stellate ganglia membranes. To overcome the low abundance of GABA-like mRNAs in invertebrates and the low expression of GABA in cephalopods, we used a two-electrode voltage clamp technique to determine if Xenopus laevis oocytes injected with cell membranes from squid stellate ganglia responded to GABA. Using this method, membrane patches containing proteins and ion channels from the squid's stellate ganglion were incorporated into the surface of oocytes. We demonstrated that GABA activates membrane receptors in cellular membranes isolated from squid stellate ganglia. Using the same approach, we were able to record native glutamate-evoked currents. The squid's GABA receptors showed an EC(50) of 98 μmol l(-1) to GABA and were inhibited by zinc (IC(50) = 356 μmol l(-1)). Interestingly, GABA receptors from the squid were only partially blocked by bicuculline. These results indicate that the microtransplantation of native cell membranes is useful to identify and characterize scarce membrane proteins. Moreover, our data also support the role of GABA as an ionotropic neurotransmitter in cephalopods, acting through chloride-permeable membrane receptors.},

Understanding of molecular mechanisms and pharmacology of glycine receptors has been hindered by a lack of high-resolution structures. Here we report electron cryo-microscopy structures of the zebrafish α1 GlyR with strychnine, glycine, or glycine and ivermectin (glycine/ivermectin). Strychnine arrests the receptor in an antagonist-bound closed ion channel state, glycine stabilizes the receptor in an agonist-bound open channel state, and the glycine/ivermectin complex adopts a potentially desensitized or partially open state. Relative to the glycine-bound state, strychnine expands the agonist-binding pocket via outward movement of the C loop, promotes rearrangement of the extracellular and transmembrane domain 'wrist' interface, and leads to rotation of the transmembrane domain towards the pore axis, occluding the ion conduction pathway. These structures illuminate the GlyR mechanism and define a rubric to interpret structures of Cys-loop receptors.},

  abstract = {Nicotine is a very widely used drug of abuse, which exerts a number of neurovegetative, behavioural and psychological effects by interacting with neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (NAChRs). These receptors are distributed widely in human brain and ganglia, and form a family of ACh-gated ion channels of different subtypes, each of which has a specific pharmacology and physiology. As human NAChRs have been implicated in a number of human central nervous system disorders (including the neurodegenerative Alzheimer?s disease, schizophrenia and epilepsy), they are suitable potential targets for rational drug therapy. Much of our current knowledge about the structure and function of NAChRs comes from studies carried out in other species, such as rodents and chicks, and information concerning human nicotinic receptors is still incomplete and scattered in the literature. Nevertheless, it is already evident that there are a number of differences in the anatomical distribution, physiology, pharmacology, and expression regulation of certain subtypes between the nicotinic systems of humans and other species. This review will attempt to survey the major achievements reached in the study of the structure and function of NAChRs by examining the molecular basis of their functional diversity viewed mainly from pharmacological and biochemical perspectives. It will also summarize our current knowledge concerning the structure and function of the NAChRs expressed by other species, and the newly discovered drugs used to classify their numerous subtypes. Finally, the role of NAChRs in behaviour and pathology will be considered.},

The structure of the proteolysed receptor, made up of two fragments and comprising part of the intracellular domain, was determined in complex with stabilizing nanobodies. The extracellular domain reveals the detailed anatomy of the neurotransmitter binding site capped by a nanobody. The membrane domain delimits an aqueous pore with a 4.6 Å constriction. In the intracellular domain, a bundle of five intracellular helices creates a closed vestibule where lateral portals are obstructed by loops.

General anesthetics were once believed to be ?drugs without receptors? but this view has been largely abandoned. During the past decade significant progress in our understanding of the mechanisms of general anesthetic action at the molecular, cellular and neural systems levels has been made. Different molecular targets in various regions of the nervous system are involved in the multiple components of anesthetic action, and these targets can vary between specific anesthetics. Neurotransmitter-gated ion channels, particularly receptors for GABA and glutamate, are modulated by most anesthetics, at both synaptic and extrasynaptic sites, and additional ion channels and receptors are also being recognized as important targets for general anesthetics. In this article, these developments, which have important implications for the development of more-selective anesthetics, are reviewed in the context of recent advances in ion channel structure and function.},

  abstract = {The X-ray structure of a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel from Erwinia chrysanthemi (ELIC) has recently provided structural insight into this family of ion channels at high resolution. The structure shows a homo-pentameric protein with a barrel-stave architecture that defines an ion-conduction pore located on the fivefold axis of symmetry. In this structure, the wide aqueous vestibule that is encircled by the extracellular ligand-binding domains of the five subunits narrows to a discontinuous pore that spans the lipid bilayer. The pore is constricted by bulky hydrophobic residues towards the extracellular side, which probably serve as barriers that prevent the diffusion of ions. This interrupted pore architecture in ELIC thus depicts a non-conducting conformation of a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel, the thermodynamically stable state in the absence of bound ligand. As ligand binding promotes pore opening in these ion channels and the specific ligand for ELIC has not yet been identified, we have turned our attention towards a homologous protein from the cyanobacterium Gloebacter violaceus (GLIC). GLIC was shown to form proton-gated channels that are activated by a pH decrease on the extracellular side and that do not desensitize after activation. Both prokaryotic proteins, ELIC and GLIC form ion channels that are selective for cations over anions with poor discrimination among monovalent cations, characteristics that resemble the conduction properties of the cation-selective branch of the family that includes acetylcholine and serotonin receptors. Here we present the X-ray structure of GLIC at 3.1 A resolution. The structure reveals a conformation of the channel that is distinct from ELIC and that probably resembles the open state. In combination, both structures suggest a novel gating mechanism for pentameric ligand-gated ion channels where channel opening proceeds by a change in the tilt of the pore-forming helices.},

  abstract = {Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) are key players in the early events of electrical signal transduction at chemical synapses. The family codes for a structurally conserved scaffold of channel proteins that open in response to the binding of neurotransmitter molecules. All proteins share a pentameric organization of identical or related subunits that consist of an extracellular ligand-binding domain followed by a transmembrane channel domain. The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is the most thoroughly studied member of the pLGIC family (for recent reviews see refs 1-3). Two sources of structural information provided an architectural framework for the family. The structure of the soluble acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP) defined the organization of the extracellular domain and revealed the chemical basis of ligand interaction. Electron microscopy studies of the nAChR from Torpedo electric ray have yielded a picture of the full-length protein and have recently led to the interpretation of an electron density map at 4.0 A resolution. Despite the wealth of experimental information, high-resolution structures of any family member have so far not been available. Until recently, the pLGICs were believed to be only expressed in multicellular eukaryotic organisms. The abundance of prokaryotic genome sequences, however, allowed the identification of several homologous proteins in bacterial sources. Here we present the X-ray structure of a prokaryotic pLGIC from the bacterium Erwinia chrysanthemi (ELIC) at 3.3 A resolution. Our study reveals the first structure of a pLGIC at high resolution and provides an important model system for the investigation of the general mechanisms of ion permeation and gating within the family.},

  abstract      = {The intact Xenopus laevis oocyte is a useful model system for studying expressed water and solute transporters but suffers from a number of limitations, most notably large unstirred layers and other intracellular diffusion barriers. To overcome these, we have developed a method for isolating plasma membrane vesicles from oocytes. This approach facilitates more precise control of the intravesicular environment and virtually eliminates the problem of unstirred layers in kinetic experiments. The isolation procedure results in 50.6-fold enrichment of the plasma membrane marker alkaline phosphodiesterase compared with the homogenate. Markers of late endosomes/lysosomes and mitochondria were not enriched, and the endoplasmic reticulum was enriched only modestly. Permeabilities of native plasma membrane to water and urea were 8.1 x 10(-4) and 5.6 x 10(-7) cm/s, respectively, values that are sufficiently low to classify them as barrier membranes. Phospholipid analysis by mass spectrometry showed the membrane, not including cholesterol, to be rich in phosphatidylcholine (35.8 mole percent), sphingomyelin (25.8 mole percent), and phosphatidylinositol (6.8 mole percent). Cholesterol concentration was 20.7 mole percent. Membrane vesicles isolated from oocytes expressing aquaporin-1 exhibited fourfold higher water permeability in stopped-flow experiments. Oocytes expressing mouse urea transporter A3 (UT-A3) exhibited 7.5-fold faster phloretin-inhibitable urea transport compared with water-injected controls. There was no difference in water permeability between these membrane vesicles, suggesting that UT-A3 is not a water carrier. In conclusion, we describe an improved method for the isolation of the oocyte plasma membrane that will allow the study of water and solute transport kinetics as well as substrate selectivity in heterologously expressed proteins.},

We observe an enrichment of cholesterol in the outer leaflet and a general non-ideal lateral mixing of the different lipid species. Transient domains with liquid-ordered character form and disappear on the microsecond time scale. These domains are coupled across the two membrane leaflets. In the outer leaflet, distinct nanodomains consisting of gangliosides are observed. Phosphoinositides show preferential clustering in the inner leaflet.

  abstract    = {Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) are ubiquitous neurotransmitter receptors in Bilateria, with a small number of known prokaryotic homologues. Here we describe a new inventory and phylogenetic analysis of pLGIC genes across all kingdoms of life. Our main finding is a set of pLGIC genes in unicellular eukaryotes, some of which are metazoan-like Cys-loop receptors, and others devoid of Cys-loop cysteines, like their prokaryotic relatives. A number of such "Cys-less" receptors also appears in invertebrate metazoans. Together, those findings draw a new distribution of pLGICs in eukaryotes. A broader distribution of prokaryotic channels also emerges, including a major new archaeal taxon, Thaumarchaeota. More generally, pLGICs now appear nearly ubiquitous in major taxonomic groups except multicellular plants and fungi. However, pLGICs are sparsely present in unicellular taxa, suggesting a high rate of gene loss and a non-essential character, contrasting with their essential role as synaptic receptors of the bilaterian nervous system. Multiple alignments of these highly divergent sequences reveal a small number of conserved residues clustered at the interface between the extracellular and transmembrane domains. Only the "Cys-loop" proline is absolutely conserved, suggesting the more fitting name "Pro loop" for that motif, and "Pro-loop receptors" for the superfamily. The infered molecular phylogeny shows a Cys-loop and a Cys-less clade in eukaryotes, both containing metazoans and unicellular members. This suggests new hypotheses on the evolutionary history of the superfamily, such as a possible origin of the Cys-loop cysteines in an ancient unicellular eukaryote. Deeper phylogenetic relationships remain uncertain, particularly around the split between bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes.},

  abstract = {Cys-loop receptor neurotransmitter-gated ion channels are pentameric assemblies of subunits that contain three domains: extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular. The extracellular domain forms the agonist binding site. The transmembrane domain forms the ion channel. The cytoplasmic domain is involved in trafficking, localization, and modulation by cytoplasmic second messenger systems but its role in channel assembly and function is poorly understood and little is known about its structure. The intracellular domain is formed by the large (>100 residues) loop between the alpha-helical M3 and M4 transmembrane segments. Putative prokaryotic Cys-loop homologues lack a large M3M4 loop. We replaced the complete M3M4 loop (115 amino acids) in the 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3A (5-HT(3A)) subunit with a heptapeptide from the prokaryotic homologue from Gloeobacter violaceus. The macroscopic electrophysiological and pharmacological characteristics of the homomeric 5-HT(3A)-glvM3M4 receptors were comparable to 5-HT(3A) wild type. The channels remained cation-selective but the 5-HT(3A)-glvM3M4 single channel conductance was 43.5 pS as compared with the subpicosiemens wild-type conductance. Coexpression of hRIC-3, a protein that modulates expression of 5-HT(3) and acetylcholine receptors, significantly attenuated 5-HT-induced currents with wild-type 5-HT(3A) but not 5-HT(3A)-glvM3M4 receptors. A similar deletion of the M3M4 loop in the anion-selective GABA-rho1 receptor yielded functional, GABA-activated, anion-selective channels. These results imply that the M3M4 loop is not essential for receptor assembly and function and suggest that the cytoplasmic domain may fold as an independent module from the transmembrane and extracellular domains.},

Using both native membranes and reconstituted membranes, it is shown that the detergent to lipid molar ratio is the most important parameter in determining the effect of the detergent on the functional properties of the receptor. Receptor-lipid complexes were quantitatively separated from detergent and excess lipids by centrifugation through detergent-free sucrose gradients. The lipid to protein molar ratio of the complexes could be precisely controlled by adjusting the cholate and lipid concentrations of the starting membranes. Analyses of both ion influx activity and ligand binding revealed that a minimum of 45 lipids per receptor was required for stabilization of the receptor in a fully functional state. Progressive irreversible inactivation occurred as the lipid to protein mole ratio was decreased below 45, and complete inactivation occurred below a ratio of 20. The results are consistent with a functional requirement for a single shell of lipids around the perimeter of the receptor.},

  abstract  = {The 43 kDa receptor-associated protein rapsyn is a myristoylated peripheral protein that plays a central role in nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering at the neuromuscular junction. In a previous study, we demonstrated that rapsyn is specifically cotransported with AChR via post-Golgi vesicles targeted to the innervated surface of the Torpedo electrocyte (Marchand et al., 2000). In the present study, to further elucidate the mechanisms for sorting and assembly of postsynaptic proteins, we analyzed the dynamics of the intracellular trafficking of fluorescently labeled rapsyn in the transient-expressing COS-7 cell system. Our approach was based on fluorescence, time-lapse imaging, and immunoelectron microscopies, as well as biochemical analyses. We report that newly synthesized rapsyn associates with the trans-Golgi network compartment and traffics via vesiculotubular organelles toward the cell surface of COS-7 cells. The targeting of rapsyn organelles appeared to be mediated by a microtubule-dependent transport. Using cotransfection experiments of rapsyn and AChR, we observed that these two molecules codistribute within distal exocytic routes and at the plasma membrane. Triton X-100 extraction on ice and flotation gradient centrifugation demonstrated that rapsyn and AChR are recovered in low-density fractions enriched in two rafts markers: caveolin-1 and flotillin-1. We propose that sorting and targeting of these two companion molecules are mediated by association with cholesterol-sphingolipid-enriched raft microdomains. Collectively, these data highlight rapsyn as an itinerant vesicular protein that may play a dynamic role in the sorting and targeting of its companion receptor to the postsynaptic membrane. These data also raise the interesting hypothesis of the participation of the raft machinery in the targeting of signaling molecules to synaptic sites.},

This structure reveals architectural elements unique to eukaryotic Cys-loop receptors, explains the mechanistic consequences of multiple human disease mutations and shows an unexpected structural role for a conserved N-linked glycan. The receptor was crystallized bound to a previously unknown agonist, benzamidine, opening a new avenue for the rational design of GABAAR modulators. The channel region forms a closed gate at the base of the pore, representative of a desensitized state. These results offer new insights into the signalling mechanisms of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels and enhance current understanding of GABAergic neurotransmission.},

The gate is a constricting hydrophobic girdle at the middle of the lipid bilayer, formed by weak interactions between neighbouring inner helices. When acetylcholine enters the ligand-binding domain, it triggers rotations of the protein chains on opposite sides of the entrance to the pore. These rotations are communicated through the inner helices, and open the pore by breaking the girdle apart.},

  abstract = {Etomidate, one of the most potent general anesthetics used clinically, acts at micromolar concentrations as an anesthetic and positive allosteric modulator of gamma-aminobutyric acid responses, whereas it inhibits muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) at concentrations above 10 microm. We report here that TDBzl-etomidate, a photoreactive etomidate analog, acts as a positive allosteric nAChR modulator rather than an inhibitor, and we identify its binding sites by photoaffinity labeling. TDBzl-etomidate (>10 microm) increased the submaximal response to acetylcholine (10 microm) with a 2.5-fold increase at 60 microm. At higher concentrations, it inhibited the binding of the noncompetitive antagonists [(3)H]tetracaine and [(3)H]phencyclidine to Torpedo nAChR-rich membranes (IC(50) values of 0. 8 mm). nAChR-rich membranes were photolabeled with [(3)H]TDBzl-etomidate, and labeled amino acids were identified by Edman degradation. For nAChRs photolabeled in the absence of agonist (resting state), there was tetracaine-inhibitable photolabeling of amino acids in the ion channel at positions M2-9 (deltaLeu-265) and M2-13 (alphaVal-255 and deltaVal-269), whereas labeling of alphaM2-10 (alphaSer-252) was not inhibited by tetracaine but was enhanced 10-fold by proadifen or phencyclidine. In addition, there was labeling in gammaM3 (gammaMet-299), a residue that contributes to the same pocket in the nAChR structure as alphaM2-10. The pharmacological specificity of labeling of residues, together with their locations in the nAChR structure, indicate that TDBzl-etomidate binds at two distinct sites: one within the lumen of the ion channel (labeling of M2-9 and -13), an inhibitory site, and another at the interface between the alpha and gamma subunits (labeling of alphaM2-10 and gammaMet-299) likely to be a site for positive allosteric modulation.},

  abstract  = {Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are made of multiple subunits with diversified functions. The nAChR alpha 7-subunit has a property of high Ca2+ permeability and may have specific functions and localization within the plasma membrane as a signal transduction molecule. In PC-12 cells, fractionation by sucrose gradient centrifugation revealed that nAChR alpha 7 existed in low-density, cholesterol-enriched plasma membrane microdomains known as lipid rafts where flotillin also exists. In contrast, nAChR alpha 5- and beta2-subunits were located in high-density fractions, out of the lipid rafts. Type 6 adenylyl cyclase (AC6), a calcium-inhibitable isoform, was also found in lipid rafts and was coimmunoprecipitated with nAChR alpha 7. Cholesterol depletion from plasma membranes with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin redistributed nAChR alpha 7 and AC6 diffusely within plasma membranes. Nicotine stimulation reduced forskolin-stimulated AC activity by 35%, and this inhibition was negated by either treatment with alpha-bungarotoxin, a specific antagonist of nAChR alpha 7, or cholesterol depletion from plasma membranes. The effect of cholesterol depletion was negated by the addition of cholesterol. These data suggest that nAChR alpha 7 has a specific membrane localization relative to other nAChR subunits and that lipid rafts are necessary to localize nAChR alpha 7 with AC within plasma membranes. In addition, nAChR alpha 7 may regulate the AC activity via Ca2+ within lipid rafts.},

  abstract = {ELIC, the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel from Erwinia chrysanthemi, is a prototype for Cys-loop receptors. Here we show that acetylcholine is a competitive antagonist for ELIC. We determine the acetylcholine-ELIC cocrystal structure to a 2.9-A resolution and find that acetylcholine binding to an aromatic cage at the subunit interface induces a significant contraction of loop C and other structural rearrangements in the extracellular domain. The side chain of the pore-lining residue F247 reorients and the pore size consequently enlarges, but the channel remains closed. We attribute the inability of acetylcholine to activate ELIC primarily to weak cation-pi and electrostatic interactions in the pocket, because an acetylcholine derivative with a simple quaternary-to-tertiary ammonium substitution activates the channel. This study presents a compelling case for understanding the structural underpinning of the functional relationship between agonism and competitive antagonism in the Cys-loop receptors, providing a new framework for developing novel therapeutic drugs.},

  abstract = {The association of hemagglutinin (HA) with lipid rafts in the plasma membrane is an important feature of the assembly process of influenza virus A. Lipid rafts are thought to be small, fluctuating patches of membrane enriched in saturated phospholipids, sphingolipids, cholesterol and certain types of protein. However, raft-associating transmembrane (TM) proteins generally partition into Ld domains in model membranes, which are enriched in unsaturated lipids and depleted in saturated lipids and cholesterol. The reason for this apparent disparity in behavior is unclear, but model membranes differ from the plasma membrane in a number of ways. In particular, the higher protein concentration in the plasma membrane may influence the partitioning of membrane proteins for rafts. To investigate the effect of high local protein concentration, we have conducted coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG MD) simulations of HA clusters in domain-forming bilayers. During the simulations, we observed a continuous increase in the proportion of raft-type lipids (saturated phospholipids and cholesterol) within the area of membrane spanned by the protein cluster. Lateral diffusion of unsaturated lipids was significantly attenuated within the cluster, while saturated lipids were relatively unaffected. On this basis, we suggest a possible explanation for the change in lipid distribution, namely that steric crowding by the slow-diffusing proteins increases the chemical potential for unsaturated lipids within the cluster region. We therefore suggest that a local aggregation of HA can be sufficient to drive association of the protein with raft-type lipids. This may also represent a general mechanism for the targeting of TM proteins to rafts in the plasma membrane, which is of functional importance in a wide range of cellular processes.},

  abstract  = {Emerging concepts of membrane organization point to the compartmentalization of the plasma membrane into distinct lipid microdomains. This lateral segregation within cellular membranes is based on cholesterol-sphingolipid-enriched microdomains or lipid rafts which can move laterally and assemble into large-scale domains to create plasma membrane specialized cellular structures at specific cell locations. Such domains are likely involved in the genesis of the postsynaptic specialization at the neuromuscular junction, which requires the accumulation of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), through activation of the muscle specific kinase MuSK by the neurotropic factor agrin and the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. We used C2C12 myotubes as a model system to investigate whether agrin-elicited AChR clustering correlated with lipid rafts. In a previous study, using two-photon Laurdan confocal imaging, we showed that agrin-induced AChR clusters corresponded to condensed membrane domains: the biophysical hallmark of lipid rafts [F. Stetzkowski-Marden, K. Gaus, M. Recouvreur, A. Cartaud, J. Cartaud, Agrin elicits membrane condensation at sites of acetylcholine receptor clusters in C2C12 myotubes, J. Lipid Res. 47 (2006) 2121-2133]. We further demonstrated that formation and stability of AChR clusters depend on cholesterol. We also reported that three different extraction procedures (Triton X-100, pH 11 or isotonic Ca++, Mg++ buffer) generated detergent resistant membranes (DRMs) with similar cholesterol/GM1 ganglioside content, which are enriched in several signalling postsynaptic components, notably AChR, the agrin receptor MuSK, rapsyn and syntrophin. Upon agrin engagement, actin and actin-nucleation factors such as Arp2/3 and N-WASP were transiently recovered within raft fractions suggesting that the activation by agrin can trigger actin polymerization. Taken together, the present data suggest that AChR clustering at the neuromuscular junction relies upon a mechanism of raft coalescence driven by agrin-elicited actin polymerization. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Here, we have furthered our studies by characterizing the influence of different lipid host compositions on the distribution of purified AChR reconstituted in two model systems (POPC:Chol, 1:1 and POPC:Chol:SM, 1:1:1), involving a) different SM species (porcine brain SM (bSM), 16:0-SM, 18:0-SM or 24:1-SM); or b) induced transbilayer asymmetry, resulting from enrichment in bSM in the external hemilayer. AChR distribution was evaluated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer efficiency between the AChR intrinsic fluorescence and Laurdan or dehydroergosterol fluorescence, and by analyzing the distribution of AChR in detergent-resistant and detergent-soluble fractions (1% Triton X-100, 4 °C). bSM-induced transbilayer asymmetry or the presence of 16:0-SM and/or 18:0-SM (unlike bSM or 24:1-SM) resulted in the preferential partitioning of AChR in Lo domains, suggesting that the localization of AChR in ordered domains strongly depends on the characteristics of the host lipid membrane, and in particular on the sphingolipid composition and transbilayer asymmetry.},

Rapsyn plays a central role in directing and clustering nAChR during cellular differentiation and neuromuscular junction formation; however, it has not been demonstrated whether rapsyn is the only cause of receptor immobilization. Here, we used single-molecule tracking methods to investigate nAChR mobility in plasma membranes of myoblast cells during their differentiation to myotubes in the presence and absence of rapsyn. We found that in myoblasts the majority of nAChR were immobile and that ∼20% of the receptors showed restricted diffusion in small domains of ∼50 nm. In myoblasts devoid of rapsyn, the fraction of mobile nAChR was considerably increased, accompanied by a 3-fold decrease in the immobile population of nAChR with respect to rapsyn-expressing cells. Half of the mobile receptors were confined to domains of ∼120 nm. Measurements performed in heterologously transfected HEK cells confirmed the direct immobilization of nAChR by rapsyn. However, irrespective of the presence of rapsyn, about one-third of nAChR were confined in 300-nm domains. Our results show (i) that rapsyn efficiently immobilizes nAChR independently of other postsynaptic scaffold components; (ii) nAChR is constrained in confined membrane domains independently of rapsyn; and (iii) in the presence of rapsyn, the size of these domains is strongly reduced.},

We found all six mutants to be in the same ?locally closed? conformation using X-ray crystallography, sharing most of the features of the open form but showing a locally closed pore as a result of a concerted bending of all of its M2 helices. The mutants adopt several variant conformations of the M2-M3 loop, and in all cases an interacting lipid that is observed in the open form disappears. A single cross-linked mutant is functional, according to electrophysiology, and the locally closed structure of this mutant indicates that it has an increased flexibility. Further cross-linking, accessibility and molecular dynamics data suggest that the locally closed form is a functionally relevant conformation that occurs during allosteric gating transitions.},

The mechanism of nAChR clustering by rapsyn was analyzed by expressing nAChRs in HEK293T cells with various fragments of mouse rapsyn fused to green fluorescent protein. Membrane targeting of rapsyn is conferred solely by its acylated N terminus, as the myristoylated N-terminal 15 amino acids of rapsyn are sufficient to target green fluorescent protein to the plasma membrane. However, neither N-terminal myristoylation nor the conserved N-terminal amino acid sequence is essential. Membrane targeting, self-association, and nAChR clustering are preserved when the first 10 amino acids of rapsyn were replaced by those of src, which also contains a consensus sequence for N-myristoylation, or by those of GAP43, which contains a palmitoylation sequence. Rapsyn1-90, containing two tetratrichopeptide repeats is sufficient for self-association. Rapsyn1-360, lacking the cysteine rich domain, clusters nAChRs, while rapsyn1-287, containing seven tetratrichopeptide repeats, does not cluster nAChRs. We identified rapsyn298-331 as a potential coiled-coil domain, and established that mutations disrupting coiled-coil propensity prevent nAChR clustering. Thus the structural domains of rapsyn necessary for membrane targeting, self-association, and nAChR clustering are distinct, with nAChR-rapsyn interaction mediated by a previously unrecognized coiled-coil motif.},

  abstract = {The β-secretase, BACE, is a membrane spanning aspartic protease, which cleaves the amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the first step of proteolytic processing leading to the formation of the neurotoxic β-amyloid peptide (Aβ). Previous results have suggested that the regulation of β-secretase and BACE access to APP is lipid dependent, and involves lipid rafts. Using the baculovirus expression system, we have expressed recombinant human full-length BACE in insect cells and purified milligram amounts to homogeneity. We have studied partitioning of fluorophor-conjugated BACE between the liquid ordered and disordered phases in giant (10–150 μm) unilamellar vesicles, and found ∼20% to associate with the raft-like, liquid-ordered phase; the fraction associated with liquid-ordered phase increased upon cross-linking of raft lipids. To examine involvement of individual lipid species in modulating BACE activity, we have reconstituted the purified BACE in large (∼100 nm) unilamellar vesicles, and determined its specific activity in vesicles of various lipid compositions. We have identified 3 groups of lipids that stimulate proteolytic activity of BACE: 1) neutral glycosphingolipids (cerebrosides), 2) anionic glycerophospholipids, and 3) sterols (cholesterol).},

With [(3)H]AziPm and propofol, we determined that alkylphenol general anesthetics bind selectively and specifically to multiple synaptic protein targets. In contrast, the alkylphenol anesthetics do not bind to specific sites on abundant phospholipids or cholesterol, although [(3)H]AziPm shows selectivity for photolabeling phosphatidylethanolamines. Together, our experiments suggest that alkylphenol anesthetic substrates are widespread in number and distribution, similar to those of volatile general anesthetics, and that multi-target mechanisms likely underlie their pharmacology.},

We modeled the influence of OmpA on the local lipid composition both at a coarse-grained (CG) resolution using conventional molecular dynamics, and at an atomistic resolution within the semi-grand canonical ensemble using mutation moves to rapidly approach an equilibrium lateral distribution of lipids. Moderate enrichment of the shorter tail component (either DDPC in DDPC/DMPC mixtures or DMPC in DMPC/DSPC mixtures) extending 2-3 nm away from the protein surface was observed with both the atomistic and CG models. The similarity in trends suggests that the more computationally economical CG models capture the essential features of lipid sorting induced by hydrophobic mismatch.},

However, the underlying signaling mechanisms remain poorly defined. We show that agrin stimulates a dynamic translocation of the AChR into lipid rafts-cholesterol and sphingolipid-rich microdomains in the plasma membrane. This follows MuSK partition into lipid rafts and requires its activation. Disruption of lipid rafts inhibits MuSK activation and downstream signaling and AChR clustering in response to agrin. Rapsyn, an intracellular protein necessary for AChR clustering, is located constitutively in lipid rafts, but its interaction with the AChR is inhibited when lipid rafts are perturbed. These results reveal that lipid rafts may regulate AChR clustering by facilitating the agrin/MuSK signaling and the interaction between the receptor and rapsyn, both necessary for AChR clustering and maintenance. These results provide insight into mechanisms of AChR cluster formation.},

Furthermore, the number of rapsyn-binding sites per receptor (a heteropentamer) has been controversial. Here, we show by cryoelectron tomography and subtomogram averaging of Torpedo postsynaptic membrane that receptors are connected by up to three rapsyn bridges, the minimum number required to form a 2D network. Half of the receptors belong to rapsyn-connected groups comprising between two and fourteen receptors.

(??2-??4) subunits, which have different pharmacological and biophysical properties and locations in the brain. The lack of subtype-specific ligands and the fact that many neuronal cells express multiple subtypes initially hampered the identification of the different native nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes, but the increasing knowledge of subtype composition and roles will be of considerable interest for the development of new and clinically useful nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ligands. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMSs) are heterogeneous disorders in which the safety margin of neuromuscular transmission is compromised by one or more mechanisms. Specific diagnosis of a CMS is important as some medications that benefit one type of CMS can be detrimental in another type. In some CMSs, strong clinical clues point to a specific diagnosis. In other CMSs, morphologic and in vitro electrophysiologic studies of the neuromuscular junction, determination of the number of acetylcholine receptors (AchRs) per junction, and molecular genetic studies may be required for a specific diagnosis. Strategies for therapy are based on whether a given CMS decreases or increases the synaptic response to acetylcholine (ACh). Cholinesterase inhibitors that increase the synaptic response to ACh and 3,4-diaminopyridine, which increases ACh release, are useful when the synaptic response to ACh is attenuated. Long-lived open-channel blockers of the AChR, quinidine, and fluoxetine, are useful w},

The historical developments in diagnosis and treatment of MG are reviewed. We analyzed the clinical course of MG as influenced by age, gender, thymectomy, thymomectomy, and the presence of antibodies to acetylcholine receptors (AChR). The clinical course of MG was significantly influenced by age and gender, and these need special attention in managing patients. The most severe level of weakness and high mortality occurred during the first 1 to 2 years of the disease, after which many patients experienced improvement. For treating MG patients the usefulness of thymectomy remains to be proven, and novel drugs need to be developed to increase the number as well as normal functioning of the AChRs and other components of the neuromuscular system.},

AChR deficiency is frequently due to homozygous or heteroallelic mutations in the AChR epsilon subunit, most of which cause truncation of the polypeptide chain and loss of surface expression of AChR. Here we identified mutations epsilon1369delG and epsilonY458X, located in the 18 amino acid epsilon subunit C-terminus that lies extracellular to the M4 transmembrane domain. We then incorporated green fluorescent protein (GFP) into the intracellular loop between M3 and M4 of mutant or wild-type epsilon subunits and expressed the AChRs in RD or HEK 293 cells. AChR containing wild-type GFP-tagged epsilon subunits were incorporated into the surface membrane, whereas the GFP-tagged AChR mutant epsilon subunits co-localized with an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker and were not expressed on the cell},

  abstract  = {About 20 % of the identified cases of congenital myasthenic syndromes are due to defects causing overstimulation of endplate ACh receptors, with consequent excessive Ca2+ entry, endplate structural damage, and impairment of the neuromuscular transmission. Overstimulation arises from extended dwelling of ACh in the synaptic cleft because of absence of acetylcholine esterase or from prolonged activation of ``slow-channel'' mutant ACh receptors. The high Ca2+ permeability of human endplate ACh receptor, recently described, likely predisposes to excitotoxic damage. The good knowledge of ACh receptor function has allowed molecular understanding of the defects introduced in channel kinetics and Ca2+ permeability by slow-channel mutations and the design of efficient therapeutic strategies. These forms of congenital myasthenic syndrome are treated by limiting ACh-induced cation entry, thus preventing endplate degeneration. Several molecules of wide clinical use, such as fluoxetine and quinidine, but also verapamil and salbutamol modulate ACh receptor kinetics and ion selectivity and may be used to lower ACh-evoked responses in these patients. In this contribution we summarize the main findings in the field.},

For the Cys-loop superfamily of receptors, recent structural data have catalysed a leap in our understanding of the three steps of chemical-to-electrical transduction: neurotransmitter binding, communication between the binding site and the barrier to ions, and opening and closing of the barrier. The emerging insights might be expected to explain how mutations of receptors cause neurological disease, but the opposite is generally true. Namely, analyses of disease-causing mutations have clarified receptor structure–function relationships as well as mechanisms governing the postsynaptic response. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Membrane targeting of rapsyn is conferred solely by its acylated N terminus, as the myristoylated N-terminal 15 amino acids of rapsyn are sufficient to target green fluorescent protein to the plasma membrane. However, neither N-terminal myristoylation nor the conserved N-terminal amino acid sequence is essential. Membrane targeting, self-association, and nAChR clustering are preserved when the first 10 amino acids of rapsyn were replaced by those of src, which also contains a consensus sequence for N-myristoylation, or by those of GAP43, which contains a palmitoylation sequence. Rapsyn1-90, containing two tetratrichopeptide repeats is sufficient for self-association. Rapsyn1-360, lacking the cysteine rich domain, clusters nAChRs, while rapsyn1-287, containing seven tetratrichopeptide repeats, does not cluster nAChRs. We identified rapsyn298-331 as a potential coiled-coil domain, and established that mutations disrupting coiled-coil propensity prevent nAChR clustering. Thus the structural domains of rapsyn necessary for membrane targeting, self-association, and nAChR clustering are distinct, with nAChR-rapsyn interaction mediated by a previously unrecognized coiled-coil motif.},

The postsynaptic CMSs identified to date stem from a deficiency or kinetic abnormality of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). All CMSs with a kinetic abnormality of AChR, as well as many CMSs with a deficiency of AChR, have been traced to mutations in AChR-subunit genes. However, in a subset of patients with EP AChR deficiency, the genetic defect has remained elusive. Rapsyn, a 43-kDa postsynaptic protein, plays an essential role in the clustering of AChR at the EP. Seven tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) of rapsyn subserve self-association, a coiled-coil domain binds to AChR, and a RING-H2 domain associates with β-dystroglycan and links rapsyn to the subsynaptic cytoskeleton. Rapsyn self-association precedes recruitment of AChR to rapsyn clusters. In four patients with EP AChR deficiency but with no mutations in AChR subunits, we identify three re},

Recently, high-resolution structures of both open- and closed-pore conformations have been solved for a bacterial, an invertebrate, and a vertebrate receptor in this family. These data suggest that a common gating mechanism occurs, coupling neurotransmitter binding to pore opening, but they also pinpoint significant differences among subtypes. In this Review, we summarize the structural and functional data in light of these gating models and speculate about their mechanistic consequences on ion permeation, pathological mutations, as well as functional regulation by orthosteric and allosteric effectors.},

One important parameter is the hydrophobic thickness of the lipid bilayer, defined by the lengths of the lipid fatty acyl chains. Membrane proteins are not rigid entities, and deform to ensure good hydrophobic matching to the surrounding lipid bilayer. The structure of the lipid headgroup region is likely to be important in defining the structures of those parts of a membrane protein that are located in the lipid headgroup region. A number of examples are given where the conformation of the headgroup-embedded region of a membrane protein changes during the reaction cycle of the protein; activities of such proteins might be expected to be particularly sensitive to lipid headgroup structure. Differences in hydrogen bonding potential and hydration between the headgroups of phosphatidycholines and phosphatidylethanolamines could be important factors },

The focus of this review is the profound impact that the high disorder of DHA has on its interaction with cholesterol when the PUFA is incorporated into membrane phospholipids. Results from a battery of biophysical techniques are described. They demonstrate an aversion of DHA for the sterol that drives the lateral segregation of DHA-containing phospholipids into liquid disordered (ld) domains that are depleted in cholesterol. These domains are compositionally and organizationally the antithesis of lipid rafts, the much-studied liquid ordered (lo) domain that is enriched in predominantly saturated sphingolipids and cholesterol.

  abstract = {Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a highly debilitating disease caused by progressive degeneration of motorneurons (MNs). Due to the wide variety of genes and mutations identified in ALS, a highly varied etiology could ultimately converge to produce similar clinical symptoms. A major hypothesis in ALS research is the “distal axonopathy” with pathological changes occurring at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), at very early stages of the disease, prior to MNs degeneration and onset of clinical symptoms. The NMJ is a highly specialized cholinergic synapse, allowing signaling between muscle and nerve necessary for skeletal muscle function. This nerve-muscle contact is characterized by the clustering of the collagen-tailed form of acetylcholinesterase (ColQ-AChE), together with other components of the extracellular matrix and specific key molecules in the NMJ formation. Interestingly, in addition to their cholinergic role AChE is thought to play several ‘non-classical’ roles that do not require catalytic function, most prominent among these is facilitation of neurite growth, NMJ formation and survival. In all this context, abnormalities of AChE content have been found in plasma of ALS patients, in which AChE changes maybe reflect the neuromuscular disruption. We review these findings and particularly the evidences of changes of AChE at neuromuscular synapse in the pre-symptomatic stages of ALS.},

Our results show that DHA-PE induces phase separation into a DHA rich liquid crystalline (Lα) phase and a DHA poor gel (Lβ′) phase at overall DHA-PE concentrations as low as 0.1 mol%. In addition, we find that the structure of the Lβ′ phase, from which the DHA-PE molecules are largely excluded, is modified in the phase-separated state at low DHA-PE concentrations, with a decrease in bilayer thickness of 1.34 nm for 0.1 mol% at room temperature, compared to pure DPPC bilayers. This result is contrary to that seen in similar studies on mono-unsaturated lipids where an increase in bilayer thickness is observed.

  abstract = {Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (n ACh Rs) are members of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel superfamily that play important roles in the control of neurotransmitter release in the central and peripheral nervous system. These receptors are important therapeutic targets for the development of drugs against a number of mental health disorders and for marketed smoking cessation aids. Unfortunately, drug discovery has been hampered by difficulties in obtaining sufficiently selective compounds. Together with functional complexity of the receptors, this has made it difficult to obtain drugs with sufficiently high-target to off-target affinity ratios. The recent and ongoing progress in structural studies holds promise to help understand structure-function relationships of n ACh R drugs at the atomic level. This will undoubtedly lead to the design of more efficient drugs with fewer side effects. As a high-resolution structure of a n ACh R is yet to be determined, structural studies are to a large extent based on acetylcholine-binding proteins ( ACh BPs) that despite low overall sequence identity display a high degree of conservation of overall structure and amino acids at the ligand-binding site. Further, ACh BPs reproduce relative binding affinities of ligands at n ACh Rs. Over the past decade, ACh BPs have been used extensively as models for n ACh Rs and have aided the understanding of drug receptor interactions at n ACh Rs significantly. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Receptor activation either leads to fast excitatory responses or modulation of neurotransmitter release depending on their neuronal localisation. 5-HT(3) receptors are known to be expressed in the central nervous system in regions involved in the vomiting reflex, processing of pain, the reward system, cognition and anxiety control. In the periphery they are present on a variety of neurons and immune cells. 5-HT(3) receptors are known to be involved in emesis, pain disorders, drug addiction, psychiatric and GI disorders. Progress in molecular genetics gives direction to personalised medical strategies for treating complex diseases such as psychiatric and functional GI disorders and unravelling individual drug responses in pharmacogenetic approaches. Here we discuss the molecular basis of 5-HT(3) receptor diversity at the DNA and protein level, of which our knowledge has greatly extended in the last decade. We also evaluate their role in health and disease and describe specific case-control studies addressing the involvement of polymorphisms of 5-HT3 subunit genes in complex disorders and responses to drugs. Furthermore, we focus on the actual state of the pharmacological knowledge concerning not only classical 5-HT(3) antagonists--the setrons--but also compounds of various substance classes targeting 5-HT(3) receptors such as anaesthetics, opioids, cannabinoids, steroids, antidepressants and antipsychotics as well as natural compounds derived from plants. This shall point to alternative treatment options modulating the 5-HT(3) receptor system and open new possibilities for drug development in the future.},

  abstract = {a b s t r a c t Our current understanding of membrane lipid composition, structure and functions has led to the investigation of their role in cell signaling, both in healthy and pathological cells. As a consequence, therapies based on the regula-tion of membrane lipid composition and structure have been recently developed. This novel field, known as Mem-brane Lipid Therapy, is growing and evolving rapidly, providing treatments that are now in use or that are being studied for their application to oncological disorders, Alzheimer's disease, spinal cord injury, stroke, diabetes, obe-sity, and neuropathic pain. This field has arisen from relevant discoveries on the behavior of membranes in recent decades, and it paves the way to adopt new approaches in modern pharmacology and nutrition. This innovative area will promote further investigation into membranes and the development of new therapies with molecules that target the cell membrane. Due to the prominent roles of membranes in the cells' physiology and the paucity of therapeutic approaches based on the regulation of the lipids they contain, it is expected that membrane lipid therapy will provide new treatments for numerous pathologies. The first on-purpose rationally designed molecule in this field, minerval, is currently being tested in clinical trials and it is expected to enter the market around 2020. However, it seems feasible that during the next few decades other membrane regulators will also be marketed for the treatment of human pathologies.},

Diagnosis of Alzheimer-type disease was based on the presence of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in post-mortem sections. Several highly significant and specific differences were observed between the two groups. Adrenic acid (22:4 n-6) was three to four times higher in the grey matter but lower in the white matter in each of the three regions in the Alzheimer brains than in the control group. These alterations were compensated by reciprocal changes in 18:0 in the grey matter and 16:1 fatty acids in the white matter. There was no significant difference in the proportion of other fatty acids, including those of the n-6 and n-3 series, in either the grey or the white matter of any of the three regions of the two groups, except for a higher proportion of 22:6 n-3 in the parietal white matter in the Alzheimer patients. There was no significant relationship between the levels of the individual fatty acids and age at death. It is suggested that the alterations in the fatty acid composition observed in the brains of Alzheimer patients may be caused by an aberration in the system by which essential fatty acids are transported into the brain},

Furthermore, low serum DHA is a significant risk factor for the development of AD. The relative concentration of DHA and other fatty acids, however, in the plasma of AD patients compared with patients with other kinds of dementias (other dementias; OD), patients who are cognitively impaired but nondemented (CIND), or normal patients is not known. In this study we analyzed the total phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) fractions of plasma from patients diagnosed with AD, OD, or CIND and compared them with a group of elderly control subjects with normal cognitive functioning. Plasma phospholipid and PC levels of 20:5n-3, DHA, total n-3 fatty acids, and the n-3/n-6 ratio were lower in the AD, OD, and CIND groups. Plasma phospholipid 24:0 was lower in the AD, OD, and CIND groups as compared with the group of control patients, and total n-6 fatty acid levels were higher in the AD and CIND groups only. In the plasma PE fraction, levels of 20:5n-3, DHA, and the total n-3 fatty acid levels were significantly lower in the AD, OD, and CIND groups. DHA levels were lower in the lysoPC fraction of CIND individuals only. There were no other differences in the fatty acid compositions of the different phospholipid fractions. Therefore, in AD, OD, and CIND individuals, low levels of n-3 fatty acids in the plasma may be a risk factor for cognitive impairment and/or dementia. Interestingly, a decreased level of plasma DHA was not limited to the AD patients but appears to be common in cognitive impairment with aging},

The enthorinal cortex (EC) neurons connecting to the hippocampus play a critical role in learning and memory. Here, we have exposed mice to diets based on canola:soybean oils (40 : 10, g/kg) or safflower : corn oils (25 : 25, g/kg) to investigate the relationship between the lipid profile of brain fatty acids and the intrinsic properties of EC neurons. Consumption of canola : soybean oil-enriched diet led to the increase of the monounsaturated fatty acid oleic acid and to a decrease of arachidonic acid in ethanolamine glycerophospholipids of the white matter. We also found an important rise in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) within ethanolamine glycerophospholipids and phosphatidylserine of gray matter. The canola:soybean oil treatment led to a shorter duration of action potential (-21%), a reduction in the duration of postsynaptic response (-21%) and increased firing activity (+43%). Data from additional experiments with animals fed DHA alone or DHA with canola oil suggested that dietary monounsaturated fatty acid may have contributed to these effects on EC neuron physiology. Since neuronal function within the enthorhinal-hippocampal loop is critical to learning and memory processes, the present data may provide a functional basis for the beneficial cognitive effects of canola oil-based diets.},

Metabolic profiling is therefore particularly indicated for the study of central nervous system by probing metabolic and neurochemical profiles of the healthy or diseased brain, in preclinical models or in human samples. In this review, we introduce the analytical and statistical requirements for metabolic profiling. Then, we focus on key studies in the field of metabolic profiling applied to the characterization of animal models and human samples of central nervous system disorders. We highlight the potential of metabolic profiling for pharmacological and physiological evaluation, diagnosis and drug therapy monitoring of patients affected by brain disorders.

  abstract  = {α-synuclein is a small protein abundantly expressed in the brain and located in synaptic terminals. The conversion of α-synuclein into oligomers and fibrils is the hallmark of a range of neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. α-synuclein is disordered in solution but can adopt an α-helical conformation when bound to lipid membranes. This lipid-protein interaction plays an important role in its proposed biological function, i.e., synaptic plasticity, but can also entail the aggregation of the protein. Both the chemical properties of the lipids and the lipid-to-protein-ratio have been reported to modulate the aggregation propensity of α-synuclein. In this review, the influence of changes in the nature and levels of lipids on the aggregation propensity of α-synuclein in vivo and in vitro will be discussed within a common general framework. In particular, while biophysical measurements and kinetic analyses of the time courses of α-synuclein aggregation in the presence of different types of lipid vesicles allow a mechanistic dissection of the influence of the lipids on α-synuclein aggregation, biological studies of cellular and animal models of Parkinson's disease allow the determination of changes in lipid levels and properties associated with the disease.},

Therefore, measures to prevent the mani-festation, and treatments to ameliorate the symptoms, of these disorders are in high demand. Brain lipids determine the localization and function of proteins in the cell membrane of neurons. Lipids may also act as neurotransmitters or other signalling molecules. The lipid composition of the brain can be influenced by nutrition, environmental factors, and by behavioural activity. Thus, lipids represent a target for preven-tive medicine of psychiatric disorders. Here we review how brain lipids contribute to normal behaviour and to major psychiatric disorders with the focus on phospholipids/fatty acids, sphingolipids, and endo-cannabinoids. Accumulating evidence suggests a crucial role for membrane forming and signalling lipids in the brain in the etiopathologies of depression, bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, and drug addiction. Lipids also represent potential preventive interventions for these psychiatric disorders by either targeted dietary supplementation or pharmacological manipulation of lipid regulating enzymes.},

  journal  = {Nature Publishing Group},
  year     = {2009},
  volume   = {8},
  abstract = {Acetylcholine (ACh) was one of the first neurotransmitters to be discovered and is one of the most important in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS). ACh is produced by the enzyme choline acetyltransferase and its actions are mediated through two types of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) — the G protein-coupled muscarinic AChRs and the nicotinic AChRs (nAChRs). The nAChRs are ligand-gated ion channels that are present in both the PNS (at the skeletal neuromuscular junction and in the autonomic nervous system) and the CNS. They are integral membrane proteins involved in the rapid 'phasic' effects of ACh under conditions of brief release of this neurotransmitter that produce high local concentrations. nAChRs can also respond to low ACh concentrations, and are the target of tonically released ACh and of systemically applied pharmacological agents, including nicotine. Typically, activation of brain nAChRs results in enhanced release of various key neurotrans-mitters, including dopamine, serotonin, glutamate and GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid). Knowledge of the atomic structure, functional organ-ization and conformational transitions of the nAChRs has recently progressed to the extent that these recep-tors are now among the most well understood allosteric membrane proteins (that is, proteins that mediate signal transduction between topographically distinct sites, through a conformational change) 1 . This makes them an exceptional model to investigate the molecular mecha-nisms of drug–receptor interactions 2–7 . The acute effect of ACh consists of the fast opening (microsecond to milli-second range) of a cationic channel that is permeable to Na + , K + and sometimes Ca 2+ ions. Of key importance for drug design, chronic exposure to ACh or nicotinic drugs causes a gradual decrease in the rate of this ionic response (100 ms to minutes), leading to a high-affinity, desensitized, closed state of the receptor 5 . Many of the clinically used drugs that target nAChRs are administered for months, resulting in long-term changes in receptor properties and/or number. Chronic exposure to nico-tine causes a striking increase, typically by twofold, in the total number of high-affinity receptors — a process termed upregulation 8 . There is considerable interest in modulating nAChRs to treat various nervous-system disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and tobacco addiction 9–11 . This article first examines recent advances in our understanding of the assembly, activity and con-formational transitions of the nAChR 5,12 , highlighting the relevance of these discoveries to the design of novel, improved drugs that target nAChRs. Recent develop-ments in the therapeutic application of nicotinic receptor ligands in the treatment of various CNS disorders are},

  abstract  = {Various types of lipids and their metabolic products associated with the biological membrane play a crucial role in signal transduction, modulation, and activation of receptors and as precursors of bioactive lipid mediators. Dysfunction in the lipid homeostasis in the brain could be a risk factor for the many types of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These neurodegenerative disorders are marked by extensive neuronal apoptosis, gliosis, and alteration in the differentiation, proliferation, and development of neurons. Sphingomyelin, a constituent of plasma membrane, as well as its primary metabolite ceramide acts as a potential lipid second messenger molecule linked with the modulation of various cellular signaling pathways. Excessive production of reactive oxygen species associated with enhanced oxidative stress has been implicated with these molecules and involved in the regulation of a variety of different neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders. Studies have shown that alterations in the levels of plasma lipid/cholesterol concentration may result to neurodegenerative diseases. Alteration in the levels of inflammatory cytokines and mediators in the brain has also been found to be implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. Although several mechanisms involved in neuronal apoptosis have been described, the molecular mechanisms underlying the correlation between lipid metabolism and the neurological deficits are not clearly understood. In the present review, an attempt has been made to provide detailed information about the association of lipids in neurodegeneration especially in Alzheimer's disease.},

Its transmembrane domain is the target for many modulators, including endogenous brain neurosteroids that impact anxiety, stress and depression, and for therapeutic drugs, such as general anesthetics. Understanding the basis for the modulation of GABAAR function requires high-resolution structures. Here we present the first atomic structures of a GABAAR chimera at 2.8-Å resolution, including those bound with potentiating and inhibitory neurosteroids. These structures define new allosteric binding sites for these modulators that are associated with the α-subunit transmembrane domain. Our findings will enable the exploitation of neurosteroids for therapeutic drug design to regulate GABAARs in neurological disorders.},

Lipids influence nAChR function by both conformational selection and kinetic mechanisms, stabilizing varying proportions of activatable versus non-activatable conformations, as well as influencing the transitions between these conformational States. Of note, some membranes stabilize an electrically silent uncoupled conformation that binds agonist but does not undergo agonist-induced conformational transitions. The uncoupled nAChR, however, does transition to activatable conformations in relatively thick lipid bilayers, such as those found in lipid rafts. In this review, we discuss current understanding of lipid-nAChR interactions in the context of increasingly available high resolution structural and functional data. These data highlight different sites of lipid action, including the lipid-exposed M4 transmembrane α-helix. Current evidence suggests that lipids alter nAChR function by modulating interactions between M4 and the adjacent transmembrane α-helices, M1 and M3. These interactions have also been implicated in both the folding and trafficking of nAChRs to the cell surface. We review current mechanistic understanding of lipid-nAChR interactions, and highlight potential biological roles for lipid-nAChR interactions in modulating the synaptic response.

  abstract = {Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) play a central role in intercellular communication in the nervous system and are involved in fundamental processes such as attention, learning, and memory. They are oligomeric protein assemblies that convert a chemical signal into an ion flux through the postsynaptic membrane, but the molecular mechanism of gating ions has remained elusive. Here, we present atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of the prokaryotic channels from Gloeobacter violaceus (GLIC) and Erwinia chrysanthemi (ELIC), whose crystal structures are thought to represent the active and the resting states of pLGICs, respectively, and of the eukaryotic glutamate-gated chloride channel from Caenorhabditis elegans (GluCl), whose open-channel structure was determined complexed with the positive allosteric modulator ivermectin. Structural observables extracted from the trajectories of GLIC and ELIC are used as progress variables to analyze the time evolution of GluCl, which was simulated in the absence of ivermectin starting from the structure with bound ivermectin. The trajectory of GluCl with ivermectin removed shows a sequence of structural events that couple agonist unbinding from the extracellular domain to ion-pore closing in the transmembrane domain. Based on these results, we propose a structural mechanism for the allosteric communication leading to deactivation/activation of the GluCl channel. This model of gating emphasizes the coupling between the quaternary twisting and the opening/closing of the ion pore and is likely to apply to other members of the pLGIC family.},

  abstract = {Lipid rafts are subdomains of the plasma membrane that contain high concentrations of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids. They exist as distinct liquid-ordered regions of the membrane that are resistant to extraction with nonionic detergents. Rafts appear to be small in size, but may constitute a relatively large fraction of the plasma membrane. While rafts have a distinctive protein and lipid composition, all rafts do not appear to be identical in terms of either the proteins or the lipids that they contain. A variety of proteins, especially those involved in cell signaling, have been shown to partition into lipid rafts. As a result, lipid rafts are thought to be involved in the regulation of signal transduction. Experimental evidence suggests that there are probably several different mechanisms through which rafts control cell signaling. For example, rafts may contain incomplete signaling pathways that are activated when a receptor or other required molecule is recruited into the raft. Rafts may also be important in limiting signaling, either by physical sequestration of signaling components to block nonspecific interactions, or by suppressing the intrinsic activity of signaling proteins present within rafts. This review provides an overview of the physical characteristics of lipid rafts and summarizes studies that have helped to elucidate the role of lipid rafts in signaling via receptor tyrosine kinases and G protein-coupled receptors.},

The membranes contained cholesterol (0.158 mg per mg protein), phospholipids (0.714 mg per mg protein) and gangliosides (0.125 mg per mg protein) as major constituents while cerebrosides and sulphatides were present in only trace amounts. Analysis of the gangliosides by thin-layer chromatography showed that there was no selective enrichment of any individual type in the plasma membranes in relation to total brain. The major phospholipids were ethanolamine (34.2 %), choline (41.6 %) and serine (13.2 %) phosphoglycerides. Inositol monophospho-glyceride (3.5 %), sphingomyelin (5.1 %) and lysolecithin (1.0 %) were relatively minor components while phosphatidylglycerol was not present. Each phospholipid class showed a specific fatty acid composition which differed from that of the other phospholipids. This result extends the specific fatty acid compositions observed in grey matter and certain sub-fractions by other workers. In particular, choline phos-phoglycerides contained high levels of saturated fatty acids while large quantities of docosahexaenoic acid were present in ethanolamine and serine phosphoglycerides.},

Such a multicomponent mixture exhibits a complex phase behavior with regions of structural and compositional heterogeneity. Especially domains formed in ternary mixtures, composed of saturated and unsaturated lipids together with cholesterol, have received a lot of attention as they may resemble raft formation in real cells. Here we apply a simulation model to assess the molecular nature of these domains at the nanoscale, information that has thus far eluded experimental determination. We are able to show the spontaneous separation of a saturated phosphatidylcholine (PC)/unsaturated PC/cholesterol mixture into a liquid-ordered and a liquid-disordered phase with structural and dynamic properties closely matching experimental data. The near-atomic resolution of the simulations reveals remarkable features of both domains and the boundary domain interface. Furthermore, we predict the existence of a small surface tension between the monolayer leaflets that drives registration of the domains. At the level of molecular detail, raft-like lipid mixtures show a surprising face with possible implications for many cell membrane processes.},

  abstract = {We present a refined model of the membrane-associated Torpedo acetylcholine (ACh) receptor at 4 Å resolution. An improved experimental density map was obtained from 342 electron images of helical tubes, and the refined structure was derived to an R-factor of 36.7% (Rfree37.9%) by standard crystallographic methods, after placing the densities corresponding to a single molecule into an artificial unit cell. The agreement between experimental and calculated phases along the helical layer-lines was used to monitor progress in the refinement and to give an independent measure of the accuracy. The atomic model allowed a detailed description of the whole receptor in the closed-channel form, including the ligand-binding and intracellular domains, which have not previously been interpreted at a chemical level. We confirm that the two ligand-binding α subunits have a different extended conformation from the three other subunits in the closed channel, and identify several interactions on both pairs of subunit interfaces, and within the α subunits, which may be responsible for their "distorted" structures. The ACh-coordinating amino acid side-chains of the α subunits are far apart in the closed channel, indicating that a localised rearrangement, involving closure of loops B and C around the bound ACh molecule, occurs upon activation. A comparison of the structure of the α subunit with that of AChBP having ligand present, suggests how the localised rearrangement overcomes the distortions and initiates the rotational movements associated with opening of the channel. Both vestibules of the channel are strongly electronegative, providing a cation-stabilising environment at either entrance of the membrane pore. Access to the pore on the intracellular side is further influenced by narrow lateral windows, which would be expected to screen out electrostatically ions of the wrong charge and size.  2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) prepared from ternary mixtures of dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine/sphingomyelin/cholesterol, a clear separation of liquid-disordered and sphingomyelin-enriched, liquid-ordered phases could be observed. This phase separation can lead to the fission of the liquid-ordered phase from the vesicle. Here we show that in cholesterol-containing GUVs, the phase separation can involve dynamic redistribution of lipids from one phase into another as a result of a cross-linking perturbation. We found that the molecular structure of a sterol used for the preparation of GUVs determines (i) its ability to induce phase separation and (ii) the curvature (positive or negative) of the formed liquid-ordered phase. As a consequence, the latter can pinch off to the outside or inside of the vesicle. Remarkably, some mixtures of sterols induce liquid-ordered domains exhibiting both positive and negative curvature, which can lead to a new type of budding behavior in GUVs. Our findings could have implications for the role of sterols in various cell-biological processes such as budding of secretory vesicles, endocytosis, or formation of multivesicular bodies.},

Based upon radioligand binding assays, AziPm stabilized the Torpedo nAChR in the resting state, whereas propofol stabilized the desensitized state. nAChR-rich membranes were photolabeled with [3H]AziPm, and labeled amino acids were identified by Edman degradation. [3H]AziPm binds at three sites within the nAChR transmembrane domain: (i) an intrasubunit site in the δ subunit helix bundle, photolabeling in the nAChR desensitized state (+agonist) δM2-18′ and two residues in δM1 (δPhe-232 and δCys-236); (ii) in the ion channel, photolabeling in the nAChR resting, closed channel state (−agonist) amino acids in the M2 helices (αM2-6′, βM2-6′ and -13′, and δM2-13′) that line the channel lumen (with photolabeling reduced by {>}90% in the desensitized state); and (iii) at the γ-α interface, photolabeling αM2-10′. Propofol enhanced [3H]AziPm photolabeling at αM2-10′. Propofol inhibited [3H]AziPm photolabeling within the δ subunit helix bundle at lower concentrations (IC50 = 40 μm) than it inhibited ion channel photolabeling (IC50 = 125 μm). These results identify for the first time a single intrasubunit propofol binding site in the nAChR transmembrane domain and suggest that this is the functionally relevant inhibitory binding site.},

In the present study, the effects of various concentrations of ethanol (1–250 mM) on the lipid composition after the first 6 days of Xenopus embryo development were investigated, using an in vitro fertilization technique. Lipid analysis revealed: (1) a decrease of the cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio mainly derived from a higher content of phospholipids; (2) an increase of phospholipid unsaturated fatty acids, especially C20:4 and C20:5, with ethanol concentration of 150–250 mM; (3) a decrease of lipid-bound sialic acid with ethanol concentrations of ≥5 mM. These results underline that sialoglycoconjugates are a more sensitive target of alcohol in comparison with other lipid components. The cultured embryo method certainly represents a useful model for investigation of the direct effects of ethanol on lipid metabolism, excluding maternal interference which can lead to misinterpretation of data.},

Its occurrence in both membrane leaflets commonly gives rise to matching liquid or liquid-ordered domains in the opposing monolayers. The underlying mechanism of such co-localization is not fully understood. The decrease of the line tension around the thicker ordered domain constitutes an important driving force. Yet, robust domain coupling requires an additional energy source, which we have now identified as thermal undulations. Our theoretical analysis of elastic deformations in a lipid bilayer shows that stiffer lipid domains tend to distribute into areas with lower fluctuations of monolayer curvature. These areas naturally align in the opposing monolayers. Thus, coupling requires both membrane leafs to display a heterogeneity in splay rigidities. The heterogeneity may either originate from intrinsic lipid properties or be acquired by adsorption of peripheral molecules. Undulations and line tension act synergistically: the gain in energy due a minimized line tension is proportional to domain radius and thus primarily fuels the registration of smaller domains; whereas the energetic contribution of undulations increases with membrane area and thus primarily acts to coalesce larger domains.},

It had high efficacy but low potency for &#x3B1;7 receptors, and the best potency and good efficacy for &#x3B1;4&#x3B2;2 receptors. Cytisine, a key lead compound for the development of smoking cessation agents, is a full agonist for both mammalian &#x3B1;7 and &#x3B1;3&#x3B2;4 receptors, but a full agonist only for the fish &#x3B1;7, with surprisingly low efficacy for &#x3B1;3&#x3B2;4. The efficacy of cytisine for &#x3B1;4&#x3B2;2 was somewhat greater than typically reported for mammalian &#x3B1;4&#x3B2;2. The ganglionic blocker mecamylamine was most potent for blocking &#x3B1;3&#x3B2;4 receptors, least potent for &#x3B1;7, and roughly equipotent for the muscle receptors and the &#x3B2;2-containing nAChR. However, the block of &#x3B2;2-containing receptors was slowly reversible, consistent with effective targeting of these CNS-type receptors in vivo. Three prototypical &#x3B1;7-selective agonists, choline, tropane, and 4OH-GTS-21, were tested, and these agents were observed to activate both fish &#x3B1;7 and &#x3B1;4&#x3B2;2 nAChR. Our data therefore indicate that while some pharmacological tools used in zebrafish may function as expected, others will not.},

Here we analyze the possibility that it is the intrinsic properties of the AChR that determine its partition into a given lipid domain. Torpedo AChR or a synthetic peptide corresponding to the AChR M4 segment (the one in closer contact with lipids) was reconstituted into "raft"-containing model membranes. The distribution of the AChR was assessed by Triton X-100 extraction in combination with fluorescence studies, and lipid analyses were performed on each sample. The influence of rapsyn, a peripheral protein involved in AChR aggregation, was studied. Raft-like domain aggregation was also studied using membranes containing the ganglioside GM1 followed by GM1 crosslinking. The gammaM4 peptide displays a marked preference for raft-like domains. In contrast, AChR alone or in the presence of rapsyn or ganglioside aggregation exhibits no such preference for raft-like domains, but it does cause a significant reduction in the total amount of these domains. The results indicate that the distribution of the AChR in lipid domains cannot be due exclusively to the intrinsic physicochemical properties of the protein and that there must be an external signal in native cell membranes that directs the AChR to a specific membrane domain.},

Undulation and peristaltic spectra display excellent agreement with data from both atomistic and coarse-grained models over all simulated length scales. Additionally, the model accurately predicts the bilayer’s response to a cylindrical protein inclusion as observed in coarse-grained simulation. This elastic response provides an explanation for gramicidin ion channel lifetime versus membrane thickness data that requires no fit constants. The physical parameters inherent to this picture may be expressed in terms of familiar material properties associated with lipid monolayers.

AChR distribution was evaluated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer efficiency between the AChR intrinsic fluorescence and Laurdan or dehydroergosterol fluorescence, and by analyzing the distribution of AChR in detergent-resistant and detergent-soluble fractions (1% Triton X-100, 4 C). bSM-induced transbilayer asymmetry or the presence of 16:0-SM and/or 18:0-SM (unlike bSM or 24:1-SM) resulted in the preferential partitioning of AChR in Lo domains, suggesting that the localization of AChR in ordered domains strongly depends on the characteristics of the host lipid membrane, and in particular on the sphingolipid composition and transbilayer asymmetry.},

Mice with genetically manipulated neuronal nAChR subunits exhibit behavioral or autonomic phenotypes. Here, we report the first model of an acquired neuronal nAChR disorder and evidence for its pertinence to paraneoplastic neurological autoimmunity. Rabbits immunized once with recombinant α3 subunit (residues 1–205) develop profound gastrointestinal hypomotility, dilated pupils with impaired light response, and grossly distended bladders. As in patients with idiopathic and paraneoplastic autoimmune autonomic neuropathy, the severity parallels serum levels of ganglionic nAChR autoantibody. Failure of neurotransmission through abdominal sympathetic ganglia, with retention of neuronal viability, confirms that the disorder is a postsynaptic channelopathy. In addition, we found ganglionic nAChR protein in small-cell carcinoma lines, identifying this cancer as a potential initiator of ganglionic nAChR autoimmunity. The data support our hypothesis that immune responses driven by distinct neuronal nAChR subtypes expressed in small-cell carcinomas account for several lung cancer–related paraneoplastic disorders affecting cholinergic systems, including autoimmune autonomic neuropathy, seizures, dementia, and movement disorders.},

Analogously, the postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor may be considered the quantum of fast chemical to electrical transduction. Our understanding of postsynaptic receptors began to develop about a hundred years ago with the demonstration that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve released acetylcholine and slowed the heart beat. During the past 50 years, advances in understanding postsynaptic receptors increased at a rapid pace, owing largely to studies of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) at the motor endplate. The endplate AChR belongs to a large superfamily of neurotransmitter receptors, called Cys-loop receptors, and has served as an exemplar receptor for probing fundamental structures and mechanisms that underlie fast synaptic transmission in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Recent studies provide an increasingly detailed picture of the structure of the AChR and the symphony of molecular motions that underpin its remarkably fast and efficient chemoelectrical transduction.},

Separation of artificial membranes into liquid-ordered (Lo) and liquid-disordered phases is regarded as a common model for this compartmentalization. However, tight lipid packing in Lo phases seems to conflict with efficient partitioning of raft-associated transmembrane (TM) proteins. To assess membrane order as a component of raft organization, we performed fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy with the membrane probes Laurdan and C-laurdan. First, we assessed lipid packing in model membranes of various compositions and found cholesterol and acyl chain dependence of membrane order. Then we probed cell membranes by using two novel systems that exhibit inducible phase separation: giant plasma membrane vesicles [Baumgart et al. (2007) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 104:3165-3170] and plasma membrane spheres. Notably, only the latter support selective inclusion of raft TM proteins with the ganglioside GM1 into one phase. We measured comparable small differences in order between the separated phases of both biomembranes. Lateral packing in the ordered phase of giant plasma membrane vesicles resembled the Lo domain of model membranes, whereas the GM1 phase in plasma membrane spheres exhibited considerably lower order, consistent with different partitioning of lipid and TM protein markers. Thus, lipid-mediated coalescence of the GM1 raft domain seems to be distinct from the formation of a Lo phase, suggesting additional interactions between proteins and lipids to be effective.},

Furthermore, the number of rapsyn-binding sites per receptor (a heteropentamer) has been controversial. Here, we show by cryoelectron tomography and subtomogram averaging of Torpedo postsynaptic membrane that receptors are connected by up to three rapsyn bridges, the minimum number required to form a 2D network. Half of the receptors belong to rapsyn-connected groups comprising between two and fourteen receptors.

We discuss the biological relevance of such disulfide bridges. Using our models, we investigate cholesterol binding to intersubunit cavities of the GABAAR transmembrane domain.

  abstract = {Emerging concepts of membrane organization point to the compartmentalization of the plasma membrane into distinct lipid microdomains. This lateral segregation within cellular membranes is based on cholesterol–sphingolipid-enriched microdomains or lipid rafts which can move laterally and assemble into large-scale domains to create plasma membrane specialized cellular structures at specific cell locations. Such domains are likely involved in the genesis of the postsynaptic specialization at the neuromuscular junction, which requires the accumulation of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), through activation of the muscle specific kinase MuSK by the neurotropic factor agrin and the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. We used C2C12 myotubes as a model system to investigate whether agrin-elicited AChR clustering correlated with lipid rafts. In a previous study, using two-photon Laurdan confocal imaging, we showed that agrin-induced AChR clusters corresponded to condensed membrane domains: the biophysical hallmark of lipid rafts [F. Stetzkowski-Marden, K. Gaus, M. Recouvreur, A. Cartaud, J. Cartaud, Agrin elicits membrane condensation at sites of acetylcholine receptor clusters in C2C12 myotubes, J. Lipid Res. 47 (2006) 2121–2133]. We further demonstrated that formation and stability of AChR clusters depend on cholesterol. We also reported that three different extraction procedures (Triton X-100, pH 11 or isotonic Ca++, Mg++ buffer) generated detergent resistant membranes (DRMs) with similar cholesterol/GM1 ganglioside content, which are enriched in several signalling postsynaptic components, notably AChR, the agrin receptor MuSK, rapsyn and syntrophin. Upon agrin engagement, actin and actin-nucleation factors such as Arp2/3 and N-WASP were transiently recovered within raft fractions suggesting that the activation by agrin can trigger actin polymerization. Taken together, the present data suggest that AChR clustering at the neuromuscular junction relies upon a mechanism of raft coalescence driven by agrin-elicited actin polymerization.},

The receptor was reconstituted into three different lipid environments, with and without neutral lipids: (1) phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine; (2) phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidic acid; and (3) phosphatidylcholine/cardiolipin. Analysis of the ion flux responses showed that: (1) all three negatively charged lipid environments gave fully functional acetylcholine receptor ion channels, provided neutral lipids were added; (2) in each lipid environment, the neutral lipids tested were functionally equivalent to cholesterol; and (3) the rate of receptor desensitization depends upon the type of neutral lipid and negatively charged phospholipid reconstituted with the receptor. The functional effects of neutral and negatively charged lipids on the acetylcholine receptor are discussed in terms of protein-lipid interactions and stabilization of protein structure by lipids.},

Particularly striking is the result that up to 40% cholesterol does not increase the bending modulus K(C) of membranes composed of phosphatidylcholine lipids with two cis monounsaturated chains, although it does have the expected stiffening effect on membranes composed of lipids with two saturated chains. The B fluctuational modulus in the smectic liquid crystal theory is obtained and used to discuss the interactions between bilayers. Our K(C) results motivate a theory of elastic moduli in the high cholesterol limit and they challenge the relevance of universality concepts. Although most of our results were obtained at 30 degrees C , additional data at other temperatures to allow consideration of a reduced temperature variable do not support universality for the effect of cholesterol on all lipid bilayers. If the concept of universality is to be valid, different numbers of saturated chains must be considered to create different universality classes. The above experimental results were obtained from analysis of x-ray scattering in the low angle and wide angle regions.},

  abstract = {Micropipette pressurization of giant bilayer vesicles was used to measure both elastic bending k(c) and area stretch K(A) moduli of fluid-phase phosphatidylcholine (PC) membranes. Twelve diacyl PCs were chosen: eight with two 18 carbon chains and degrees of unsaturation from one double bond (C18:1/0, C18:0/1) to six double bonds per lipid (diC18:3), two with short saturated carbon chains (diC13:0, diC14:0), and two with long unsaturated carbon chains (diC20:4, diC22:1). Bending moduli were derived from measurements of apparent expansion in vesicle surface area under very low tensions (0.001-0.5 mN/m), which is dominated by smoothing of thermal bending undulations. Area stretch moduli were obtained from measurements of vesicle surface expansion under high tensions (&gt;0.5 mN/m), which involve an increase in area per molecule and a small-but important-contribution from smoothing of residual thermal undulations. The direct stretch moduli varied little (&lt; +/-10%) with either chain unsaturation or length about a mean of 243 mN/m. On the other hand, the bending moduli of saturated/monounsaturated chain PCs increased progressively with chain length from 0.56 x 10(-19) J for diC13:0 to 1.2 x 10(-19) J for diC22:1. However, quite unexpectedly for longer chains, the bending moduli dropped precipitously to approximately 0.4 x 10(-19) J when two or more cis double bonds were present in a chain (C18:0/2, diC18:2, diC18:3, diC20:4). Given nearly constant area stretch moduli, the variations in bending rigidity with chain length and polyunsaturation implied significant variations in thickness. To test this hypothesis, peak-to-peak headgroup thicknesses h(pp) of bilayers were obtained from x-ray diffraction of multibilayer arrays at controlled relative humidities. For saturated/monounsaturated chain bilayers, the distances h(pp) increased smoothly from diC13:0 to diC22:1 as expected. Moreover, the distances and elastic properties correlated well with a polymer brush model of the bilayer that specifies that the elastic ratio (k(c)/K(A))(1/2) = (h(pp) - h(o))/24, where h(o) approximately 1 nm accounts for separation of the headgroup peaks from the deformable hydrocarbon region. However, the elastic ratios and thicknesses for diC18:2, diC18:3, and diC20:4 fell into a distinct group below the correlation, which showed that poly-cis unsaturated chain bilayers are thinner and more flexible than saturated/monounsaturated chain bilayers.},

  abstract = {The effects of both neutral and anionic lipids on the structure of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) have been probed using infrared difference spectroscopy. The difference between infrared spectra of the nAChR recorded using the attenuated total reflectance technique in the presence and absence of the neurotransmitter analog, carbamylcholine, exhibits a complex pattern of positive and negative bands that provides a spectral map of the structural changes that occur in the nAChR upon ligand binding and subsequent desensitization. This spectral map is essentially identical in difference spectra recorded from native, native alkaline-extracted, and affinity-purified nAChR reconstituted into either soybean asolectin or egg phosphatidylcholine membranes containing both neutral and anionic lipids. This result suggests both a similar structure of the nAChR and a similar resting to desensitized conformational change in each membrane environment. In contrast, difference spectra recorded from the nAChR reconstituted into egg phosphatidylcholine membranes lacking neutral and/or anionic lipids all exhibit an essentially identical pattern of band intensity variations, which is similar to the pattern of variations observed in difference spectra recorded in the continuous presence of the desensitizing local anesthetic, dibucaine. The difference spectra suggest that the main effect of both neutral and anionic lipids in a reconstituted egg phosphatidylcholine membrane is to help stabilize the nAChR in a resting conformation. In the absence of neutral and/or anionic lipids, the nAChR is converted into an alternate conformation that appears to be analogous to the local anesthetic-induced desensitized state. Significantly, the proportion of receptors found in the resting versus the putative desensitized state appears to be dependent upon the final lipid composition of the reconstituted membrane. A lipid-dependent modulation of the equilibrium between a channel-active resting and channel-inactive desensitized state may account for the modulations of nAChR activity that are observed in different lipid membranes.},

  abstract = {In order to investigate experimentally inaccessible, molecular-level detail regarding interleaflet interaction in membranes, we have run an extensive series of coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of phase separated lipid bilayers. The simulations are motivated by differences in lipid and cholesterol composition in the inner and outer leaflets of biological membranes. Over the past several years, this phenomenon has inspired a series of experiments in model membrane systems which have explored the effects of lipid compositional asymmetry in the two leaflets. The simulations are directed at understanding one potential consequence of compositional asymmetry, that being regions of bilayers where liquid-ordered (L(o)) domains in one leaflet are opposite liquid-disordered (L(d)) domains in the other leaflet (phase asymmetry). The simulated bilayers are of two sorts: 1) Compositionally symmetric leaflets where each of the two leaflets contains an identical, phase separated (L(o)/L(d)) mixture of cholesterol, saturated and unsaturated phospholipid; and 2) Compositionally asymmetric leaflets, where one leaflet contains a phase separated (L(o)/L(d)) mixture while the other contains only unsaturated lipid, which on its own would be in the L(d) phase. In addition, we have run simulations where the lengths of the saturated lipid chains as well as the mole ratios of the three lipid components are varied. Collectively, we report on three types of interleaflet coupling within a bilayer. First, we show the effects of compositional asymmetry on acyl chain tilt and order, lipid rotational dynamics, and lateral diffusion in regions of leaflets that are opposite L(o) domains. Second, we show substantial effects of compositional asymmetry on local bilayer curvature, with the conclusion that phase separated leaflets resist curvature, while inducing large degrees of curvature in an opposing L(d) leaflet. Finally, in compositionally symmetric, phase separated bilayers, we find phase asymmetry (domain antiregistration) between the two leaflets occurs as a consequence of mismatched acyl chain-lengths in the saturated and unsaturated lipids.},

Here we present a one-microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulation of the GLIC channel pH stimulated gating mechanism. The crystal structure of GLIC obtained at acidic pH in an open-channel form is equilibrated in a membrane environment and then instantly set to neutral pH. The simulation shows a channel closure that rapidly takes place at the level of the hydrophobic furrow and a progressively increasing quaternary twist. Two major events are captured during the simulation. They are initiated by local but large fluctuations in the pore, taking place at the top of the M2 helix, followed by a global tertiary relaxation. The two-step transition of the first subunit starts within the first 50 ns of the simulation and is followed at 450 ns by its immediate neighbor in the pentamer, which proceeds with a similar scenario. This observation suggests a possible two-step domino-like tertiary mechanism that takes place between adjacent subunits. In addition, the dynamical properties of GLIC described here offer an interpretation of the paradoxical properties of a permeable A13'F mutant whose crystal structure determined at 3.15 A shows a pore too narrow to conduct ions.},

  abstract = {Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate fast chemical neurotransmission at the neuromuscular junction and have diverse signalling roles in the central nervous system. The nicotinic receptor has been a model system for cell-surface receptors, and specifically for ligand-gated ion channels, for well over a century. In addition to the receptors’ prominent roles in the development of the fields of pharmacology and neurobiology, nicotinic receptors are important therapeutic targets for neuromuscular disease, addiction, epilepsy and for neuromuscular blocking agents used during surgery. The overall architecture of the receptor was described in landmark studies of the nicotinic receptor isolated from the electric organ of Torpedo marmorata. Structures of a soluble ligand-binding domain have provided atomic-scale insights into receptor–ligand interactions, while high-resolution structures of other members of the pentameric receptor superfamily provide touchstones for an emerging allosteric gating mechanism. All available high-resolution structures are of homopentameric receptors. However, the vast majority of pentameric receptors (called Cys-loop receptors in eukaryotes) present physiologically are heteromeric. Here we present the X-ray crystallographic structure of the human α4β2 nicotinic receptor, the most abundant nicotinic subtype in the brain. This structure provides insights into the architectural principles governing ligand recognition, heteromer assembly, ion permeation and desensitization in this prototypical receptor class.},

  abstract = {The intact Xenopus laevis oocyte is a useful model system for studying expressed water and solute transporters but suffers from a number of limitations, most notably large unstirred layers and other intracellular diffusion barriers. To overcome these, we have developed a method for isolating plasma membrane vesicles from oocytes. This approach facilitates more precise control of the intravesicular environment and virtually eliminates the problem of unstirred layers in kinetic experiments. The isolation procedure results in 50.6-fold enrichment of the plasma membrane marker alkaline phosphodiesterase compared with the homogenate. Markers of late endosomes/lysosomes and mitochondria were not enriched, and the endoplasmic reticulum was enriched only modestly. Permeabilities of native plasma membrane to water and urea were 8.1 x 10(-4) and 5.6 x 10(-7) cm/s, respectively, values that are sufficiently low to classify them as barrier membranes. Phospholipid analysis by mass spectrometry showed the membrane, not including cholesterol, to be rich in phosphatidylcholine (35.8 mole percent), sphingomyelin (25.8 mole percent), and phosphatidylinositol (6.8 mole percent). Cholesterol concentration was 20.7 mole percent. Membrane vesicles isolated from oocytes expressing aquaporin-1 exhibited fourfold higher water permeability in stopped-flow experiments. Oocytes expressing mouse urea transporter A3 (UT-A3) exhibited 7.5-fold faster phloretin-inhibitable urea transport compared with water-injected controls. There was no difference in water permeability between these membrane vesicles, suggesting that UT-A3 is not a water carrier. In conclusion, we describe an improved method for the isolation of the oocyte plasma membrane that will allow the study of water and solute transport kinetics as well as substrate selectivity in heterologously expressed proteins.},
