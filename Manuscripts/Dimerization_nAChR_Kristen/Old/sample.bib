    abstract = { The classical studies of nicotine by Langley at the turn of the 20th century introduced the concept of a “receptive substance,” from which the idea of a “receptor” came to light. Subsequent studies aided by the Torpedo electric organ, a rich source of muscle-type nicotinic receptors (nAChRs), and the discovery of α-bungarotoxin, a snake toxin that binds pseudo-irreversibly to the muscle nAChR, resulted in the muscle nAChR being the best characterized ligand-gated ion channel hitherto. With the advancement of functional and genetic studies in the late 1980s, the existence of nAChRs in the mammalian brain was confirmed and the realization that the numerous nAChR subtypes contribute to the psychoactive properties of nicotine and other drugs of abuse and to the neuropathology of various diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and schizophrenia, has since emerged. This review provides a comprehensive overview of these findings and the more recent revelations of the impact that the rich diversity in function and expression of this receptor family has on neuronal and nonneuronal cells throughout the body. Despite these numerous developments, our understanding of the contributions of specific neuronal nAChR subtypes to the many facets of physiology throughout the body remains in its infancy. }

@article{Patel2017,
abstract = {Background: $\alpha$7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are widely distributed throughout the central nervous system and are reported to have neuroprotective properties. $\alpha$7 nAChRs are expressed on astrocytes, which are key regulators of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in several neurodegenerative diseases. However, the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of astroglial $\alpha$7 nAChRs are not well studied. Therefore, we evaluated the role of astroglial $\alpha$7 nAChR activation in neuroinflammation. Methods: Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of $\alpha$7 nAChR activation were evaluated in an in vitro mouse model of neuroinflammation using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in primary astrocyte cultures. $\alpha$7 nAChR anti-inflammatory effects on the NF-$\kappa$B pathway were evaluated using ELISA, gene expression analysis, immunofluorescence, and western blotting. Antioxidant effect of $\alpha$7 nAChR activation on expression profiles of canonical Nrf2 target genes was examined by quantitative PCR and western blotting. The role of the Nrf2 pathway in $\alpha$7 nAChR-mediated anti-inflammatory response was evaluated using Nrf2 knockout astrocytes. Brain ex vivo NF-$\kappa$B luciferase signals were evaluated after treatment with an $\alpha$7 nAChR agonist in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-injected NF-$\kappa$B luciferase reporter mouse model. Results: Astrocytes treated with the $\alpha$7 nAChR partial agonist (GTS21) showed significantly reduced LPS-mediated secretion of inflammatory cytokines and this effect was reversed by the $\alpha$7 nAChR antagonist methyllycaconitine (MLA) and by knockdown of $\alpha$7 nAChR expression with a short hairpin RNA. Further, $\alpha$7 nAChR activation blocked LPS-mediated NF-$\kappa$B nuclear translocation indicating that the observed anti-inflammatory effect may be mediated through inhibition of the NF-$\kappa$B pathway. Treatment with GTS21 also upregulated canonical Nrf2 antioxidant genes and proteins suggesting antioxidant properties of $\alpha$7 nAChR in astrocytes. Using an astrocyte conditioned media approach, we demonstrated reduction in neuronal apoptosis when astrocytes were pretreated with GTS21. Finally, in an in vivo neuroinflammation model using LPS in NF-$\kappa$B luciferase reporter mice, we demonstrated reduction in LPS-induced NF-$\kappa$B activity and pro-inflammatory cytokines with GTS21 treatment in brain tissue. Conclusion: Our results suggest that activating astroglial $\alpha$7 nAChRs may have a role in neuroprotection by decreasing inflammation and oxidative stress, and therefore could have therapeutic implication for disease modifying treatments of neurodegenerative diseases.},

@article{Xiong2012,
abstract = {Certain types of nonpsychoactive cannabinoids can potentiate glycine receptors (GlyRs), an important target for nociceptive regulation at the spinal level. However, little is known about the potential and mechanism of glycinergic cannabinoids for chronic pain treatment. We report that systemic and intrathecal administration of cannabidiol (CBD), a major nonpsychoactive component of marijuana, and its modified derivatives significantly suppress chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain without causing apparent analgesic tolerance in rodents. The cannabinoids significantly potentiate glycine currents in dorsal horn neurons in rat spinal cord slices. The analgesic potency of 11 structurally similar cannabinoids is positively correlated with cannabinoid potentiation of the $\alpha$3 GlyRs. In contrast, the cannabinoid analgesia is neither correlated with their binding affinity for CB1 and CB2 receptors nor with their psychoactive side effects. NMR analysis reveals a direct interaction between CBD and S296 in the third transmembrane domain of purified $\alpha$3 GlyR. The cannabinoid-induced analgesic effect is absent in mice lacking the $\alpha$3 GlyRs. Our findings suggest that the $\alpha$3 GlyRs mediate glycinergic cannabinoid-induced suppression of chronic pain. These cannabinoids may represent a novel class of therapeutic agents for the treatment of chronic pain and other diseases involving GlyR dysfunction.},

	structurally and biochemically isolated cellular compartments to
	localize calcium-mediated events during neurotransmission. The cytoplasmic
	membrane contains lipid microdomains called lipid rafts, which can
	gather into microscopically visible clusters, and thus the association
	of a particular protein with lipid rafts can result in its redistribution
	on the cell surface. The present study asks whether lipid rafts participate
	in the formation and maintenance of the calcium-permeable alpha7-subunit
	nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7nAChR) clusters found in
	somatic spines of ciliary neurons. Lipid rafts and alpha7nAChR become
	progressively colocalized within somatic spines during synaptogenesis.
	To determine whether these rafts are required for the maintenance
	of alpha7nAChR aggregates, cholesterol was extracted from dissociated
	ciliary neurons by treatment with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin. This
	treatment caused the dispersion of lipid rafts and the redistribution
	of alpha7nAChR into small clusters over the cell surface, suggesting
	that the integrity of lipid rafts is required to maintain the receptor
	clustering. However, lipid raft dispersion also caused the depolymerization
	of the F-actin cytoskeleton, which can also tether the receptor at
	specific sites. To assess whether interaction between rafts and alpha7nAChR

	phenomenon that remains obscure is how the plasmalemma?s lipid composition
	regulates the activatable pool of membrane receptors. An outstanding
	model to study this phenomenon is the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
	(nAChR), since the nAChR activatable pool has been estimated to be
	but a small fraction of the receptors present in the plasmalemma.
	Studies on cholesterol depletion in the function of
	the Torpedo californica nAChR, using the lipid-exposed nAChR mutation
	(alphaC418W) that produces a congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS),
	demonstrated that cholesterol depletion causes a remarkable increase
	in the alphaC418W nAChR?s macroscopic current whereas not in the
	wild-type (WT). A variety of approaches were used to define the mechanism
	responsible for the cholesterol depletion mediated-increase in the
	alphaC418W nAChR?s macroscopic current. The present study suggests
	that a substantial fraction of the alphaC418W nAChRs is located in
	caveolin-1-positive domains, ?trapped? in a non-activatable state,
	and that membrane cholesterol depletion results in the relocation
	of these receptors to the activatable pool. Co-fractionation and
	co-immunoprecipitation of the alphaC418W nAChR and the membrane raft
	protein caveolin-1 (cav1) support the notion that interactions at
	lipid-exposed domains regulate the partition of the receptor into
	membrane raft microdomains. These results have potential implications
	as a novel mechanism to fine-tune cholinergic transmission in the

	as a very useful model for investigating the events associated with
	nerve impulse generation and synaptic transmission. While the physiology
	of squid giant axons has been extensively studied, very little is
	known about the distribution and function of the neurotransmitters
	and receptors that mediate inhibitory transmission at the synapses.
	In this study we investigated whether $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid
	(GABA) activates neurotransmitter receptors in stellate ganglia membranes.
	To overcome the low abundance of GABA-like mRNAs in invertebrates
	and the low expression of GABA in cephalopods, we used a two-electrode
	voltage clamp technique to determine if Xenopus laevis oocytes injected
	with cell membranes from squid stellate ganglia responded to GABA.
	Using this method, membrane patches containing proteins and ion channels
	from the squid's stellate ganglion were incorporated into the surface
	of oocytes. We demonstrated that GABA activates membrane receptors
	in cellular membranes isolated from squid stellate ganglia. Using
	the same approach, we were able to record native glutamate-evoked
	currents. The squid's GABA receptors showed an EC(50) of 98 $\mu$mol
	l(-1) to GABA and were inhibited by zinc (IC(50) = 356 $\mu$mol l(-1)).
	Interestingly, GABA receptors from the squid were only partially
	blocked by bicuculline. These results indicate that the microtransplantation
	of native cell membranes is useful to identify and characterize scarce
	membrane proteins. Moreover, our data also support the role of GABA
	as an ionotropic neurotransmitter in cephalopods, acting through
	chloride-permeable membrane receptors.},

  abstract = {Nicotine is a very widely used drug of abuse, which exerts a number
	of neurovegetative, behavioural and psychological effects by interacting
	with neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (NAChRs). These receptors
	are distributed widely in human brain and ganglia, and form a family
	of ACh-gated ion channels of different subtypes, each of which has
	a specific pharmacology and physiology. As human NAChRs have been
	implicated in a number of human central nervous system disorders
	(including the neurodegenerative Alzheimer?s disease, schizophrenia
	and epilepsy), they are suitable potential targets for rational drug
	therapy. Much of our current knowledge about the structure and function
	of NAChRs comes from studies carried out in other species, such as
	rodents and chicks, and information concerning human nicotinic receptors
	is still incomplete and scattered in the literature. Nevertheless,
	it is already evident that there are a number of differences in the
	anatomical distribution, physiology, pharmacology, and expression
	regulation of certain subtypes between the nicotinic systems of humans
	and other species. This review will attempt to survey the major achievements
	reached in the study of the structure and function of NAChRs by examining
	the molecular basis of their functional diversity viewed mainly from
	pharmacological and biochemical perspectives. It will also summarize

	Erwinia chrysanthemi (ELIC) has recently provided structural insight
	into this family of ion channels at high resolution. The structure
	shows a homo-pentameric protein with a barrel-stave architecture
	that defines an ion-conduction pore located on the fivefold axis
	of symmetry. In this structure, the wide aqueous vestibule that is
	encircled by the extracellular ligand-binding domains of the five
	subunits narrows to a discontinuous pore that spans the lipid bilayer.
	The pore is constricted by bulky hydrophobic residues towards the
	extracellular side, which probably serve as barriers that prevent
	the diffusion of ions. This interrupted pore architecture in ELIC
	thus depicts a non-conducting conformation of a pentameric ligand-gated
	ion channel, the thermodynamically stable state in the absence of
	bound ligand. As ligand binding promotes pore opening in these ion
	channels and the specific ligand for ELIC has not yet been identified,
	we have turned our attention towards a homologous protein from the
	cyanobacterium Gloebacter violaceus (GLIC). GLIC was shown to form
	proton-gated channels that are activated by a pH decrease on the
	extracellular side and that do not desensitize after activation.
	Both prokaryotic proteins, ELIC and GLIC form ion channels that are
	selective for cations over anions with poor discrimination among
	monovalent cations, characteristics that resemble the conduction
	properties of the cation-selective branch of the family that includes
	acetylcholine and serotonin receptors. Here we present the X-ray
	structure of GLIC at 3.1 A resolution. The structure reveals a conformation
	of the channel that is distinct from ELIC and that probably resembles
	the open state. In combination, both structures suggest a novel gating
	mechanism for pentameric ligand-gated ion channels where channel
	opening proceeds by a change in the tilt of the pore-forming helices.},

	analysis by mass spectrometry showed the membrane, not including
	cholesterol, to be rich in phosphatidylcholine (35.8 mole percent),
	sphingomyelin (25.8 mole percent), and phosphatidylinositol (6.8

	vesicles isolated from oocytes expressing aquaporin-1 exhibited fourfold

	urea transport compared with water-injected controls. There was no

	their prokaryotic relatives. A number of such "Cys-less" receptors

	However, pLGICs are sparsely present in unicellular taxa, suggesting
	a high rate of gene loss and a non-essential character, contrasting

	protein that plays a central role in nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
	(AChR) clustering at the neuromuscular junction. In a previous study,
	we demonstrated that rapsyn is specifically cotransported with AChR
	via post-Golgi vesicles targeted to the innervated surface of the
	Torpedo electrocyte (Marchand et al., 2000). In the present study,
	to further elucidate the mechanisms for sorting and assembly of postsynaptic
	proteins, we analyzed the dynamics of the intracellular trafficking
	of fluorescently labeled rapsyn in the transient-expressing COS-7
	cell system. Our approach was based on fluorescence, time-lapse imaging,
	and immunoelectron microscopies, as well as biochemical analyses.
	We report that newly synthesized rapsyn associates with the trans-Golgi
	network compartment and traffics via vesiculotubular organelles toward
	the cell surface of COS-7 cells. The targeting of rapsyn organelles
	appeared to be mediated by a microtubule-dependent transport. Using
	cotransfection experiments of rapsyn and AChR, we observed that these
	two molecules codistribute within distal exocytic routes and at the
	plasma membrane. Triton X-100 extraction on ice and flotation gradient
	centrifugation demonstrated that rapsyn and AChR are recovered in
	low-density fractions enriched in two rafts markers: caveolin-1 and
	flotillin-1. We propose that sorting and targeting of these two companion
	molecules are mediated by association with cholesterol-sphingolipid-enriched
	raft microdomains. Collectively, these data highlight rapsyn as an
	itinerant vesicular protein that may play a dynamic role in the sorting
	and targeting of its companion receptor to the postsynaptic membrane.
	These data also raise the interesting hypothesis of the participation
	of the raft machinery in the targeting of signaling molecules to
	synaptic sites.},

	than an inhibitor, and we identify its binding sites by photoaffinity
	labeling. TDBzl-etomidate (>10 microm) increased the submaximal response

	At higher concentrations, it inhibited the binding of the noncompetitive

	membranes (IC(50) values of 0. 8 mm). nAChR-rich membranes were photolabeled

  abstract = {The association of hemagglutinin (HA) with lipid rafts in the plasma
	membrane is an important feature of the assembly process of influenza
	virus A. Lipid rafts are thought to be small, fluctuating patches
	of membrane enriched in saturated phospholipids, sphingolipids, cholesterol
	and certain types of protein. However, raft-associating transmembrane
	(TM) proteins generally partition into Ld domains in model membranes,
	which are enriched in unsaturated lipids and depleted in saturated
	lipids and cholesterol. The reason for this apparent disparity in
	behavior is unclear, but model membranes differ from the plasma membrane
	in a number of ways. In particular, the higher protein concentration
	in the plasma membrane may influence the partitioning of membrane
	proteins for rafts. To investigate the effect of high local protein
	concentration, we have conducted coarse-grained molecular dynamics
	(CG MD) simulations of HA clusters in domain-forming bilayers. During
	the simulations, we observed a continuous increase in the proportion
	of raft-type lipids (saturated phospholipids and cholesterol) within
	the area of membrane spanned by the protein cluster. Lateral diffusion
	of unsaturated lipids was significantly attenuated within the cluster,
	while saturated lipids were relatively unaffected. On this basis,
	we suggest a possible explanation for the change in lipid distribution,
	namely that steric crowding by the slow-diffusing proteins increases
	the chemical potential for unsaturated lipids within the cluster

  abstract = {Emerging concepts of membrane organization point to the compartmentalization
	of the plasma membrane into distinct lipid microdomains. This lateral
	segregation within cellular membranes is based on cholesterol-sphingolipid-enriched
	microdomains or lipid rafts which can move laterally and assemble
	into large-scale domains to create plasma membrane specialized cellular
	structures at specific cell locations. Such domains are likely involved
	in the genesis of the postsynaptic specialization at the neuromuscular
	junction, which requires the accumulation of acetylcholine receptors
	(AChRs), through activation of the muscle specific kinase MuSK by
	the neurotropic factor agrin and the reorganization of the actin
	cytoskeleton. We used C2C12 myotubes as a model system to investigate
	whether agrin-elicited AChR clustering correlated with lipid rafts.
	In a previous study, using two-photon Laurdan confocal imaging, we
	showed that agrin-induced AChR clusters corresponded to condensed
	membrane domains: the biophysical hallmark of lipid rafts [F. Stetzkowski-Marden,
	K. Gaus, M. Recouvreur, A. Cartaud, J. Cartaud, Agrin elicits membrane
	condensation at sites of acetylcholine receptor clusters in C2C12
	myotubes, J. Lipid Res. 47 (2006) 2121-2133]. We further demonstrated
	that formation and stability of AChR clusters depend on cholesterol.
	We also reported that three different extraction procedures (Triton
	X-100, pH 11 or isotonic Ca++, Mg++ buffer) generated detergent resistant
	membranes (DRMs) with similar cholesterol/GM1 ganglioside content,
	which are enriched in several signalling postsynaptic components,
	notably AChR, the agrin receptor MuSK, rapsyn and syntrophin. Upon
	agrin engagement, actin and actin-nucleation factors such as Arp2/3
	and N-WASP were transiently recovered within raft fractions suggesting
	that the activation by agrin can trigger actin polymerization. Taken
	together, the present data suggest that AChR clustering at the neuromuscular
	junction relies upon a mechanism of raft coalescence driven by agrin-elicited
	actin polymerization. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	of rapsyn is conferred solely by its acylated N terminus, as the
	myristoylated N-terminal 15 amino acids of rapsyn are sufficient
	to target green fluorescent protein to the plasma membrane. However,
	neither N-terminal myristoylation nor the conserved N-terminal amino
	acid sequence is essential. Membrane targeting, self-association,

	of rapsyn were replaced by those of src, which also contains a consensus
	sequence for N-myristoylation, or by those of GAP43, which contains
	a palmitoylation sequence. Rapsyn1-90, containing two tetratrichopeptide
	repeats is sufficient for self-association. Rapsyn1-360, lacking
	the cysteine rich domain, clusters nAChRs, while rapsyn1-287, containing

Previous results have suggested that the regulation of β-secretase and BACE access to APP is lipid dependent, and involves lipid rafts. Using the baculovirus expression system, we have expressed recombinant human full-length BACE in insect cells and purified milligram amounts to homogeneity. We have studied partitioning of fluorophor-conjugated BACE between the liquid ordered and disordered phases in giant (10–150 μm) unilamellar vesicles, and found ∼20% to associate with the raft-like, liquid-ordered phase; the fraction associated with liquid-ordered phase increased upon cross-linking of raft lipids. To examine involvement of individual lipid species in modulating BACE activity, we have reconstituted the purified BACE in large (∼100 nm) unilamellar vesicles, and determined its specific activity in vesicles of various lipid compositions. We have identified 3 groups of lipids that stimulate proteolytic activity of BACE: 1) neutral glycosphingolipids (cerebrosides), 2) anionic glycerophospholipids, and 3) sterols (cholesterol).},

	a dynamic translocation of the AChR into lipid rafts-cholesterol

	MuSK partition into lipid rafts and requires its activation. Disruption
	of lipid rafts inhibits MuSK activation and downstream signaling

	protein necessary for AChR clustering, is located constitutively
	in lipid rafts, but its interaction with the AChR is inhibited when
	lipid rafts are perturbed. These results reveal that lipid rafts
	may regulate AChR clustering by facilitating the agrin/MuSK signaling

These channels are involved both in physiological functions (including cognition, reward, motor activity and analgesia) and in pathological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, some forms of epilepsy, depression, autism and schizophrenia. They are also the targets of tobacco-smoking effects and addiction. Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are pentamers of homomeric or heteromeric combinations of ?? (??2-??10) and ?? (??2-??4) subunits, which have different pharmacological and biophysical properties and locations in the brain. The lack of subtype-specific ligands and the fact that many neuronal cells express multiple subtypes initially hampered the identification of the different native nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes, but the increasing knowledge of subtype composition and roles will be of considerable interest for the development of new and clinically useful nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ligands. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMSs) are heterogeneous disorders in which the safety margin of neuromuscular transmission is compromised by one or more mechanisms. Specific diagnosis of a CMS is important as some medications that benefit one type of CMS can be detrimental in another type. In some CMSs, strong clinical clues point to a specific diagnosis. In other CMSs, morphologic and in vitro electrophysiologic studies of the neuromuscular junction, determination of the number of acetylcholine receptors (AchRs) per junction, and molecular genetic studies may be required for a specific diagnosis. Strategies for therapy are based on whether a given CMS decreases or increases the synaptic response to acetylcholine (ACh). Cholinesterase inhibitors that increase the synaptic response to ACh and 3,4-diaminopyridine, which increases ACh release, are useful when the synaptic response to ACh is attenuated. Long-lived open-channel blockers of the AChR, quinidine, and fluoxetine, are useful w},

Abstract = {Disorders affecting the presynaptic, synaptic, and postsynaptic portions of the neuromuscular junction arise from various mechanisms in children and adults, including acquired autoimmune or toxic processes as well as genetic mutations. Disorders include autoimmune myasthenia gravis associated with acetylcholine receptor, muscle specific kinase or Lrp4 antibodies, Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome, nerve terminal hyperexcitability syndromes, Guillain Barré syndrome, botulism, organophosphate poisoning and a number of congenital myasthenic syndromes. This review focuses on the various molecular and pathophysiological mechanisms of these disorders, characterization of which has been crucial to the development of treatment strategies specific for each pathogenic mechanism. In the future, further understanding of the underlying processes may lead to more effective and targeted therapies of these disorders.

Abstract = {Between 1940 and 2000 a total of 1976 patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) were studied. Diagnosis was made by improvement in weakness after anticholinesterase medication. The historical developments in diagnosis and treatment of MG are reviewed. We analyzed the clinical course of MG as influenced by age, gender, thymectomy, thymomectomy, and the presence of antibodies to acetylcholine receptors (AChR). The clinical course of MG was significantly influenced by age and gender, and these need special attention in managing patients. The most severe level of weakness and high mortality occurred during the first 1 to 2 years of the disease, after which many patients experienced improvement. For treating MG patients the usefulness of thymectomy remains to be proven, and novel drugs need to be developed to increase the number as well as normal functioning of the AChRs and other components of the neuromuscular system.},

Abstract = {Many congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are associated with mutations in the genes encoding the acetylcholine receptor (AChR), an oligomeric protein with the structure alpha(2)betadeltaepsilon. AChR deficiency is frequently due to homozygous or heteroallelic mutations in the AChR epsilon subunit, most of which cause truncation of the polypeptide chain and loss of surface expression of AChR. Here we identified mutations epsilon1369delG and epsilonY458X, located in the 18 amino acid epsilon subunit C-terminus that lies extracellular to the M4 transmembrane domain. We then incorporated green fluorescent protein (GFP) into the intracellular loop between M3 and M4 of mutant or wild-type epsilon subunits and expressed the AChRs in RD or HEK 293 cells. AChR containing wild-type GFP-tagged epsilon subunits were incorporated into the surface membrane, whereas the GFP-tagged AChR mutant epsilon subunits co-localized with an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker and were not expressed on the cell},

abstract="About 20 {\%} of the identified cases of congenital myasthenic syndromes are due to defects causing overstimulation of endplate ACh receptors, with consequent excessive Ca2+ entry, endplate structural damage, and impairment of the neuromuscular transmission. Overstimulation arises from extended dwelling of ACh in the synaptic cleft because of absence of acetylcholine esterase or from prolonged activation of ``slow-channel'' mutant ACh receptors. The high Ca2+ permeability of human endplate ACh receptor, recently described, likely predisposes to excitotoxic damage. The good knowledge of ACh receptor function has allowed molecular understanding of the defects introduced in channel kinetics and Ca2+ permeability by slow-channel mutations and the design of efficient therapeutic strategies. These forms of congenital myasthenic syndrome are treated by limiting ACh-induced cation entry, thus preventing endplate degeneration. Several molecules of wide clinical use, such as fluoxetine and quinidine, but also verapamil and salbutamol modulate ACh receptor kinetics and ion selectivity and may be used to lower ACh-evoked responses in these patients. In this contribution we summarize the main findings in the field.",

Abstract = {Throughout the nervous system, moment-to-moment communication relies on postsynaptic receptors to detect neurotransmitters and change the membrane potential. For the Cys-loop superfamily of receptors, recent structural data have catalysed a leap in our understanding of the three steps of chemical-to-electrical transduction: neurotransmitter binding, communication between the binding site and the barrier to ions, and opening and closing of the barrier. The emerging insights might be expected to explain how mutations of receptors cause neurological disease, but the opposite is generally true. Namely, analyses of disease-causing mutations have clarified receptor structure–function relationships as well as mechanisms governing the postsynaptic response. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Abstract = {Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMSs) stem from genetic defects in endplate (EP)-specific presynaptic, synaptic, and postsynaptic proteins. The postsynaptic CMSs identified to date stem from a deficiency or kinetic abnormality of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). All CMSs with a kinetic abnormality of AChR, as well as many CMSs with a deficiency of AChR, have been traced to mutations in AChR-subunit genes. However, in a subset of patients with EP AChR deficiency, the genetic defect has remained elusive. Rapsyn, a 43-kDa postsynaptic protein, plays an essential role in the clustering of AChR at the EP. Seven tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) of rapsyn subserve self-association, a coiled-coil domain binds to AChR, and a RING-H2 domain associates with β-dystroglycan and links rapsyn to the subsynaptic cytoskeleton. Rapsyn self-association precedes recruitment of AChR to rapsyn clusters. In four patients with EP AChR deficiency but with no mutations in AChR subunits, we identify three re},

Abstract = {Nicotinic acetylcholine, serotonin type 3, γ-amminobutyric acid type A, and glycine receptors are major players of human neuronal communication. They belong to the family of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels, sharing a highly conserved modular 3D structure. Recently, high-resolution structures of both open- and closed-pore conformations have been solved for a bacterial, an invertebrate, and a vertebrate receptor in this family. These data suggest that a common gating mechanism occurs, coupling neurotransmitter binding to pore opening, but they also pinpoint significant differences among subtypes. In this Review, we summarize the structural and functional data in light of these gating models and speculate about their mechanistic consequences on ion permeation, pathological mutations, as well as functional regulation by orthosteric and allosteric effectors.},

Abstract = {The majority of patients with myasthenia gravis (MG), an organ-specific autoimmune disease, harbor autoantibodies that attack the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR-Abs) at the neuromuscular junction of skeletal muscles, resulting in muscle weakness. Single cell manipulation technologies coupled with genetic engineering are very powerful tools to examine T cell and B cell repertoires and the dynamics of adaptive immunity. These tools have been utilized to develop mAbs in parallel with hybridomas, phage display technologies and B-cell immortalization. By applying a single cell technology and novel high-throughput cell-based binding assays, we identified peripheral B cells that produce pathogenic nAChR-Abs in patients with MG. Although anti-nAChR antibodies produced by individual peripheral B cells generally exhibited low binding affinity for the α-subunit of the nAChR and great sequence diversity, a small fraction of these antibodies bound with high affinity to native-structured n},

Abstract = {The activities of integral membrane proteins are often affected by the structures of the lipid molecules that surround them in the membrane. One important parameter is the hydrophobic thickness of the lipid bilayer, defined by the lengths of the lipid fatty acyl chains. Membrane proteins are not rigid entities, and deform to ensure good hydrophobic matching to the surrounding lipid bilayer. The structure of the lipid headgroup region is likely to be important in defining the structures of those parts of a membrane protein that are located in the lipid headgroup region. A number of examples are given where the conformation of the headgroup-embedded region of a membrane protein changes during the reaction cycle of the protein; activities of such proteins might be expected to be particularly sensitive to lipid headgroup structure. Differences in hydrogen bonding potential and hydration between the headgroups of phosphatidycholines and phosphatidylethanolamines could be important factors },

Abstract = {Micropipette pressurization of giant bilayer vesicles was used to measure both elastic bending kc and area stretch KA moduli of fluid-phase phosphatidylcholine (PC) membranes. Twelve diacyl PCs were chosen: eight with two 18 carbon chains and degrees of unsaturation from one double bond (C18:1/0, C18:0/1) to six double bonds per lipid (diC18:3), two with short saturated carbon chains (diC13:0, diC14:0), and two with long unsaturated carbon chains (diC20:4, diC22:1). Bending moduli were derived from measurements of apparent expansion in vesicle surface area under very low tensions (0.001–0.5mN/m), which is dominated by smoothing of thermal bending undulations. Area stretch moduli were obtained from measurements of vesicle surface expansion under high tensions (>0.5mN/m), which involve an increase in area per molecule and a small—but important—contribution from smoothing of residual thermal undulations. The direct stretch moduli varied little (< ±10%) with either chain unsaturation or l},

Abstract = {Introduction:The levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) and arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4n-6) are critical for the normal structure and function of the brain. Trans fatty acids (TFA) and the source of the dietary fatty acids (FA) interfere with long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) biosynthesis. Objectives:The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of TFA supplementation in diets containing different proportions of n-9, n-6, and n-3 FA on the brain FA profile, including the retention of TFA, LC-PUFA levels, and n-6/n-3 PUFA ratios. These parameters were also investigated in the liver, considering that LC-PUFA are mainly bioconverted from their dietary precursors in this tissue and transported by serum to the brain. Also, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) gene expressions were evaluated. Methods:Male CF1 mice were fed (16 weeks) diets containing different oils (olive, corn, and rapeseed) with distinct pr},

Abstract = {What distinguishes polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) from less unsaturated fatty acids is the presence of a repeating CH–CH2–CH unit that produces an extremely flexible structure rapidly isomerizing through conformational states. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) with 6 double bonds is the most extreme example. The focus of this review is the profound impact that the high disorder of DHA has on its interaction with cholesterol when the PUFA is incorporated into membrane phospholipids. Results from a battery of biophysical techniques are described. They demonstrate an aversion of DHA for the sterol that drives the lateral segregation of DHA-containing phospholipids into liquid disordered (ld) domains that are depleted in cholesterol. These domains are compositionally and organizationally the antithesis of lipid rafts, the much-studied liquid ordered (lo) domain that is enriched in predominantly saturated sphingolipids and cholesterol. We hypothesize that the introduction of DHA-rich domains},

ABSTRACT={Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a highly debilitating disease caused by progressive degeneration of motorneurons (MNs). Due to the wide variety of genes and mutations identified in ALS, a highly varied etiology could ultimately converge to produce similar clinical symptoms. A major hypothesis in ALS research is the “distal axonopathy” with pathological changes occurring at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), at very early stages of the disease, prior to MNs degeneration and onset of clinical symptoms. The NMJ is a highly specialized cholinergic synapse, allowing signaling between muscle and nerve necessary for skeletal muscle function. This nerve-muscle contact is characterized by the clustering of the collagen-tailed form of acetylcholinesterase (ColQ-AChE), together with other components of the extracellular matrix and specific key molecules in the NMJ formation. Interestingly, in addition to their cholinergic role AChE is thought to play several ‘non-classical’ roles that do not require catalytic function, most prominent among these is facilitation of neurite growth, NMJ formation and survival. In all this context, abnormalities of AChE content have been found in plasma of ALS patients, in which AChE changes maybe reflect the neuromuscular disruption. We review these findings and particularly the evidences of changes of AChE at neuromuscular synapse in the pre-symptomatic stages of ALS.}

Our results show that DHA-PE induces phase separation into a DHA rich liquid crystalline (L$\alpha$) phase and a DHA poor gel (L$\beta$′) phase at overall DHA-PE concentrations as low as 0.1 mol{\%}. In addition, we find that the structure of the L$\beta$′ phase, from which the DHA-PE molecules are largely excluded, is modified in the phase-separated state at low DHA-PE concentrations, with a decrease in bilayer thickness of 1.34 nm for 0.1 mol{\%} at room temperature, compared to pure DPPC bilayers. This result is contrary to that seen in similar studies on mono-unsaturated lipids where an increase in bilayer thickness is observed. The surprising effect of such low DHA-PE concentrations on membrane structure may be important in understanding the role of highly polyunsaturated lipids in biological membrane-based structures and similar artificial surfactant systems.},

abstract = {Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (n ACh Rs) are members of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel superfamily that play important roles in the control of neurotransmitter release in the central and peripheral nervous system. These receptors are important therapeutic targets for the development of drugs against a number of mental health disorders and for marketed smoking cessation aids. Unfortunately, drug discovery has been hampered by difficulties in obtaining sufficiently selective compounds. Together with functional complexity of the receptors, this has made it difficult to obtain drugs with sufficiently high-target to off-target affinity ratios. The recent and ongoing progress in structural studies holds promise to help understand structure-function relationships of n ACh R drugs at the atomic level. This will undoubtedly lead to the design of more efficient drugs with fewer side effects. As a high-resolution structure of a n ACh R is yet to be determined, structural studies are to a large extent based on acetylcholine-binding proteins ( ACh BPs) that despite low overall sequence identity display a high degree of conservation of overall structure and amino acids at the ligand-binding site. Further, ACh BPs reproduce relative binding affinities of ligands at n ACh Rs. Over the past decade, ACh BPs have been used extensively as models for n ACh Rs and have aided the understanding of drug receptor interactions at n ACh Rs significantly. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Serotonin type 3 (5-HT(3)) receptors are pentameric ion channels belonging to the superfamily of Cys-loop receptors. Receptor activation either leads to fast excitatory responses or modulation of neurotransmitter release depending on their neuronal localisation. 5-HT(3) receptors are known to be expressed in the central nervous system in regions involved in the vomiting reflex, processing of pain, the reward system, cognition and anxiety control. In the periphery they are present on a variety of neurons and immune cells. 5-HT(3) receptors are known to be involved in emesis, pain disorders, drug addiction, psychiatric and GI disorders. Progress in molecular genetics gives direction to personalised medical strategies for treating complex diseases such as psychiatric and functional GI disorders and unravelling individual drug responses in pharmacogenetic approaches. Here we discuss the molecular basis of 5-HT(3) receptor diversity at the DNA and protein level, of which our knowledge has greatly extended in the last decade. We also evaluate their role in health and disease and describe specific case-control studies addressing the involvement of polymorphisms of 5-HT3 subunit genes in complex disorders and responses to drugs. Furthermore, we focus on the actual state of the pharmacological knowledge concerning not only classical 5-HT(3) antagonists--the setrons--but also compounds of various substance classes targeting 5-HT(3) receptors such as anaesthetics, opioids, cannabinoids, steroids, antidepressants and antipsychotics as well as natural compounds derived from plants. This shall point to alternative treatment options modulating the 5-HT(3) receptor system and open new possibilities for drug development in the future.},

As a consequence, therapies based on the regula-tion of membrane lipid composition and structure have been recently developed. This novel field, known as Mem-brane Lipid Therapy, is growing and evolving rapidly, providing treatments that are now in use or that are being studied for their application to oncological disorders, Alzheimer's disease, spinal cord injury, stroke, diabetes, obe-sity, and neuropathic pain. This field has arisen from relevant discoveries on the behavior of membranes in recent decades, and it paves the way to adopt new approaches in modern pharmacology and nutrition. This innovative area will promote further investigation into membranes and the development of new therapies with molecules that target the cell membrane. Due to the prominent roles of membranes in the cells' physiology and the paucity of therapeutic approaches based on the regulation of the lipids they contain, it is expected that membrane lipid therapy will provide new treatments for numerous pathologies. The first on-purpose rationally designed molecule in this field, minerval, is currently being tested in clinical trials and it is expected to enter the market around 2020. However, it seems feasible that during the next few decades other membrane regulators will also be marketed for the treatment of human pathologies.},

Diagnosis of Alzheimer-type disease was based on the presence of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in post-mortem sections. Several highly significant and specific differences were observed between the two groups. Adrenic acid (22:4 n-6) was three to four times higher in the grey matter but lower in the white matter in each of the three regions in the Alzheimer brains than in the control group. These alterations were compensated by reciprocal changes in 18:0 in the grey matter and 16:1 fatty acids in the white matter. There was no significant difference in the proportion of other fatty acids, including those of the n-6 and n-3 series, in either the grey or the white matter of any of the three regions of the two groups, except for a higher proportion of 22:6 n-3 in the parietal white matter in the Alzheimer patients. There was no significant relationship between the levels of the individual fatty acids and age at death. It is suggested that the alterations in the fatty acid composition observed in the brains of Alzheimer patients may be caused by an aberration in the system by which essential fatty acids are transported into the brain},

abstract = {Fatty acid differences, including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) have been shown in the brains of Alzheimer's patients (AD) as compared with normal age-matched individuals. Furthermore, low serum DHA is a significant risk factor for the development of AD. The relative concentration of DHA and other fatty acids, however, in the plasma of AD patients compared with patients with other kinds of dementias (other dementias; OD), patients who are cognitively impaired but nondemented (CIND), or normal patients is not known. In this study we analyzed the total phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) fractions of plasma from patients diagnosed with AD, OD, or CIND and compared them with a group of elderly control subjects with normal cognitive functioning. Plasma phospholipid and PC levels of 20:5n-3, DHA, total n-3 fatty acids, and the n-3/n-6 ratio were lower in the AD, OD, and CIND groups. Plasma phospholipid 24:0 was lower in the AD, OD, and CIND groups as compared with the group of control patients, and total n-6 fatty acid levels were higher in the AD and CIND groups only. In the plasma PE fraction, levels of 20:5n-3, DHA, and the total n-3 fatty acid levels were significantly lower in the AD, OD, and CIND groups. DHA levels were lower in the lysoPC fraction of CIND individuals only. There were no other differences in the fatty acid compositions of the different phospholipid fractions. Therefore, in AD, OD, and CIND individuals, low levels of n-3 fatty acids in the plasma may be a risk factor for cognitive impairment and/or dementia. Interestingly, a decreased level of plasma DHA was not limited to the AD patients but appears to be common in cognitive impairment with aging},

abstract = {J. Neurochem. (2012) 122, 427443. Abstract Dietary lipids modify brain fatty acid profile, but evidence of their direct effect on neuronal function is sparse. The enthorinal cortex (EC) neurons connecting to the hippocampus play a critical role in learning and memory. Here, we have exposed mice to diets based on canola:soybean oils (40 : 10, g/kg) or safflower : corn oils (25 : 25, g/kg) to investigate the relationship between the lipid profile of brain fatty acids and the intrinsic properties of EC neurons. Consumption of canola : soybean oil-enriched diet led to the increase of the monounsaturated fatty acid oleic acid and to a decrease of arachidonic acid in ethanolamine glycerophospholipids of the white matter. We also found an important rise in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) within ethanolamine glycerophospholipids and phosphatidylserine of gray matter. The canola:soybean oil treatment led to a shorter duration of action potential (-21{\%}), a reduction in the duration of postsynaptic response (-21{\%}) and increased firing activity (+43{\%}). Data from additional experiments with animals fed DHA alone or DHA with canola oil suggested that dietary monounsaturated fatty acid may have contributed to these effects on EC neuron physiology. Since neuronal function within the enthorhinal-hippocampal loop is critical to learning and memory processes, the present data may provide a functional basis for the beneficial cognitive effects of canola oil-based diets.},

Proton nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry are the main analytical platforms used for metabolic profiling, enabling detection and quantitation of a wide range of compounds of particular neuro-pharmacological and physiological relevance, including neurotransmitters, secondary messengers, structural lipids, as well as their precursors, intermediates and degradation products. Metabolic profiling is therefore particularly indicated for the study of central nervous system by probing metabolic and neurochemical profiles of the healthy or diseased brain, in preclinical models or in human samples. In this review, we introduce the analytical and statistical requirements for metabolic profiling. Then, we focus on key studies in the field of metabolic profiling applied to the characterization of animal models and human samples of central nervous system disorders. We highlight the potential of metabolic profiling for pharmacological and physiological evaluation, diagnosis and drug therapy monitoring of patients affected by brain disorders. Finally, we discuss the current challenges in the field, including the development of systems biology and pharmacology strategies improving our understanding of metabolic signatures and mechanisms of central nervous system diseases.},

abstract = {$\alpha$-synuclein is a small protein abundantly expressed in the brain and located in synaptic terminals. The conversion of $\alpha$-synuclein into oligomers and fibrils is the hallmark of a range of neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. $\alpha$-synuclein is disordered in solution but can adopt an $\alpha$-helical conformation when bound to lipid membranes. This lipid-protein interaction plays an important role in its proposed biological function, i.e., synaptic plasticity, but can also entail the aggregation of the protein. Both the chemical properties of the lipids and the lipid-to-protein-ratio have been reported to modulate the aggregation propensity of $\alpha$-synuclein. In this review, the influence of changes in the nature and levels of lipids on the aggregation propensity of $\alpha$-synuclein in vivo and in vitro will be discussed within a common general framework. In particular, while biophysical measurements and kinetic analyses of the time courses of $\alpha$-synuclein aggregation in the presence of different types of lipid vesicles allow a mechanistic dissection of the influence of the lipids on $\alpha$-synuclein aggregation, biological studies of cellular and animal models of Parkinson's disease allow the determination of changes in lipid levels and properties associated with the disease.},

Therefore, measures to prevent the mani-festation, and treatments to ameliorate the symptoms, of these disorders are in high demand. Brain lipids determine the localization and function of proteins in the cell membrane of neurons. Lipids may also act as neurotransmitters or other signalling molecules. The lipid composition of the brain can be influenced by nutrition, environmental factors, and by behavioural activity. Thus, lipids represent a target for preven-tive medicine of psychiatric disorders. Here we review how brain lipids contribute to normal behaviour and to major psychiatric disorders with the focus on phospholipids/fatty acids, sphingolipids, and endo-cannabinoids. Accumulating evidence suggests a crucial role for membrane forming and signalling lipids in the brain in the etiopathologies of depression, bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, and drug addiction. Lipids also represent potential preventive interventions for these psychiatric disorders by either targeted dietary supplementation or pharmacological manipulation of lipid regulating enzymes.},

abstract = {Acetylcholine (ACh) was one of the first neurotransmitters to be discovered and is one of the most important in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS). ACh is produced by the enzyme choline acetyltransferase and its actions are mediated through two types of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) — the G protein-coupled muscarinic AChRs and the nicotinic AChRs (nAChRs). The nAChRs are ligand-gated ion channels that are present in both the PNS (at the skeletal neuromuscular junction and in the autonomic nervous system) and the CNS. They are integral membrane proteins involved in the rapid 'phasic' effects of ACh under conditions of brief release of this neurotransmitter that produce high local concentrations. nAChRs can also respond to low ACh concentrations, and are the target of tonically released ACh and of systemically applied pharmacological agents, including nicotine. Typically, activation of brain nAChRs results in enhanced release of various key neurotrans-mitters, including dopamine, serotonin, glutamate and GABA ($\gamma$-aminobutyric acid). Knowledge of the atomic structure, functional organ-ization and conformational transitions of the nAChRs has recently progressed to the extent that these recep-tors are now among the most well understood allosteric membrane proteins (that is, proteins that mediate signal transduction between topographically distinct sites, through a conformational change) 1 . This makes them an exceptional model to investigate the molecular mecha-nisms of drug–receptor interactions 2–7 . The acute effect of ACh consists of the fast opening (microsecond to milli-second range) of a cationic channel that is permeable to Na + , K + and sometimes Ca 2+ ions. Of key importance for drug design, chronic exposure to ACh or nicotinic drugs causes a gradual decrease in the rate of this ionic response (100 ms to minutes), leading to a high-affinity, desensitized, closed state of the receptor 5 . Many of the clinically used drugs that target nAChRs are administered for months, resulting in long-term changes in receptor properties and/or number. Chronic exposure to nico-tine causes a striking increase, typically by twofold, in the total number of high-affinity receptors — a process termed upregulation 8 . There is considerable interest in modulating nAChRs to treat various nervous-system disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and tobacco addiction 9–11 . This article first examines recent advances in our understanding of the assembly, activity and con-formational transitions of the nAChR 5,12 , highlighting the relevance of these discoveries to the design of novel, improved drugs that target nAChRs.

Dysfunction in the lipid homeostasis in the brain could be a risk factor for the many types of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These neurodegenerative disorders are marked by extensive neuronal apoptosis, gliosis, and alteration in the differentiation, proliferation, and development of neurons. Sphingomyelin, a constituent of plasma membrane, as well as its primary metabolite ceramide acts as a potential lipid second messenger molecule linked with the modulation of various cellular signaling pathways. Excessive production of reactive oxygen species associated with enhanced oxidative stress has been implicated with these molecules and involved in the regulation of a variety of different neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders. Studies have shown that alterations in the levels of plasma lipid/cholesterol concentration may result to neurodegenerative diseases. Alteration in the levels of inflammatory cytokines and mediators in the brain has also been found to be implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. Although several mechanisms involved in neuronal apoptosis have been described, the molecular mechanisms underlying the correlation between lipid metabolism and the neurological deficits are not clearly understood. In the present review, an attempt has been made to provide detailed information about the association of lipids in neurodegeneration especially in Alzheimer's disease.},

Its transmembrane domain is the target for many modulators, including endogenous brain neurosteroids that impact anxiety, stress and depression, and for therapeutic drugs, such as general anesthetics. Understanding the basis for the modulation of GABAAR function requires high-resolution structures. Here we present the first atomic structures of a GABAAR chimera at 2.8-{\AA} resolution, including those bound with potentiating and inhibitory neurosteroids. These structures define new allosteric binding sites for these modulators that are associated with the $\alpha$-subunit transmembrane domain.

abstract = {Membrane lipids are potent modulators of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) from Torpedo. Lipids influence nAChR function by both conformational selection and kinetic mechanisms, stabilizing varying proportions of activatable versus non-activatable conformations, as well as influencing the transitions between these conformational States. Of note, some membranes stabilize an electrically silent uncoupled conformation that binds agonist but does not undergo agonist-induced conformational transitions. The uncoupled nAChR, however, does transition to activatable conformations in relatively thick lipid bilayers, such as those found in lipid rafts. In this review, we discuss current understanding of lipid-nAChR interactions in the context of increasingly available high resolution structural and functional data. These data highlight different sites of lipid action, including the lipid-exposed M4 transmembrane $\alpha$-helix. Current evidence suggests that lipids alter nAChR function by modulating interactions between M4 and the adjacent transmembrane $\alpha$-helices, M1 and M3. These interactions have also been implicated in both the folding and trafficking of nAChRs to the cell surface. We review current mechanistic understanding of lipid-nAChR interactions, and highlight potential biological roles for lipid-nAChR interactions in modulating the synaptic response.

abstract = {Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) play a central role in intercellular communication in the nervous system and are involved in fundamental processes such as attention, learning, and memory. They are oligomeric protein assemblies that convert a chemical signal into an ion flux through the postsynaptic membrane, but the molecular mechanism of gating ions has remained elusive. Here, we present atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of the prokaryotic channels from Gloeobacter violaceus (GLIC) and Erwinia chrysanthemi (ELIC), whose crystal structures are thought to represent the active and the resting states of pLGICs, respectively, and of the eukaryotic glutamate-gated chloride channel from Caenorhabditis elegans (GluCl), whose open-channel structure was determined complexed with the positive allosteric modulator ivermectin. Structural observables extracted from the trajectories of GLIC and ELIC are used as progress variables to analyze the time evolution of GluCl, which was simulated in the absence of ivermectin starting from the structure with bound ivermectin. The trajectory of GluCl with ivermectin removed shows a sequence of structural events that couple agonist unbinding from the extracellular domain to ion-pore closing in the transmembrane domain. Based on these results, we propose a structural mechanism for the allosteric communication leading to deactivation/activation of the GluCl channel. This model of gating emphasizes the coupling between the quaternary twisting and the opening/closing of the ion pore and is likely to apply to other members of the pLGIC family.},

  abstract={Lipid rafts are subdomains of the plasma membrane that contain high concentrations of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids. They exist as distinct liquid-ordered regions of the membrane that are resistant to extraction with nonionic detergents. Rafts appear to be small in size, but may constitute a relatively large fraction of the plasma membrane. While rafts have a distinctive protein and lipid composition, all rafts do not appear to be identical in terms of either the proteins or the lipids that they contain. A variety of proteins, especially those involved in cell signaling, have been shown to partition into lipid rafts. As a result, lipid rafts are thought to be involved in the regulation of signal transduction. Experimental evidence suggests that there are probably several different mechanisms through which rafts control cell signaling. For example, rafts may contain incomplete signaling pathways that are activated when a receptor or other required molecule is recruited into the raft. Rafts may also be important in limiting signaling, either by physical sequestration of signaling components to block nonspecific interactions, or by suppressing the intrinsic activity of signaling proteins present within rafts. This review provides an overview of the physical characteristics of lipid rafts and summarizes studies that have helped to elucidate the role of lipid rafts in signaling via receptor tyrosine kinases and G protein-coupled receptors.},

Analysis of the gangliosides by thin-layer chromatography showed that there was no selective enrichment of any individual type in the plasma membranes in relation to total brain. The major phospholipids were ethanolamine (34.2 {\%}), choline (41.6 {\%}) and serine (13.2 {\%}) phosphoglycerides. Inositol monophospho-glyceride (3.5 {\%}), sphingomyelin (5.1 {\%}) and lysolecithin (1.0 {\%}) were relatively minor components while phosphatidylglycerol was not present. Each phospholipid class showed a specific fatty acid composition which differed from that of the other phospholipids. This result extends the specific fatty acid compositions observed in grey matter and certain sub-fractions by other workers. In particular, choline phos-phoglycerides contained high levels of saturated fatty acids while large quantities of docosahexaenoic acid were present in ethanolamine and serine phosphoglycerides.},

  abstract={Cell membranes contain a large number of different lipid species. Such a multicomponent mixture exhibits a complex phase behavior with regions of structural and compositional heterogeneity. Especially domains formed in ternary mixtures, composed of saturated and unsaturated lipids together with cholesterol, have received a lot of attention as they may resemble raft formation in real cells. Here we apply a simulation model to assess the molecular nature of these domains at the nanoscale, information that has thus far eluded experimental determination. We are able to show the spontaneous separation of a saturated phosphatidylcholine {(PC)/unsaturated} {PC/cholesterol} mixture into a liquid-ordered and a liquid-disordered phase with structural and dynamic properties closely matching experimental data. The near-atomic resolution of the simulations reveals remarkable features of both domains and the boundary domain interface. Furthermore, we predict the existence of a small surface tension between the monolayer leaflets that drives registration of the domains. At the level of molecular detail, raft-like lipid mixtures show a surprising face with possible implications for many cell membrane processes.},

J Mol Biol 346:967-989]. Purified {nAChR} must be reconstituted in a mixture containing cholesterol to function. Proposed modes of interaction between cholesterol and the protein range from specific binding to indirect membrane-mediated mechanisms. However, the underlying cause of {nAChR} sensitivity to cholesterol remains controversial, in part because the vast majority of functional studies were conducted before a medium resolution structure was reported. We show that the {nAChR} contains internal sites capable of containing cholesterol, whose occupation stabilizes the protein structure. We detect sites at the protein-lipid interface as conventionally predicted from functional data, as well as deeply buried sites that are not usually considered. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that occupation of both superficial and deeply buried sites most effectively preserves the experimental structure; the structure collapses in the absence of bound cholesterol. In particular, we find that bound cholesterol directly supports contacts between the agonist-binding domain and the pore that are thought to be essential for activation of the receptor. These results likely apply to those other ion channels within the Cys-loop superfamily that depend on cholesterol, such as the {GABA} receptor.},

In giant unilamellar vesicles {(GUVs)} prepared from ternary mixtures of dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine/sphingomyelin/cholesterol, a clear separation of liquid-disordered and sphingomyelin-enriched, liquid-ordered phases could be observed. This phase separation can lead to the fission of the liquid-ordered phase from the vesicle. Here we show that in cholesterol-containing {GUVs,} the phase separation can involve dynamic redistribution of lipids from one phase into another as a result of a cross-linking perturbation. We found that the molecular structure of a sterol used for the preparation of {GUVs} determines (i) its ability to induce phase separation and (ii) the curvature (positive or negative) of the formed liquid-ordered phase. As a consequence, the latter can pinch off to the outside or inside of the vesicle. Remarkably, some mixtures of sterols induce liquid-ordered domains exhibiting both positive and negative curvature, which can lead to a new type of budding behavior in {GUVs.} Our findings could have implications for the role of sterols in various cell-biological processes such as budding of secretory vesicles, endocytosis, or formation of multivesicular bodies.},

These results identify for the first time a single intrasubunit propofol binding site in the {nAChR} transmembrane domain and suggest that this is the functionally relevant inhibitory binding site.},

In the present study, the effects of various concentrations of ethanol (1–250 {mM)} on the lipid composition after the first 6 days of Xenopus embryo development were investigated, using an in vitro fertilization technique. Lipid analysis revealed: (1) a decrease of the cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio mainly derived from a higher content of phospholipids; (2) an increase of phospholipid unsaturated fatty acids, especially C20:4 and C20:5, with ethanol concentration of 150–250 {mM;} (3) a decrease of lipid-bound sialic acid with ethanol concentrations of ≥5 {mM.} These results underline that sialoglycoconjugates are a more sensitive target of alcohol in comparison with other lipid components. The cultured embryo method certainly represents a useful model for investigation of the direct effects of ethanol on lipid metabolism, excluding maternal interference which can lead to misinterpretation of data.},

  abstract={Phase separation in biological membranes plays an important role in protein targeting and transmembrane signaling. Its occurrence in both membrane leaflets commonly gives rise to matching liquid or liquid-ordered domains in the opposing monolayers. The underlying mechanism of such co-localization is not fully understood. The decrease of the line tension around the thicker ordered domain constitutes an important driving force. Yet, robust domain coupling requires an additional energy source, which we have now identified as thermal undulations. Our theoretical analysis of elastic deformations in a lipid bilayer shows that stiffer lipid domains tend to distribute into areas with lower fluctuations of monolayer curvature. These areas naturally align in the opposing monolayers. Thus, coupling requires both membrane leafs to display a heterogeneity in splay rigidities. The heterogeneity may either originate from intrinsic lipid properties or be acquired by adsorption of peripheral molecules. Undulations and line tension act synergistically: the gain in energy due a minimized line tension is proportional to domain radius and thus primarily fuels the registration of smaller domains; whereas the energetic contribution of undulations increases with membrane area and thus primarily acts to coalesce larger domains.},

We have cloned the zebrafish nicotinic acetylcholine receptor {(nAChR)} subunits and expressed key {nAChR} subtypes in Xenopus oocytes including neuronal {(\&\#x3B1;4\&\#x3B2;2,} {\&\#x3B1;2\&\#x3B2;2,} {\&\#x3B1;3\&\#x3B2;4,} and {\&\#x3B1;7)} and muscle {(\&\#x3B1;1\&\#x3B2;1(b)\&\#x25B;\&\#x3B4;)} {nAChR.} Consistent with studies of mammalian {nAChR,} nicotine was relatively inactive on muscle-type receptors, having both low potency and efficacy. It had high efficacy but low potency for {\&\#x3B1;7} receptors, and the best potency and good efficacy for {\&\#x3B1;4\&\#x3B2;2} receptors. Cytisine, a key lead compound for the development of smoking cessation agents, is a full agonist for both mammalian {\&\#x3B1;7} and {\&\#x3B1;3\&\#x3B2;4} receptors, but a full agonist only for the fish {\&\#x3B1;7,} with surprisingly low efficacy for {\&\#x3B1;3\&\#x3B2;4.} The efficacy of cytisine for {\&\#x3B1;4\&\#x3B2;2} was somewhat greater than typically reported for mammalian {\&\#x3B1;4\&\#x3B2;2.} The ganglionic blocker mecamylamine was most potent for blocking {\&\#x3B1;3\&\#x3B2;4} receptors, least potent for {\&\#x3B1;7,} and roughly equipotent for the muscle receptors and the {\&\#x3B2;2-containing} {nAChR.} However, the block of {\&\#x3B2;2-containing} receptors was slowly reversible, consistent with effective targeting of these {CNS-type} receptors in vivo. Three prototypical {\&\#x3B1;7-selective} agonists, choline, tropane, and {4OH-GTS-21,} were tested, and these agents were observed to activate both fish {\&\#x3B1;7} and {\&\#x3B1;4\&\#x3B2;2} {nAChR.} Our data therefore indicate that while some pharmacological tools used in zebrafish may function as expected, others will not.},

  abstract={The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor {(AChR)} is in intimate contact with the lipids in its native membrane. Here we analyze the possibility that it is the intrinsic properties of the {AChR} that determine its partition into a given lipid domain. Torpedo {AChR} or a synthetic peptide corresponding to the {AChR} M4 segment (the one in closer contact with lipids) was reconstituted into "raft"-containing model membranes. The distribution of the {AChR} was assessed by Triton X-100 extraction in combination with fluorescence studies, and lipid analyses were performed on each sample. The influence of rapsyn, a peripheral protein involved in {AChR} aggregation, was studied. Raft-like domain aggregation was also studied using membranes containing the ganglioside {GM1} followed by {GM1} crosslinking. The {gammaM4} peptide displays a marked preference for raft-like domains. In contrast, {AChR} alone or in the presence of rapsyn or ganglioside aggregation exhibits no such preference for raft-like domains, but it does cause a significant reduction in the total amount of these domains. The results indicate that the distribution of the {AChR} in lipid domains cannot be due exclusively to the intrinsic physicochemical properties of the protein and that there must be an external signal in native cell membranes that directs the {AChR} to a specific membrane domain.},

The model implies continuous functional forms for thermal undulation and peristaltic amplitudes as a function of wavelength and predicts previously overlooked relationships between these curves. Undulation and peristaltic spectra display excellent agreement with data from both atomistic and coarse-grained models over all simulated length scales. Additionally, the model accurately predicts the bilayer’s response to a cylindrical protein inclusion as observed in coarse-grained simulation. This elastic response provides an explanation for gramicidin ion channel lifetime versus membrane thickness data that requires no fit constants. The physical parameters inherent to this picture may be expressed in terms of familiar material properties associated with lipid monolayers. Inclusion of a finite monolayer spontaneous curvature is essential to obtain fully consistent agreement between theory and the full range of available simulation/experimental data.},

Here, we have furthered our studies by characterizing the influence of different lipid host compositions on the distribution of purified {AChR} reconstituted in two model systems {(POPC:Chol,} 1:1 and {POPC:Chol:SM,} 1:1:1), involving a) different {SM} species (porcine brain {SM} {(bSM),} {16:0-SM,} {18:0-SM} or {24:1-SM);} or b) induced transbilayer asymmetry, resulting from enrichment in {bSM} in the external hemilayer. {AChR} distribution was evaluated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer efficiency between the {AChR} intrinsic fluorescence and Laurdan or dehydroergosterol fluorescence, and by analyzing the distribution of {AChR} in detergent-resistant and detergent-soluble fractions (1\% Triton X-100, 4~{{\textdegree}C).} {bSM-induced} transbilayer asymmetry or the presence of {16:0-SM} and/or {18:0-SM} (unlike {bSM} or {24:1-SM)} resulted in the preferential partitioning of {AChR} in Lo domains, suggesting that the localization of {AChR} in ordered domains strongly depends on the characteristics of the host lipid membrane, and in particular on the sphingolipid composition and transbilayer asymmetry.},

  abstract={Neuronal nicotinic {AChRs} {(nAChRs)} are implicated in the pathogenesis of diverse neurological disorders and in the regulation of small-cell lung carcinoma growth. Twelve subunits have been identified in vertebrates, and mutations of one are recognized in a rare form of human epilepsy. Mice with genetically manipulated neuronal {nAChR} subunits exhibit behavioral or autonomic phenotypes. Here, we report the first model of an acquired neuronal {nAChR} disorder and evidence for its pertinence to paraneoplastic neurological autoimmunity. Rabbits immunized once with recombinant α3 subunit (residues 1–205) develop profound gastrointestinal hypomotility, dilated pupils with impaired light response, and grossly distended bladders. As in patients with idiopathic and paraneoplastic autoimmune autonomic neuropathy, the severity parallels serum levels of ganglionic {nAChR} autoantibody. Failure of neurotransmission through abdominal sympathetic ganglia, with retention of neuronal viability, confirms that the disorder is a postsynaptic channelopathy. In addition, we found ganglionic {nAChR} protein in small-cell carcinoma lines, identifying this cancer as a potential initiator of ganglionic {nAChR} autoimmunity. The data support our hypothesis that immune responses driven by distinct neuronal {nAChR} subtypes expressed in small-cell carcinomas account for several lung cancer–related paraneoplastic disorders affecting cholinergic systems, including autoimmune autonomic neuropathy, seizures, dementia, and movement disorders.},

Analogously, the postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor may be considered the quantum of fast chemical to electrical transduction. Our understanding of postsynaptic receptors began to develop about a hundred years ago with the demonstration that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve released acetylcholine and slowed the heart beat. During the past 50 years, advances in understanding postsynaptic receptors increased at a rapid pace, owing largely to studies of the acetylcholine receptor {(AChR)} at the motor endplate. The endplate {AChR} belongs to a large superfamily of neurotransmitter receptors, called Cys-loop receptors, and has served as an exemplar receptor for probing fundamental structures and mechanisms that underlie fast synaptic transmission in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Recent studies provide an increasingly detailed picture of the structure of the {AChR} and the symphony of molecular motions that underpin its remarkably fast and efficient chemoelectrical transduction.},

  abstract={Lipid rafts are nanoscopic assemblies of sphingolipids, cholesterol, and specific membrane proteins that contribute to lateral heterogeneity in eukaryotic membranes. Separation of artificial membranes into liquid-ordered {(Lo)} and liquid-disordered phases is regarded as a common model for this compartmentalization. However, tight lipid packing in Lo phases seems to conflict with efficient partitioning of raft-associated transmembrane {(TM)} proteins. To assess membrane order as a component of raft organization, we performed fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy with the membrane probes Laurdan and C-laurdan. First, we assessed lipid packing in model membranes of various compositions and found cholesterol and acyl chain dependence of membrane order. Then we probed cell membranes by using two novel systems that exhibit inducible phase separation: giant plasma membrane vesicles {[Baumgart} et al. (2007) Proc Natl Acad Sci {USA} 104:3165-3170] and plasma membrane spheres. Notably, only the latter support selective inclusion of raft {TM} proteins with the ganglioside {GM1} into one phase. We measured comparable small differences in order between the separated phases of both biomembranes. Lateral packing in the ordered phase of giant plasma membrane vesicles resembled the Lo domain of model membranes, whereas the {GM1} phase in plasma membrane spheres exhibited considerably lower order, consistent with different partitioning of lipid and {TM} protein markers. Thus, lipid-mediated coalescence of the {GM1} raft domain seems to be distinct from the formation of a Lo phase, suggesting additional interactions between proteins and lipids to be effective.},

However, the detailed organization of the receptor-rapsyn network is poorly understood: it is unclear whether rapsyn first forms a wide meshwork to which receptors can subsequently dock or whether it only forms short bridges linking receptors together to make a large cluster. Furthermore, the number of rapsyn-binding sites per receptor (a heteropentamer) has been controversial. Here, we show by cryoelectron tomography and subtomogram averaging of Torpedo postsynaptic membrane that receptors are connected by up to three rapsyn bridges, the minimum number required to form a {2D} network. Half of the receptors belong to rapsyn-connected groups comprising between two and fourteen receptors. Our results provide a structural basis for explaining the stability and low diffusion of receptors within clusters.},

The models show the possibility of previously unreported disulfide bridges linking the M1 and M3 transmembrane helices in the {\&\#x3B1;} and {\&\#x3B3;} subunits. We discuss the biological relevance of such disulfide bridges. Using our models, we investigate cholesterol binding to intersubunit cavities of the {GABAAR} transmembrane domain. We find that very similar binding modes are predicted independently by three approaches: analogy with ivermectin in the {GluCl} crystal structure, automated docking by {AutoDock,} and spontaneous rebinding events in unbiased molecular dynamics simulations. Taken together, the models and atomistic simulations suggest a somewhat flexible binding mode, with several possible orientations. Finally, we explore the possibility that cholesterol promotes pore opening through a wedge mechanism.},

  number={1-3},
  abstract={Emerging concepts of membrane organization point to the compartmentalization of the plasma membrane into distinct lipid microdomains. This lateral segregation within cellular membranes is based on cholesterol–sphingolipid-enriched microdomains or lipid rafts which can move laterally and assemble into large-scale domains to create plasma membrane specialized cellular structures at specific cell locations. Such domains are likely involved in the genesis of the postsynaptic specialization at the neuromuscular junction, which requires the accumulation of acetylcholine receptors {(AChRs),} through activation of the muscle specific kinase {MuSK} by the neurotropic factor agrin and the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. We used {C2C12} myotubes as a model system to investigate whether agrin-elicited {AChR} clustering correlated with lipid rafts. In a previous study, using two-photon Laurdan confocal imaging, we showed that agrin-induced {AChR} clusters corresponded to condensed membrane domains: the biophysical hallmark of lipid rafts {[F.} {Stetzkowski-Marden,} K. Gaus, M. Recouvreur, A. Cartaud, J. Cartaud, Agrin elicits membrane condensation at sites of acetylcholine receptor clusters in {C2C12} myotubes, J. Lipid Res. 47 (2006) 2121–2133]. We further demonstrated that formation and stability of {AChR} clusters depend on cholesterol. We also reported that three different extraction procedures {(Triton} X-100, {pH} 11 or isotonic Ca++, Mg++ buffer) generated detergent resistant membranes {(DRMs)} with similar {cholesterol/GM1} ganglioside content, which are enriched in several signalling postsynaptic components, notably {AChR,} the agrin receptor {MuSK,} rapsyn and syntrophin. Upon agrin engagement, actin and actin-nucleation factors such as Arp2/3 and {N-WASP} were transiently recovered within raft fractions suggesting that the activation by agrin can trigger actin polymerization. Taken together, the present data suggest that {AChR} clustering at the neuromuscular junction relies upon a mechanism of raft coalescence driven by agrin-elicited actin polymerization.},

  abstract={The effects of cholesterol on membrane bending modulus {K(C),} membrane thickness {D(HH),} the partial and apparent areas of cholesterol and lipid, and the order parameter S(xray) are shown to depend upon the number of saturated hydrocarbon chains in the lipid molecules. Particularly striking is the result that up to 40\% cholesterol does not increase the bending modulus {K(C)} of membranes composed of phosphatidylcholine lipids with two cis monounsaturated chains, although it does have the expected stiffening effect on membranes composed of lipids with two saturated chains. The B fluctuational modulus in the smectic liquid crystal theory is obtained and used to discuss the interactions between bilayers. Our {K(C)} results motivate a theory of elastic moduli in the high cholesterol limit and they challenge the relevance of universality concepts. Although most of our results were obtained at 30 degrees C , additional data at other temperatures to allow consideration of a reduced temperature variable do not support universality for the effect of cholesterol on all lipid bilayers. If the concept of universality is to be valid, different numbers of saturated chains must be considered to create different universality classes. The above experimental results were obtained from analysis of x-ray scattering in the low angle and wide angle regions.},

  abstract={Micropipette pressurization of giant bilayer vesicles was used to measure both elastic bending k(c) and area stretch {K(A)} moduli of fluid-phase phosphatidylcholine {(PC)} membranes. Twelve diacyl {PCs} were chosen: eight with two 18 carbon chains and degrees of unsaturation from one double bond {(C18:1/0,} C18:0/1) to six double bonds per lipid {(diC18:3),} two with short saturated carbon chains {(diC13:0,} {diC14:0),} and two with long unsaturated carbon chains {(diC20:4,} {diC22:1).} Bending moduli were derived from measurements of apparent expansion in vesicle surface area under very low tensions (0.001-0.5 {mN/m),} which is dominated by smoothing of thermal bending undulations. Area stretch moduli were obtained from measurements of vesicle surface expansion under high tensions (\&gt;0.5 {mN/m),} which involve an increase in area per molecule and a small-but important-contribution from smoothing of residual thermal undulations. The direct stretch moduli varied little (\&lt; +/-10\%) with either chain unsaturation or length about a mean of 243 {mN/m.} On the other hand, the bending moduli of saturated/monounsaturated chain {PCs} increased progressively with chain length from 0.56 x 10(-19) J for {diC13:0} to 1.2 x 10(-19) J for {diC22:1.} However, quite unexpectedly for longer chains, the bending moduli dropped precipitously to approximately 0.4 x 10(-19) J when two or more cis double bonds were present in a chain {(C18:0/2,} {diC18:2,} {diC18:3,} {diC20:4).} Given nearly constant area stretch moduli, the variations in bending rigidity with chain length and polyunsaturation implied significant variations in thickness. To test this hypothesis, peak-to-peak headgroup thicknesses h(pp) of bilayers were obtained from x-ray diffraction of multibilayer arrays at controlled relative humidities. For saturated/monounsaturated chain bilayers, the distances h(pp) increased smoothly from {diC13:0} to {diC22:1} as expected. Moreover, the distances and elastic properties correlated well with a polymer brush model of the bilayer that specifies that the elastic ratio {(k(c)/K(A))(1/2)} = (h(pp) - h(o))/24, where h(o) approximately 1 nm accounts for separation of the headgroup peaks from the deformable hydrocarbon region. However, the elastic ratios and thicknesses for {diC18:2,} {diC18:3,} and {diC20:4} fell into a distinct group below the correlation, which showed that poly-cis unsaturated chain bilayers are thinner and more flexible than saturated/monounsaturated chain bilayers.},

  abstract={The effects of both neutral and anionic lipids on the structure of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor {(nAChR)} have been probed using infrared difference spectroscopy. The difference between infrared spectra of the {nAChR} recorded using the attenuated total reflectance technique in the presence and absence of the neurotransmitter analog, carbamylcholine, exhibits a complex pattern of positive and negative bands that provides a spectral map of the structural changes that occur in the {nAChR} upon ligand binding and subsequent desensitization. This spectral map is essentially identical in difference spectra recorded from native, native alkaline-extracted, and affinity-purified {nAChR} reconstituted into either soybean asolectin or egg phosphatidylcholine membranes containing both neutral and anionic lipids. This result suggests both a similar structure of the {nAChR} and a similar resting to desensitized conformational change in each membrane environment. In contrast, difference spectra recorded from the {nAChR} reconstituted into egg phosphatidylcholine membranes lacking neutral and/or anionic lipids all exhibit an essentially identical pattern of band intensity variations, which is similar to the pattern of variations observed in difference spectra recorded in the continuous presence of the desensitizing local anesthetic, dibucaine. The difference spectra suggest that the main effect of both neutral and anionic lipids in a reconstituted egg phosphatidylcholine membrane is to help stabilize the {nAChR} in a resting conformation. In the absence of neutral and/or anionic lipids, the {nAChR} is converted into an alternate conformation that appears to be analogous to the local anesthetic-induced desensitized state. Significantly, the proportion of receptors found in the resting versus the putative desensitized state appears to be dependent upon the final lipid composition of the reconstituted membrane. A lipid-dependent modulation of the equilibrium between a channel-active resting and channel-inactive desensitized state may account for the modulations of {nAChR} activity that are observed in different lipid membranes.},

  abstract={In order to investigate experimentally inaccessible, molecular-level detail regarding interleaflet interaction in membranes, we have run an extensive series of coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of phase separated lipid bilayers. The simulations are motivated by differences in lipid and cholesterol composition in the inner and outer leaflets of biological membranes. Over the past several years, this phenomenon has inspired a series of experiments in model membrane systems which have explored the effects of lipid compositional asymmetry in the two leaflets. The simulations are directed at understanding one potential consequence of compositional asymmetry, that being regions of bilayers where liquid-ordered {(L(o))} domains in one leaflet are opposite liquid-disordered {(L(d))} domains in the other leaflet (phase asymmetry). The simulated bilayers are of two sorts: 1) Compositionally symmetric leaflets where each of the two leaflets contains an identical, phase separated {(L(o)/L(d))} mixture of cholesterol, saturated and unsaturated phospholipid; and 2) Compositionally asymmetric leaflets, where one leaflet contains a phase separated {(L(o)/L(d))} mixture while the other contains only unsaturated lipid, which on its own would be in the L(d) phase. In addition, we have run simulations where the lengths of the saturated lipid chains as well as the mole ratios of the three lipid components are varied. Collectively, we report on three types of interleaflet coupling within a bilayer. First, we show the effects of compositional asymmetry on acyl chain tilt and order, lipid rotational dynamics, and lateral diffusion in regions of leaflets that are opposite L(o) domains. Second, we show substantial effects of compositional asymmetry on local bilayer curvature, with the conclusion that phase separated leaflets resist curvature, while inducing large degrees of curvature in an opposing L(d) leaflet. Finally, in compositionally symmetric, phase separated bilayers, we find phase asymmetry (domain antiregistration) between the two leaflets occurs as a consequence of mismatched acyl chain-lengths in the saturated and unsaturated lipids.},

  abstract={Recently discovered bacterial homologues of eukaryotic pentameric ligand-gated ion channels, such as the Gloeobacter violaceus receptor {(GLIC),} are increasingly used as structural and functional models of signal transduction in the nervous system. Here we present a one-microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulation of the {GLIC} channel {pH} stimulated gating mechanism. The crystal structure of {GLIC} obtained at acidic {pH} in an open-channel form is equilibrated in a membrane environment and then instantly set to neutral {pH.} The simulation shows a channel closure that rapidly takes place at the level of the hydrophobic furrow and a progressively increasing quaternary twist. Two major events are captured during the simulation. They are initiated by local but large fluctuations in the pore, taking place at the top of the M2 helix, followed by a global tertiary relaxation. The two-step transition of the first subunit starts within the first 50 ns of the simulation and is followed at 450 ns by its immediate neighbor in the pentamer, which proceeds with a similar scenario. This observation suggests a possible two-step domino-like tertiary mechanism that takes place between adjacent subunits. In addition, the dynamical properties of {GLIC} described here offer an interpretation of the paradoxical properties of a permeable {A13'F} mutant whose crystal structure determined at 3.15 A shows a pore too narrow to conduct ions.},

  abstract={Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate fast chemical neurotransmission at the neuromuscular junction and have diverse signalling roles in the central nervous system. The nicotinic receptor has been a model system for cell-surface receptors, and specifically for ligand-gated ion channels, for well over a century. In addition to the receptors’ prominent roles in the development of the fields of pharmacology and neurobiology, nicotinic receptors are important therapeutic targets for neuromuscular disease, addiction, epilepsy and for neuromuscular blocking agents used during surgery. The overall architecture of the receptor was described in landmark studies of the nicotinic receptor isolated from the electric organ of Torpedo marmorata. Structures of a soluble ligand-binding domain have provided atomic-scale insights into receptor–ligand interactions, while high-resolution structures of other members of the pentameric receptor superfamily provide touchstones for an emerging allosteric gating mechanism. All available high-resolution structures are of homopentameric receptors. However, the vast majority of pentameric receptors (called Cys-loop receptors in eukaryotes) present physiologically are heteromeric. Here we present the X-ray crystallographic structure of the human α4β2 nicotinic receptor, the most abundant nicotinic subtype in the brain. This structure provides insights into the architectural principles governing ligand recognition, heteromer assembly, ion permeation and desensitization in this prototypical receptor class.},

  abstract={The intact Xenopus laevis oocyte is a useful model system for studying expressed water and solute transporters but suffers from a number of limitations, most notably large unstirred layers and other intracellular diffusion barriers. To overcome these, we have developed a method for isolating plasma membrane vesicles from oocytes. This approach facilitates more precise control of the intravesicular environment and virtually eliminates the problem of unstirred layers in kinetic experiments. The isolation procedure results in 50.6-fold enrichment of the plasma membrane marker alkaline phosphodiesterase compared with the homogenate. Markers of late endosomes/lysosomes and mitochondria were not enriched, and the endoplasmic reticulum was enriched only modestly. Permeabilities of native plasma membrane to water and urea were 8.1 x 10(-4) and 5.6 x 10(-7) cm/s, respectively, values that are sufficiently low to classify them as barrier membranes. Phospholipid analysis by mass spectrometry showed the membrane, not including cholesterol, to be rich in phosphatidylcholine (35.8 mole percent), sphingomyelin (25.8 mole percent), and phosphatidylinositol (6.8 mole percent). Cholesterol concentration was 20.7 mole percent. Membrane vesicles isolated from oocytes expressing aquaporin-1 exhibited fourfold higher water permeability in stopped-flow experiments. Oocytes expressing mouse urea transporter A3 {(UT-A3)} exhibited 7.5-fold faster phloretin-inhibitable urea transport compared with water-injected controls. There was no difference in water permeability between these membrane vesicles, suggesting that {UT-A3} is not a water carrier. In conclusion, we describe an improved method for the isolation of the oocyte plasma membrane that will allow the study of water and solute transport kinetics as well as substrate selectivity in heterologously expressed proteins.},
