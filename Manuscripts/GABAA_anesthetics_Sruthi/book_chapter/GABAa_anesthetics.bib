abstract = {General anesthetics are widely used in clinical practice. On the molecular level, these compounds have been shown to modulate the activity of various neuronal ion channels. However, the functional relevance of identified sites in mediating essential components of the general anesthetic state, such as immobility and hypnosis, is still unknown. Using gene-targeting technology, we generated mice harboring a subtle point mutation (N265M) in the second transmembrane region of the beta3 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor. In these mice, the suppression of noxious-evoked movements in response to the intravenous anesthetics etomidate and propofol is completely abolished, while only slightly decreased with the volatile anesthetics enflurane and halothane. beta3(N265M) mice also display a profound reduction in the loss of righting reflex duration in response to intravenous but not volatile anesthetics. In addition, electrophysiological recordings revealed that anesthetic agents were significantly less effective in enhancing GABA(A) receptor-mediated currents, and in decreasing spontaneous action potential firing in cortical brain slices derived from mutant mice. Taken together, our results demonstrate that a single molecular target, and indeed a specific residue (N265) located within the GABA(A) receptor beta3 subunit, is a major determinant of behavioral responses evoked by the intravenous anesthetics etomidate and propofol, whereas volatile anesthetics appear to act via a broader spectrum of molecular targets.},

abstract = {Both volatile and intravenous general anesthetics allosterically enhance gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-evoked chloride currents at the GABA type A (GABAA) receptor. Recent work has revealed that two specific amino acid residues within transmembrane domain (TM)2 and TM3 are necessary for positive modulation of GABAA and glycine receptors by the volatile anesthetic enflurane. We now report that mutation of these residues within either GABAA alpha2 (S270 or A291) or beta1 (S265 or M286) subunits resulted in receptors that retain normal or near-normal gating by GABA but are insensitive to clinically relevant concentrations of another inhaled anesthetic, isoflurane. To determine whether receptor modulation by intravenous general anesthetics also was affected by these point mutations, we examined the effects of propofol, etomidate, the barbiturate methohexital, and the steroid alphaxalone on wild-type and mutant GABAA receptors expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. In most cases, these mutations had little or no effect on the actions of these intravenous anesthetics. However, a point mutation in the beta1 subunit (M286W) abolished potentiation of GABA by propofol but did not alter direct activation of the receptor by high concentrations of propofol. These data indicate that the receptor structural requirements for positive modulation by volatile and intravenous general anesthetics may be quite distinct.},

@article{Wang2006,
abstract = {The absolute (standard) binding free energy of eight FK506-related ligands to FKBP12 is calculated using free energy perturbation molecular dynamics (FEP/MD) simulations with explicit solvent. A number of features are implemented to improve the accuracy and enhance the convergence of the calculations. First, the absolute binding free energy is decomposed into sequential steps during which the ligand-surrounding interactions as well as various biasing potentials restraining the translation, orientation, and conformation of the ligand are turned "on" and "off." Second, sampling of the ligand conformation is enforced by a restraining potential based on the root mean-square deviation relative to the bound state conformation. The effect of all the restraining potentials is rigorously unbiased, and it is shown explicitly that the final results are independent of all artificial restraints. Third, the repulsive and dispersive free energy contribution arising from the Lennard-Jones interactions of the ligand with its surrounding (protein and solvent) is calculated using the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen separation. This separation also improves convergence of the FEP/MD calculations. Fourth, to decrease the computational cost, only a small number of atoms in the vicinity of the binding site are simulated explicitly, while all the influence of the remaining atoms is incorporated implicitly using the generalized solvent boundary potential (GSBP) method. With GSBP, the size of the simulated FKBP12/ligand systems is significantly reduced, from approximately 25,000 to 2500. The computations are very efficient and the statistical error is small ( approximately 1 kcal/mol). The calculated binding free energies are generally in good agreement with available experimental data and previous calculations (within approximately 2 kcal/mol). The present results indicate that a strategy based on FEP/MD simulations of a reduced GSBP atomic model sampled with conformational, translational, and orientational restraining potentials can be computationally inexpensive and accurate.},

abstract = {The computation of absolute binding affinities by molecular dynamics (MD) based free energy simulations is analyzed, and an exact method to carry out such a computation is presented. The key to obtaining converged results is the introduction of suitable, auxiliary restraints to prevent the ligand from leaving the binding site when the native ligand−receptor interactions are turned off alchemically. We describe a versatile set of restraints that (i) can be used in MD simulations, that (ii) restricts both the position and the orientation of the ligand, and that (iii) is defined relative to the receptor rather than relative to a fixed point in space. The free energy cost, $\Delta$Ar, for this set of restraints can be evaluated analytically. Although the techniques were originally developed for the gas phase, the resulting expression is exact, since all contributions from solute−solvent interactions cancel from the final result. The value of $\Delta$Ar depends only on the equilibrium values and force constants of the chose...},

This encouraging progress suggests that physics-based approaches hold the promise of making important contributions to the process of drug discovery and optimization in the near future. Two types of approaches are principally used to compute binding free energies with MD simulations. The most widely known is the alchemical double decoupling method, in which the interaction of the ligand with its surroundings are progressively switched off. It is also possible to use a potential of mean force (PMF) method, in which the ligand is physically separated from the protein receptor.

All three compounds act mainly through the two $\beta$+/$\alpha$- subunit transmembrane interfaces of the GABAA receptors.

We further demonstrated that these compounds have anesthetic activity in a small aquatic animal model, Xenopus laevis tadpoles.

Specifically, L9′S and L9′T mutations decreased agonist EC50, decreased apparent desensitization and prolonged deactivation in members of the LGIC superfamily, suggesting that this residue may regulate channel properties including desensitization. GABAA receptors desensitize in three phases, but in previous 9′ leucine studies, only slow phases of desensitization were resolved. We used excised patches containing $\alpha$1$\beta$3$\gamma$2L or $\alpha$1$\beta$3$\gamma$2L(L9′S) GABAA receptors and combined single channel recording and concentration jump techniques to reevaluate the effects of this mutation on desensitization. Although desensitization extent was decreased in mutated channels, desensitization still occurred in three phases, suggesting that desensitized states may be intact. Interestingly, deactivation rate was slowed by the mutation, opposite to that expected if desensitization was attenuated. $\alpha$1$\beta$3$\gamma$2L(L9′S) receptor single channels had increased open durations. Simulations revealed that stabilizing the open state (by decreasing the channel closing rate) could account for multiple macroscopic findings: left-shifted GABA EC50, smaller extent of desensitization, slower desensitization rate, and longer deactivation. We concluded that changes in efficacy can alter macroscopic desensitization without affecting desensitized states per se.},

abstract = {The GABAA receptor belongs, along with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, the glycine receptor and the 5-HT3 receptor, to a family of homologous transmitter-gated ion channels mediating fast synaptic transmission. Many classes of drug interact with the GABAA receptor, which is the major inhibitory ion channel in the mammalian brain. Among these drugs are the allosteric modulators acting at the benzodiazepine binding site. In this article, Erwin Sigel and Andreas Buhr discuss recent studies that have identified amino acid residues that are thought to form the binding pocket for these compounds. These residues are probably located at subunit interfaces of the protein pentamer and at least some of them are homologous to residues implicated in channel agonist binding. This implies pseudosymmetry of channel agonist and channel modulatory sites, which may be, as recent data indicate, a general principle realized in other pseudosymmetric protein complexes.},

In contrast to alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 receptors, alpha 6 beta 2 gamma 2 receptors fail to exhibit high-affinity binding of allosteric positive modulators of GABA-activated chloride currents. The critical determinant responsible for this difference in ligand binding was previously traced to a position in the extracellular domain of the two alpha subunits (alpha 1 His100 and alpha 6 Arg 101). We now show by patch clamp analysis that this amino acid exchange also determines the diazepam potentiation. Thus, alpha 1(Arg101)beta 2 gamma 2 receptors do not, but alpha 6(His100)beta 2 gamma 2 receptors do exhibit diazepam potentiation. However, the same extracellular determinant is not responsible for the increased GABA sensitivity of alpha 6 beta 2 gamma 2 receptors relative to alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 receptors as revealed by electrophysiological analysis and by differential GABA sensitivity of [35S]TBPS binding.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Amino acids in the beta subunit contribute to the action of general anaesthetics on GABA(A) receptors. We have now characterized the phenotypic effect of two beta subunit mutations in the most abundant GABA(A) receptor subtype, alpha1beta2gamma2. RESULTS The beta2(N265M) mutation in M2 decreased the modulatory actions of propofol, etomidate and enflurane, but not of alphaxalone, while the direct actions of propofol, etomidate and alphaxalone were impaired. The beta2(M286W) mutation in M3 decreased the modulatory actions of propofol, etomidate and enflurane, but not of alphaxalone, whereas the direct action of propofol and etomidate, but not of alphaxalone, was impaired. CONCLUSIONS We found that the actions of general anaesthetics at alpha1beta2(N265M)gamma2 and alpha1beta2(M286W)gamma2 GABA(A) receptors are similar to those previously observed at alpha2beta3(N265M)gamma2 and alpha2beta3(M286W)gamma2 GABA(A) recpetors, respectively, with the notable exceptions that the direct action of propofol was decreased in alpha1beta2(M286W)gamma2 receptors but indistinguishable form wild type in alpha2beta3(M286W)gamma2 receptors and that the direct action of alphaxalone was decreased in alpha1beta2(N265M)gamma2 but not alpha2beta3(N265M)gamma2 receptors and indistinguishable form wild type in alpha1beta2(M286W)gamma2 receptors but increased in alpha2beta3(M286W)gamma2 receptors. Thus, selected phenotypic consequences of these two mutations are GABA(A) receptor subtype-specific.},

abstract = {The potent general anesthetic etomidate produces its effects by enhancing GABA(A) receptor activation. Its photolabel analog [(3)H]azi-etomidate labels residues within transmembrane domains on alpha and beta subunits: alphaMet236 and betaMet286. We hypothesized that these methionines contribute to etomidate sites formed at alpha-beta subunit interfaces and that increasing side-chain bulk and hydrophobicity at either locus would mimic etomidate binding and block etomidate effects. Channel activity was electrophysiologically quantified in alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2L) receptors with alpha(1)M236W or beta(2)M286W mutations, in both the absence and the presence of etomidate. Measurements included spontaneous activation, GABA EC(50), etomidate agonist potentiation, etomidate direct activation, and rapid macrocurrent kinetics. Both alpha(1)M236W and beta(2)M286W mutations induced spontaneous channel opening, lowered GABA EC(50), increased maximal GABA efficacy, and slowed current deactivation, mimicking effects of etomidate on alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2L) channels. These changes were larger with alpha(1)M236W than with beta(2)M286W. Etomidate (3.2 muM) reduced GABA EC(50) much less in alpha(1)M236Wbeta(2)gamma(2L) receptors (2-fold) than in wild type (23-fold). However, etomidate was more potent and efficacious in directly activating alpha(1)M236Wbeta(2)gamma(2L) compared with wild type. In alpha(1)beta(2)M286Wgamma(2L) receptors, etomidate induced neither agonist-potentiation nor direct channel activation. These results support the hypothesis that alpha(1)Met236 and beta(2)Met286 are within etomidate sites that allosterically link to channel gating. Although alpha(1)M236W produced the larger impact on channel gating, beta(2)M286W produced more profound changes in etomidate sensitivity, suggesting a dominant role in drug binding. Furthermore, quantitative mechanistic analysis demonstrated that wild-type and mutant results are consistent with the presence of only one class of etomidate sites mediating both agonist potentiation and direct activation.},

abstract = {??-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors are an important target for general anesthetics in the central nervous system. Site-directed mutagenesis techniques have identified amino acid residues that are important for the positive modulation of GABAA receptors by general anesthetics. In the present study, we investigate the role of an amino acid residue in transmembrane (TM) domain 3 of the GABAA receptor ??2 subunit for modulation by the general anesthetic 2,6-diisopropylphenol (propofol). Mutation of methionine 286 to tryptophan (M286W) in the ??2 subunit abolished potentiation of GABA responses by propofol but did not affect direct receptor activation by propofol in the absence of GABA. In contrast, substitution of methionine 286 by alanine, cysteine, glutamate, lysine, phenylalanine, serine, or tyrosine was permissive for potentiation of GABA responses and direct activation by propofol. Using propofol analogs of varying molecular size, we show that the ??2(M286W) mutation resulted in a decrease in the 'cut-off' volume for propofol analog molecules to enhance GABA responses at GABAA ??1??2??2s receptors. This suggests that mutation of M286 in the GABAA ??2 subunit alters the dimensions of a 'binding pocket' for propofol and related alkylphenol general anesthetics. ?? 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {The GABAA receptor is a target of many general anesthetics. The low affinity of general anesthetics has complicated the search for the location of anesthetic binding sites. Attention has focused on two pairs of residues near the extracellular ends of the M2 and M3 membrane-spanning segments, alpha1Ser270/beta2Asn265 (15' M2) and alpha1Ala291/beta2Met286 (M3). In the 4-A resolution acetylcholine receptor structure, the aligned positions are separated by approximately 10 A. To determine whether these residues are part of a binding site for propofol, an intravenous anesthetic, we probed propofol's ability to protect cysteines substituted for these residues from modification by the sulfhydryl-specific reagent p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate (pCMBS-). pCMBS- reacted with cysteines substituted at the four positions in the absence and presence of GABA. Because propofol binding induces conformational change in the GABAAreceptor, we needed to establish a reference state of the receptor to compare reaction rates in the absence and presence of propofol. We compared reaction rates in the presence of GABA with those in the presence of propofol +GABA. The GABA concentration was reduced to give a similar fraction of the maximal GABA current in both conditions. Propofol protected, in a concentration-dependent manner, the cysteine substituted for beta2Met286 from reaction with pCMBS-. Propofol did not protect the cysteine substituted for the aligned alpha1 subunit position or the 15' M2 segment Cys mutants in either subunit. We infer that propofol may bind near the extracellular end of the betasubunit M3 segment.},

abstract = {Propofol, an intravenous anesthetic, is a positive modulator of the GABAA receptor, but the mechanistic details, including the relevant binding sites and alternate targets, remain disputed. Here we undertook an in-depth study of alkylphenol-based anesthetic binding to synaptic membranes. We designed, synthesized and characterized a chemically active alkylphenol anesthetic (AziPm-click 1: ), for affinity-based protein profiling (ABPP) of propofol-binding proteins in their native state within mouse synaptosomes. The ABPP strategy captured {\~{}}4{\%} of the synaptosomal proteome, including the unbiased capture of five alpha or beta GABAA receptor subunits. Lack of gamma2 subunit capture was not due to low abundance. Consistent with this, independent molecular dynamics simulations with Alchemical Free Energy Perturbation calculations predicted selective propofol binding to interfacial sites, with higher affinities for alpha/beta than gamma-containing interfaces. The simulations indicated hydrogen bonding is a key component leading to propofol selective binding within GABAA receptor subunit interfaces, with stable hydrogen bonds observed between propofol and alpha/beta cavity residues, but not gamma cavity residues. We confirmed this by introducing a hydrogen bond-null propofol analogue as a protecting ligand for targeted- ABPP and observed a lack of GABAA receptor subunit protection. This investigation demonstrates striking interfacial GABAA receptor subunit selectivity in native milieu, suggesting that asymmetric occupancy of heteropentameric ion channels by alkylphenol-based anesthetics is sufficient to induce modulation of activity.},

abstract = {Propofol is a sedative and anesthetic agent that can both activate GABAA receptors and potentiate receptor activation elicited by submaximal concentrations of the transmitter. A recent modeling study of the beta3 homomeric GABAA receptor (Franks, 2015, Anesthesiology 122:787) postulated a high-affinity propofol binding site in a hydrophobic pocket in the middle of a triangular cleft lined by the M1 and M2 membrane-spanning domains of one subunit and the M2 domain of the neighboring subunit. The goal of the present study was to gain functional evidence for the involvement of this pocket in the actions of propofol. Human beta3 and alpha1beta3 receptors were expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and the effects of substitutions of selected residues were probed on channel activation by propofol and pentobarbital. The data demonstrate a vital role of the beta3(Y143), beta3(F221), beta3(Q224), and beta3(T266) residues in the actions of propofol but not pentobarbital in beta3 receptors. The effects of beta3(Y143W) and beta3(Q224W) on activation by propofol are likely steric because propofol analogs with less bulky ortho substituents activated both wild-type and mutant receptors. The T266W mutation removed activation by propofol in beta3 homomeric receptors, however, this mutation alone or in combination with a homologous mutation (I271W) in the alpha1 subunit had almost no effect on activation properties in alpha1beta3 heteromeric receptors. We hypothesize that heteromeric alpha1beta3 receptors can be activated by propofol interactions with beta3-beta3, alpha1-beta3 and beta3-alpha1 interfaces but the exact locations of the binding site and/or nature of interactions vary in different classes of interfaces.},

They are oligomeric assemblies that provide prototypical examples of allosterically regulated integral membrane proteins. Here, we present an overview of the most recent advances on the signal transduction mechanism based on the X-ray structures of both prokaryotic and invertebrate eukaryotic pLGICs and atomistic Molecular Dynamics simulations. The present results suggest that ion gating involves a large structural reorganization of the molecule mediated by two distinct quaternary transitions, a global twisting and the blooming of the extracellular domain, which can be modulated by ligand binding at the topographically distinct orthosteric and allosteric sites. The emerging model of gating is consistent with a wealth of functional studies and will boost the development of novel pharmacological strategies.},

abstract = {Propofol, an intravenous anesthetic, is a positive modulator of the GABAA receptor, but the mechanistic details, including the relevant binding sites and alternate targets, remain disputed. Here we undertook an in-depth study of alkylphenol-based anesthetic binding to synaptic membranes. We designed, synthesized and characterized a chemically active alkylphenol anesthetic (AziPm-click 1: ), for affinity-based protein profiling (ABPP) of propofol-binding proteins in their native state within mouse synaptosomes. The ABPP strategy captured {\~{}}4{\%} of the synaptosomal proteome, including the unbiased capture of five $\alpha$ or $\beta$ GABAA receptor subunits. Lack of $\gamma$2 subunit capture was not due to low abundance. Consistent with this, independent molecular dynamics simulations with Alchemical Free Energy Perturbation calculations predicted selective propofol binding to interfacial sites, with higher affinities for $\alpha$/$\beta$ than $\gamma$-containing interfaces. The simulations indicated hydrogen bonding is a key component leading to propofol selective binding within GABAA receptor subunit interfaces, with stable hydrogen bonds observed between propofol and $\alpha$/$\beta$ cavity residues, but not $\gamma$ cavity residues. We confirmed this by introducing a hydrogen bond-null propofol analogue as a protecting ligand for targeted- ABPP and observed a lack of GABAA receptor subunit protection.

abstract = {The theoretical prediction of water drying transitions near nonpolar surfaces has stimulated an intensive search for biological processes exploiting this extreme form of hydrophobicity. Here we quantitatively demonstrate that drying of a hydrophobic constriction is the major determinant of ion conductance in the GLIC pentameric ion channel. Molecular-dynamics simulations show that in the closed state, the channel conductance is ???12 orders-of-magnitude lower than in the open state. This large drop in conductance is remarkable because even in the functionally closed conformation the pore constriction remains wide enough for the passage of sodium ions, aided by a continuous bridge of ???12 water molecules. However, we find that the free energy cost of hydrating the hydrophobic gate is large, accounting almost entirely for the energetic barrier blocking ion passage. The free energies of transferring a sodium ion into a prehydrated gate in functionally closed and open states differ by only 1.2 kcal/mol, compared to an 11 kcal/mol difference in the costs of hydrating the hydrophobic gate. Conversely, ion desolvation effects play only minor roles in GLIC ion channel gating. Our simulations help rationalize experiments probing the gating kinetics of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in response to mutations of pore-lining residues. The molecular character and phase behavior of water should thus be included in quantitative descriptions of ion channel gating. ?? 2012 by the Biophysical Society.},

Hosting a large number of structurally and functionally diverse proteins associated with this key metabolic compartment, the membrane not only directly controls the traffic of various molecules in and out of the cell, it also participates in such diverse and important processes as signal transduction and chemical processing of incoming molecular species. In this article, we present a number of cases where details of interaction of small molecular species such as drugs with the membrane, which are often experimentally inaccessible, have been studied using advanced molecular simulation techniques. We have selected systems in which partitioning of the small molecule with the membrane constitutes a key step for its final biological function, often binding to and interacting with a protein associated with the membrane. These examples demonstrate that membrane partitioning is not only important for the overall distribution of drugs and other small molecules into different compartments of the body, it may also play a key role in determining the efficiency and the mode of interaction of the drug with its target protein.},

We review the derivation of Jarzynski's equality, generalize it to isobaric--isothermal processes, and discuss its implications in relation to the second law of thermodynamics and computer simulations. In the relevant regime of steering by means of stiff springs, we demonstrate that the work on the system is Gaussian-distributed regardless of the speed of the process simulated. In this case, the cumulant expansion of Jarzynski's equality can be safely terminated at second order.

abstract = {Electrostatic forces are one of the primary determinants of molecular interactions. They help guide the folding of proteins, increase the binding of one protein to another and facilitate protein-DNA and protein-ligand binding. A popular method for computing the electrostatic properties of biological systems is to numerically solve the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation, and there are several easy-to-use software packages available that solve the PB equation for soluble proteins. Here we present a freely available program, called APBSmem, for carrying out these calculations in the presence of a membrane. The Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS) is used as a back-end for solving the PB equation, and a Java-based graphical user interface (GUI) coordinates a set of routines that introduce the influence of the membrane, determine its placement relative to the protein, and set the membrane potential. The software Jmol is embedded in the GUI to visualize the protein inserted in the membrane before the calculation and the electrostatic potential after completing the computation. We expect that the ease with which the GUI allows one to carry out these calculations will make this software a useful resource for experimenters and computational researchers alike. Three examples of membrane protein electrostatic calculations are carried out to illustrate how to use APBSmem and to highlight the different quantities of interest that can be calculated.},

The thyroid hormone L-3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) inhibits GABAA receptors at micromolar concentrations and has common features with neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone (ALLOP). Here we use functional experiments on $\alpha$2$\beta$1$\gamma$2 GABAA receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes to detect competitive interactions between T3 and an agonist (ivermectin, IVM) with a crystallographically determined binding site at subunit interfaces in the transmembrane domain of a homologous receptor (glutamate-gated chloride channel, GluCl). T3 and ALLOP also show competitive effects, supporting the presence of both a T3 and ALLOP binding site at one or more subunit interfaces. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations over 200 ns are used to investigate the dynamics and energetics of T3 in the identified intersubunit sites. In these simulations, T3 molecules occupying all intersubunit sites (with the exception of the $\alpha$-$\beta$ interface) display numerous energetically favorable conformations with multiple hydrogen bonding partners, including previously implicated polar/acidic sidechains and a structurally conserved deformation in the M1 backbone.},

abstract = {Binding affinities of (R,R)-1,2-cyclohexanediamine (R) to (R,R)-1,2-cyclopentanediol (R-5) and (S,S)-1,2-cyclopentanediol (S-5) and to the corresponding cyclohexanediols (R-6 and S-6) have been measured in benzene and in CCl4 at 298 K by microcalorimetry, and unexpected differences between the diastereomeric complexes are observed. Long time scale (0.1 mu s) molecular-dynamics simulations of the two smaller diastereomeric complexes, R/R-5 and R/S-5, in a simplified solvent model are reported. A direct free energy calculation gives results in good agreement with the experimental values measured in benzene for the first pair, but nearly identical results for the second pair, which is at variance with experiment. A systematic analysis of the dependence of simulation results on model parameters is performed, and no possibility is found to improve the enantioselectivity by parameter tuning. Other possible causes for discrepancies are specific solute-solvent or solvent-solvent interactions, electronic charge redistribution effects, or formation of clusters of more than two molecules. Owing to the long time scales reached, a well-converged picture of the dynamics is obtained, and the species present at equilibrium can be studied in detail. The average lifetime of the complex is found to be about 200 ps, whereas that of a hydrogen bond is only about 5 ps. Besides the unbound state, the dominant species observed in the simulations for both diastereomeric pairs are singly hydrogen-bonded complexes, with a clear preference for a O to N over the N to O hydrogen bond. Many other hydrogen-bonding patterns (bridged, double) are also observed in minor amounts.},

abstract = {An increasing number of studies have reported computations of the standard (absolute) binding free energy of small ligands to proteins using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and explicit solvent molecules that are in good agreement with experiments. This encouraging progress suggests that physics-based approaches hold the promise of making important contributions to the process of drug discovery and optimization in the near future. Two types of approaches are principally used to compute binding free energies with MD simulations. The most widely known is the alchemical double decoupling method, in which the interaction of the ligand with its surroundings are progressively switched off. It is also possible to use a potential of mean force (PMF) method, in which the ligand is physically separated from the protein receptor. For both of these computational approaches, restraining potentials may be activated and released during the simulation for sampling efficiently the changes in translational, rotational, and conformational freedom of the ligand and protein upon binding. Because such restraining potentials add bias to the simulations, it is important that their effects be rigorously removed to yield a binding free energy that is properly unbiased with respect to the standard state. A review of recent results is presented, and differences in computational methods are discussed. Examples of computations with T4-lysozyme mutants, FKBP12, SH2 domain, and cytochrome P450 are discussed and compared. Remaining difficulties and challenges are highlighted.},

@article{Boresch2003,
abstract = {The computation of absolute binding affinities by molecular dynamics (MD) based free energy simulations is analyzed, and an exact method to carry out such a computation is presented. The key to obtaining converged results is the introduction of suitable, auxiliary restraints to prevent the ligand from leaving the binding site when the native ligand−receptor interactions are turned off alchemically. We describe a versatile set of restraints that (i) can be used in MD simulations, that (ii) restricts both the position and the orientation of the ligand, and that (iii) is defined relative to the receptor rather than relative to a fixed point in space. The free energy cost, $\Delta$Ar, for this set of restraints can be evaluated analytically. Although the techniques were originally developed for the gas phase, the resulting expression is exact, since all contributions from solute−solvent interactions cancel from the final result. The value of $\Delta$Ar depends only on the equilibrium values and force constants of the chosen harmonic restraint terms and, therefore, can be easily calculated. The standard state dependence of binding free energies is also investigated, and it is shown that the present approach takes this into account correctly. The analytical expression for $\Delta$Ar is verified numerically by calculations on the complex formed by benzene with the L99A mutant of T4 lysozyme. The overall approach is illustrated by a complete binding free energy calculation for a complex based on a simplified model for tyrosine bound to tyrosyl-tRNA-synthetase. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed set of restraints and confirm that the calculated binding free energy is independent of the details of the restraints. Comparisons are made with earlier formulations for the calculation of binding free energies, and certain limitations of that work are described. The relationship between $\Delta$Ar and the loss of translational and rotational entropy during a binding process is analyzed.},

abstract = {Alchemical free energy calculations are becoming a useful tool for calculating absolute binding free energies of small molecule ligands to proteins. Here, we find that the presence of multiple metastable ligand orientations can cause convergence problems when distance restraints alone are used. We demonstrate that the use of orientational restraints can greatly accelerate the convergence of these calculations. However, even with this acceleration, we find that sufficient sampling requires substantially longer simulations than are used in many published protocols. To further accelerate convergence, we introduce a new method of configuration space decomposition by orientation which reduces required simulation lengths by at least a factor of 5 in the cases examined. Our method is easily parallelizable, well suited for cases where a ligand cocrystal structure is not available, and can utilize initial orientations generated by docking packages.},

abstract = {To understand the molecular mechanism of ion permeation in pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGIC), we solved the structure of an open form of GLIC, a prokaryotic pLGIC, at 2.4 {\AA}. Anomalous diffraction data were used to place bound anions and cations. This reveals ordered water molecules at the level of two rings of hydroxylated residues (named Ser6' and Thr2') that contribute to the ion selectivity filter. Two water pentagons are observed, a self-stabilized ice-like water pentagon and a second wider water pentagon, with one sodium ion between them. Single-channel electrophysiology shows that the side-chain hydroxyl of Ser6' is crucial for ion translocation. Simulations and electrostatics calculations complemented the description of hydration in the pore and suggest that the water pentagons observed in the crystal are important for the ion to cross hydrophobic constriction barriers. Simulations that pull a cation through the pore reveal that residue Ser6' actively contributes to ion translocation by reorienting its side chain when the ion is going through the pore. Generalization of these findings to the pLGIC family is proposed.},

abstract = {Currently, adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) is recognized as the extracellular messenger that acts through P2 receptors. P2 receptors are divided into two subtypes: P2Y metabotropic receptors and P2X ionotropic receptors, both of which are found in virtually all mammalian cell types studied. Due to the difficulty in studying membrane protein structures by X-ray crystallography or NMR techniques, there is little information about these structures available in the literature. Two structures of the P2X4 receptor in truncated form have been solved by crystallography. Molecular modeling has proven to be an excellent tool for studying ionotropic receptors. Recently, modeling studies carried out on P2X receptors have advanced our knowledge of the P2X receptor structure-function relationships. This review presents a brief history of ion channel structural studies and shows how modeling approaches can be used to address relevant questions about P2X receptors.},

abstract = {Epilepsies affect at least 2{\%} of the population at some time in life, and many forms have genetic determinants. We have found a mutation in a gene encoding a GABA(A) receptor subunit in a large family with epilepsy. The two main phenotypes were childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) and febrile seizures (FS). There is a recognized genetic relationship between FS and CAE, yet the two syndromes have different ages of onset, and the physiology of absences and convulsions is distinct. This suggests the mutation has age-dependent effects on different neuronal networks that influence the expression of these clinically distinct, but genetically related, epilepsy phenotypes. We found that the mutation in GABRG2 (encoding the gamma2-subunit) abolished in vitro sensitivity to diazepam, raising the possibility that endozepines do in fact exist and have a physiological role in preventing seizures.},

@article{Grosman2000,
abstract = {We describe the functional consequences of mutations in the linker between the second and third transmembrane segments (M2-M3L) of muscle acetylcholine receptors at the single-channel level. Hydrophobic mutations (Ile, Cys, and Phe) placed near the middle of the linker of the alpha subunit (alphaS269) prolong apparent openings elicited by low concentrations of acetylcholine (ACh), whereas hydrophilic mutations (Asp, Lys, and Gln) are without effect. Because the gating kinetics of the alphaS269I receptor (a congenital myasthenic syndrome mutant) in the presence of ACh are too fast, choline was used as the agonist. This revealed an approximately 92-fold increased gating equilibrium constant, which is consistent with an approximately 10-fold decreased EC(50) in the presence of ACh. With choline, this mutation accelerates channel opening approximately 28-fold, slows channel closing approximately 3-fold, but does not affect agonist binding to the closed state. These ratios suggest that, with ACh, alphaS269I acetylcholine receptors open at a rate of approximately 1.4 x 10(6) s(-1) and close at a rate of approximately 760 s(-1). These gating rate constants, together with the measured duration of apparent openings at low ACh concentrations, further suggest that ACh dissociates from the diliganded open receptor at a rate of approximately 140 s(-1). Ile mutations at positions flanking alphaS269 impair, rather than enhance, channel gating. Inserting or deleting one residue from this linker in the alpha subunit increased and decreased, respectively, the apparent open time approximately twofold. Contrary to the alphaS269I mutation, Ile mutations at equivalent positions of the beta, straightepsilon, and delta subunits do not affect apparent open-channel lifetimes. However, in beta and straightepsilon, shifting the mutation one residue to the NH(2)-terminal end enhances channel gating. The overall results indicate that this linker is a control element whose hydrophobicity determines channel gating in a position- and subunit-dependent manner. Characterization of the transition state of the gating reaction suggests that during channel opening the M2-M3L of the alpha subunit moves before the corresponding linkers of the beta and straightepsilon subunits.},

abstract = {5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT3) receptors are members of the Cys-loop receptor superfamily. Neurotransmitter binding in these proteins triggers the opening (gating) of an ion channel by means of an as-yet-uncharacterized conformational change. Here we show that a specific proline (Pro 8*), located at the apex of the loop between the second and third transmembrane helices (M2-M3), can link binding to gating through a cis-trans isomerization of the protein backbone. Using unnatural amino acid mutagenesis, a series of proline analogues with varying preference for the cis conformer was incorporated at the 8* position. Proline analogues that strongly favour the trans conformer produced non-functional channels. Among the functional mutants there was a strong correlation between the intrinsic cis-trans energy gap of the proline analogue and the activation of the channel, suggesting that cis-trans isomerization of this single proline provides the switch that interconverts the open and closed states of the channel. Consistent with this proposal, nuclear magnetic resonance studies on an M2-M3 loop peptide reveal two distinct, structured forms. Our results thus confirm the structure of the M2-M3 loop and the critical role of Pro 8* in the 5-HT3 receptor. In addition, they suggest that a molecular rearrangement at Pro 8* is the structural mechanism that opens the receptor pore.},

Residues from alpha(1)Arg-273 to alpha(1)Ile-289 were mutated to cysteine, one at a time. MTSET(+) or MTSES(-) reacted with all mutants from alpha(1)R273C to alpha(1)Y281C, except alpha(1)P277C, in the absence and presence of GABA. The MTSET(+) closed-state reaction rate was {\textgreater}1000 liters/mol-s at alpha(1)N274C, alpha(1)S275C, alpha(1)K278C, and alpha(1)Y281C and was {\textless}300 liters/mol-s at alpha(1)R273C, alpha(1)L276C, alpha(1)V279C, alpha(1)A280C, and alpha(1)A284C. These two groups of residues lie on opposite sides of an alpha-helix. The fast reacting group lies on a continuation of the M2 segment channel-lining helix face. This suggests that the M2 segment alpha-helix extends about two helical turns beyond alpha(1)N274 (20'), aligned with the extracellular ring of charge. At alpha(1)S275C, alpha(1)V279C, alpha(1)A280C, and alpha(1)A284C the reaction rate was faster in the presence of GABA. The reagents had no functional effect on the mutants from alpha(1)A282C to alpha(1)I289C, except alpha(1)A284C. Access may be sterically hindered possibly by close interaction with the extracellular domain. We suggest that the M2 segment alpha-helix extends beyond the predicted extracellular end of the M2 segment and that gating induces a conformational change in and/or around the N-terminal half of the M2-M3 loop. Implications for coupling ligand-evoked conformational changes in the extracellular domain to channel gating in the membrane-spanning domain are discussed.},

abstract = {Fast synaptic neurotransmission is mediated by transmitter-activated conformational changes in ligand-gated ion channel receptors, culminating in opening of the integral ion channel pore. Human hereditary hyperekplexia, or startle disease, is caused by mutations in both the intracellular or extracellular loops flanking the pore-lining M2 domain of the glycine receptor alpha1 subunit. These flanking domains are designated the M1-M2 loop and the M2-M3 loop respectively. We show that four startle disease mutations and six additional alanine substitution mutations distributed throughout both loops result in uncoupling of the ligand binding sites from the channel activation gate. We therefore conclude that the M1-M2 and M2-M3 loops act in parallel to activate the channel. Their locations strongly suggest that they act as hinges governing allosteric control of the M2 domain. As the members of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily share a common structure, this signal transduction model may apply to all members of this superfamily.},

abstract = {We have developed a method to determine the stoichiometry of subunits within an oligomeric cell surface receptor using fluorescently tagged antibodies to the individual subunits and measuring energy transfer between them. Anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody (mAb 9-E10) derivatized with a fluorophore (europium cryptate, EuK) was used to individually label c-Myc-tagged 1-, {\{}beta{\}}2-, or {\{}gamma{\}}2-subunits of the hetero-oligomeric {\{}gamma{\}}-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor in intact cells. The maximal fluorescent signal derived from the 1(c-Myc){\{}beta{\}}2{\{}gamma{\}}2 and the 1{\{}beta{\}}2(c-Myc){\{}gamma{\}}2 receptors was twice that obtained with 1{\{}beta{\}}2{\{}gamma{\}}2(c-Myc), suggesting that there are 2x -, 2x {\{}beta{\}}-, and 1x {\{}gamma{\}}-subunits in a receptor monomer. This observation was extended using fluorescence energy transfer. Receptors were half-maximally saturated with EuK-anti-c-Myc mAb, and the remaining 1(c-Myc) subunits were labeled with excess anti-c-Myc mAb derivatized with the fluorescence energy acceptor, XL665. On exposure to laser light, energy transfer from EuK to XL665 occurred with 1(c-Myc){\{}beta{\}}2{\{}gamma{\}}2 and 1{\{}beta{\}}2(c-Myc){\{}gamma{\}}2, but no significant energy transfer was observed with 1{\{}beta{\}}2{\{}gamma{\}}2(c-Myc) receptors, indicating the absence of a second {\{}gamma{\}}-subunit in a receptor monomer. We confirm that the GABAA receptor subtype, 1{\{}beta{\}}2{\{}gamma{\}}2, is composed of two copies each of the - and {\{}beta{\}}-subunits and one copy of the {\{}gamma{\}}-subunit (i.e.(1)2({\{}beta{\}}2)2({\{}gamma{\}}2)1) and conclude that this method would have general applicability to other multisubunit cell surface proteins.},

abstract = {gamma-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABA-A) receptors are a major mediator of inhibitory neurotransmission in the mammalian central nervous system, and the site of action of a number of clinically important drugs. These receptors exist as a family of subtypes with distinct temporal and spatial patterns of expression and distinct properties that presumably underlie a precise role for each subtype. The newest member of this gene family is the theta subunit. The deduced polypeptide sequence is 627 amino acids long and has highest sequence identity (50.5{\%}) with the beta1 subunit. Within the rat striatum, this subunit coassembles with alpha2, beta1, and gamma1, suggesting that gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors consisting of arrangements other than alpha beta + gamma, delta, or epsilon do exist. Expression of alpha2beta1gamma1theta in transfected mammalian cells leads to the formation of receptors with a 4-fold decrease in the affinity for gamma-aminobutyric acid compared with alpha2beta1gamma1. This subunit has a unique distribution, with studies so far suggesting significant expression within monoaminergic neurons of both human and monkey brain.},

abstract = {A common feature of general anaesthetic agents is their ability to potentiate neuronal inhibition through GABA(A) (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptors. At concentrations relevant to clinical anaesthesia, these agents cause a dramatic stimulation of the chloride currents that are evoked by the binding of the natural ligand, GABA. Although there is widespread evidence that the sensitivity of GABA(A) receptors to anaesthetic agents is heterogeneous, the structural basis of these differences is largely unknown. Variations in subunit composition can have profound effects on the sensitivity of GABA(A) receptors to modulatory agents such as benzodiazepines. However, strict subunit specificity has not been demonstrated for the potentiating effects of anaesthetic agents. Here we describe a new class of human GABA(A) receptor subunit (epsilon) that can assemble with alpha- and beta-subunits and confer an insensitivity to the potentiating effects of intravenous anaesthetic agents. The epsilon-subunit also abolishes the normal outward rectification of recombinant receptors in which it assembles. The expression pattern of this subunit in the brain suggests a new target for manipulation of neuronal pathways within the basal ganglia.},

Many classes of drug interact with the GABAA receptor, which is the major inhibitory ion channel in the mammalian brain. Among these drugs are the allosteric modulators acting at the benzodiazepine binding site. In this article, Erwin Sigel and Andreas Buhr discuss recent studies that have identified amino acid residues that are thought to form the binding pocket for these compounds. These residues are probably located at subunit interfaces of the protein pentamer and at least some of them are homologous to residues implicated in channel agonist binding. This implies pseudosymmetry of channel agonist and channel modulatory sites, which may be, as recent data indicate, a general principle realized in other pseudosymmetric protein complexes.},

abstract = {One of the more challenging issues in medicinal chemistry is the computation of the free energy of ligand binding to macromolecular targets. This allows for the screening of libraries of chemicals for fast and inexpensive identification of lead compounds. Many attempts have been made and several algorithms have been developed for this purpose. Whereas enthalpic contributions are evaluated using methods and equations for which there is a reasonable consensus among researchers, the entropic contribution is evaluated using very different, and, in some cases, very approximate methods, or it is entirely ignored. Entropic contributions are of primary importance in the formation of many ligand-protein complexes, as well as in protein folding. The hydrophobic interaction, associated with the release of water molecules from the protein active site and the ligand, plays a significant role in complex formation, predominantly contributing to the total entropy change and, in some cases, to the total free energy of binding. There are distinct approaches for the evaluation of the contribution of water molecules to the free energy of binding based on Newtonian mechanics force fields, multi-parameter empirical scoring functions and experimental force fields. This review describes these methods -- discussing both their advantages and limitations. Particular emphasis will be placed on HINT (Hydropatic INTeractions), a "natural" force field that takes into account in a unified way enthalpic and entropic contributions of all interacting atoms in protein-ligand complexes, including released and structured water molecules. As a case-study, the contribution of water molecules to the binding free energy of HIV-1 protease inhibitors is evaluated.},

[(3)H]2-(3-Methyl-3H-diaziren-3-yl)ethyl 1-(phenylethyl)-1H-imidazole-5-carboxylate (azietomidate) and R-[(3)H]5-allyl-1-methyl-5-(m-trifluoromethyl-diazirynylphenyl)barbituric acid (mTFD-MPAB), photoreactive analogs of 2-ethyl 1-(phenylethyl)-1H-imidazole-5-carboxylate (etomidate) and mephobarbital, respectively, have identified two homologous but pharmacologically distinct classes of intersubunit-binding sites for general anesthetics in the GABAAR transmembrane domain. Here, we use a photoreactive analog of propofol (2-isopropyl-5-[3-(trifluoromethyl)-3H-diazirin-3-yl]phenol ([(3)H]AziPm)) to identify propofol-binding sites in heterologously expressed human $\alpha$1$\beta$3 GABAARs. Propofol, AziPm, etomidate, and R-mTFD-MPAB each inhibited [(3)H]AziPm photoincorporation into GABAAR subunits maximally by ∼ 50{\%}. When the amino acids photolabeled by [(3)H]AziPm were identified by protein microsequencing, we found propofol-inhibitable photolabeling of amino acids in the $\beta$3-$\alpha$1 subunit interface ($\beta$3Met-286 in $\beta$3M3 and $\alpha$1Met-236 in $\alpha$1M1), previously photolabeled by [(3)H]azietomidate, and $\alpha$1Ile-239, located one helical turn below $\alpha$1Met-236. There was also propofol-inhibitable [(3)H]AziPm photolabeling of $\beta$3Met-227 in $\beta$M1, the amino acid in the $\alpha$1-$\beta$3 subunit interface photolabeled by R-[(3)H]mTFD-MPAB. The propofol-inhibitable [(3)H]AziPm photolabeling in the GABAAR $\beta$3 subunit in conjunction with the concentration dependence of inhibition of that photolabeling by etomidate or R-mTFD-MPAB also establish that each anesthetic binds to the homologous site at the $\beta$3-$\beta$3 subunit interface. These results establish that AziPm as well as propofol bind to the homologous intersubunit sites in the GABAAR transmembrane domain that binds etomidate or R-mTFD-MPAB with high affinity.},

abstract = {AZD3043 (previously named THRX-918661) is a novel short-acting intravenous anesthetic agent in clinical trials. Although AZD3043 is a positive modulator at the $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A-receptor, its potency and efficacy have not been characterized in detail. Nor is it known whether the point-mutations in the $\beta$-subunit of the GABAA-receptor that dramatically reduce the anesthetic effect of propofol (i.e. $\beta$2 (N289M) and $\beta$3 (N290M)), also influence the effect of AZD3043. This study investigated the in vitro pharmacology of AZD3043 at the most common human GABAA receptor subtypes. Subunits of four human wild-type ($\alpha$1$\beta$2, $\alpha$1$\beta$2$\gamma$2, $\alpha$2$\beta$2$\gamma$2 and $\alpha$2$\beta$3$\gamma$2) and two mutant ($\alpha$1$\beta$2(N289M)$\gamma$2 and $\alpha$2$\beta$3(N290M) $\gamma$2) GABAA receptor channels were introduced into Xenopus oocytes and studied with two-electrode voltage-clamp. AZD3043 potentiated and directly activated the $\alpha$1$\beta$2$\gamma$2, $\alpha$2$\beta$2$\gamma$2 and $\alpha$2$\beta$3$\gamma$2 GABAA receptor subtypes. Moreover, both potency and efficacy of AZD3043 were reduced at the mutant $\alpha$1$\beta$ 2(N289M)$\gamma$2 and $\alpha$2$\beta$3(N290M)$\gamma$2 subtypes. AZD3043 increased the GABA response also in GABAA receptors lacking the $\gamma$2-subunit, i.e. $\alpha$1$\beta$2. In conclusion, AZD3043 is a positive modulator and a direct agonist at human GABAA receptors and is not dependent on the $\gamma$2-subunit for its effect. Similar to propofol, the effect of AZD3043 is dramatically reduced by point-mutations in the $\beta$2(N289M) and $\beta$3(N290M) subunits, indicating similar molecular mechanisms of action for propofol and AZD3043 at the human GABAA receptor. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

How such structurally diverse agents can act similarly as positive allosteric modulators of GABAARs remains unclear. Previously, photoreactive etomidate analogs identified two equivalent anesthetic-binding sites in the transmembrane domain at the $\beta$(+)-$\alpha$(-) subunit interfaces, which also contain the GABA-binding sites in the extracellular domain. Here, we used R-[(3)H]5-allyl-1-methyl-5-(m-trifluoromethyl-diazirynylphenyl) barbituric acid (R-mTFD-MPAB), a potent stereospecific barbiturate anesthetic, to photolabel expressed human $\alpha$1$\beta$3$\gamma$2 GABAARs.

abstract = {GABA type A receptors (GABAAR), the brain's major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors, are the targets for many general anesthetics, including volatile anesthetics, etomidate, propofol, and barbiturates. How such structurally diverse agents can act similarly as positive allosteric modulators of GABAARs remains unclear. Previously, photoreactive etomidate analogs identified two equivalent anesthetic-binding sites in the transmembrane domain at the $\beta$(+)-$\alpha$(-) subunit interfaces, which also contain the GABA-binding sites in the extracellular domain. Here, we used R-[(3)H]5-allyl-1-methyl-5-(m-trifluoromethyl-diazirynylphenyl) barbituric acid (R-mTFD-MPAB), a potent stereospecific barbiturate anesthetic, to photolabel expressed human $\alpha$1$\beta$3$\gamma$2 GABAARs.

abstract = {AZD3043 (previously named THRX-918661) is a novel short-acting intravenous anesthetic agent in clinical trials. Although AZD3043 is a positive modulator at the $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A)-receptor, its potency and efficacy have not been characterized in detail. Nor is it known whether the point-mutations in the $\beta$-subunit of the GABA(A)-receptor that dramatically reduce the anesthetic effect of propofol (i.e. $\beta$2 (N289M) and $\beta$3 (N290M)), also influence the effect of AZD3043. This study investigated the in vitro pharmacology of AZD3043 at the most common human GABA(A) receptor subtypes. Subunits of four human wild-type ($\alpha$1$\beta$2, $\alpha$1$\beta$2$\gamma$2, $\alpha$2$\beta$2$\gamma$2 and $\alpha$2$\beta$3$\gamma$2) and two mutant ($\alpha$1$\beta$2(N289M)$\gamma$2 and $\alpha$2$\beta$3(N290M)$\gamma$2) GABA(A) receptor channels were introduced into Xenopus oocytes and studied with two-electrode voltage-clamp. AZD3043 potentiated and directly activated the $\alpha$1$\beta$2$\gamma$2, $\alpha$2$\beta$2$\gamma$2 and $\alpha$2$\beta$3$\gamma$2 GABA(A) receptor subtypes. Moreover, both potency and efficacy of AZD3043 were reduced at the mutant $\alpha$1$\beta$2(N289M)$\gamma$2 and $\alpha$2$\beta$3(N290M)$\gamma$2 subtypes. AZD3043 increased the GABA response also in GABA(A) receptors lacking the $\gamma$2-subunit, i.e. $\alpha$1$\beta$2. In conclusion, AZD3043 is a positive modulator and a direct agonist at human GABA(A) receptors and is not dependent on the $\gamma$2-subunit for its effect. Similar to propofol, the effect of AZD3043 is dramatically reduced by point-mutations in the $\beta$2(N289M) and $\beta$3(N290M) subunits, indicating similar molecular mechanisms of action for propofol and AZD3043 at the human GABA(A) receptor.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Many of the general anesthetics, currently used in clinical practice, work through interactions with GABA(A) receptors. The last 2 decades has witnessed substantial progress in defining the molecular mechanisms by which general anesthetics interact with GABA(A) receptor sites. However, despite progress in the basic scientific understanding of the mechanism of action of general anesthetics, introduction of novel general anesthetic agents into clinical practice has proven quite challenging.

AREAS COVERED: The focus of this review is on the potential for translating basic science advances into the design of new and improved anesthetics. The authors review general anesthetics in current practice as well as anesthetic drug candidates in development and discuss the potential for novel anesthetic drug development.

EXPERT OPINION: Opportunities for the discovery of new anesthetics include: computational-based ligand-design, structure-based design, re-exploration of old structure-activity data, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity predictions and high-throughput screening. The authors believe a lack of high-resolution three-dimensional structures of mammalian GABA(A) receptors remains a significant limiting factor in structure-based anesthetic drug design.},

@article{Olsen2011a,
abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge of detailed biochemical evidence for the role of $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA(A)-Rs) in the mechanisms of general anesthesia.

PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: With the knowledge that all general anesthetics positively modulate GABA(A)-R-mediated inhibitory transmission, site-directed mutagenesis comparing sequences of GABA(A)-R subunits of varying sensitivity led to identification of amino acid residues in the transmembrane domain that are critical for the drug actions in vitro. Using a photo incorporable analogue of the general anesthetic, R(+)etomidate, we identified two transmembrane amino acids that were affinity labelled in purified bovine brain GABA(A)-R. Homology protein structural modelling positions these two residues, $\alpha$M1-11' and $\beta$M3-4', close to each other in a single type of intersubunit etomidate binding pocket at the $\beta$/$\alpha$ interface. This position would be appropriate for modulation of agonist channel gating. Overall, available information suggests that these two etomidate binding residues are allosterically coupled to sites of action of steroids, barbiturates, volatile agents, and propofol, but not alcohols. Residue $\alpha$/$\beta$M2-15' is probably not a binding site but allosterically coupled to action of volatile agents, alcohols, and intravenous agents, and $\alpha$/$\beta$M1-(-2') is coupled to action of intravenous agents.

CONCLUSIONS: Establishment of a coherent and consistent structural model of the GABA(A)-R lends support to the conclusion that general anesthetics can modulate function by binding to appropriate domains on the protein. Genetic engineering of mice with mutation in some of these GABA(A)-R residues are insensitive to general anesthetics in vivo, suggesting that further analysis of these domains could lead to development of more potent and specific drugs.},

abstract = {In gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors, the structural elements that couple ligand binding to channel opening remain poorly defined. Here, site-directed mutagenesis was used to determine if Loop 9 on the non-GABA binding site interface of the beta2-subunit may be involved in GABA(A) receptor activation. Specifically, residues Gly(170)-Gln(185) of the beta2-subunit were mutated to alanine, co-expressed with wild-type alpha1- and gamma2S-subunits in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and assayed for their activation by GABA, the intravenous anesthetic propofol and the endogenous neurosteroid pregnanolone using whole cell macroscopic recordings. Three mutants, G170A, V175A, and G177A, produced 2.5-, 6.7-, and 5.6-fold increases in GABA EC(50) whereas one mutant, Q185A, produced a 5.2-fold decrease in GABA EC(50). None of the mutations affected the ability of propofol or pregnanolone to potentiate a submaximal GABA response, but the Q185A mutant exhibited 8.3- and 3.5-fold increases in the percent direct activation by propofol and pregnanolone, respectively. Mutant Q185A receptors also had an increased leak current that was sensitive to picrotoxin, indicating an increased gating efficiency. Further Q185E, Q185L, and Q185W substitutions revealed a strong correlation between the hydropathy of the amino acid at this position and the GABA EC(50). Taken together, these results indicate that beta2 Loop 9 is involved in receptor activation by GABA, propofol, and pregnanolone and that beta2(Q185) participates in hydrophilic interactions that are important for stabilizing the closed state of the GABA(A) receptor.},

abstract = {Etomidate and propofol have clearly distinguishable effects on the central nervous system. However, studies in knock-in mice provided evidence that these agents produce anesthesia via largely overlapping molecular targets, namely GABA(A) receptors containing beta3 subunits. Here the authors address the question as to whether etomidate and propofol are targeting different subpopulations of beta3 subunit containing GABA(A) receptors. The effects of etomidate and propofol (0.5 muM and 1.0 muM) on spontaneous activity of neocortical neurons were investigated in organotypic slice cultures from wild-type and beta3(N265M) knock-in mice. Firing patterns were characterized by mean burst length and number of action potentials per burst. Additionally, etomidate and propofol actions on GABA(A) receptor-mediated currents were investigated by whole-cell voltage clamp recordings. On the network level, the duration of spontaneously occurring bursts of action potentials was decreased by etomidate but increased by propofol in the wild-type. The effects of etomidate were abolished in beta3(N265M) mutant slices while those of propofol were qualitatively inverted. On the receptor level, GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibition of cortical neurons was modulated by etomidate and propofol in different ways. Again, drug-specific actions of etomidate and propofol were largely attenuated by the beta3(N265M) mutation. Etomidate and propofol alter the firing patterns and GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibition of neocortical neurons in different ways. This suggests that etomidate and propofol act via non-uniform molecular targets. Because the major effects induced by these anesthetics were attenuated by the beta3(N265M) mutation, different subpopulations of beta3-containing GABA(A) receptors are likely to be involved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABAA-R) beta subunits are critical targets for the actions for several intravenous general anesthetics, but the precise nature of the anesthetic binding sites are unknown. In addition, little is known about the role the fourth transmembrane (M4) segment of the receptor plays in receptor function. The aim of this study was to better define the propofol binding site on the GABAA-R by conducting a tryptophan scan in the M4 segment of the beta2 subunit.

METHODS: Seven tryptophan mutations were introduced into the C-terminal end of the M4 segment of the GABAA-R beta2 subunit. GABAA-R subunit complementary DNAs were transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells grown on glass coverslips. After transfection (36-72 h), coverslips were transferred to a perfusion chamber to assay receptor function. Cells were whole cell patch clamped and exposed to GABA, propofol, etomidate, and pregnenolone. Chemicals were delivered to the cells using two 10-channel infusion pumps and a rapid solution exchanger.

RESULTS: All tryptophan mutations were well tolerated, and with one exception, all resulted in minimal changes in receptor activation by GABA. One mutation, beta2(Y444W), selectively suppressed the ability of propofol to enhance receptor function while retaining normal sensitivity to etomidate and pregnenolone.

CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a mutation that selectively reduces propofol sensitivity without altering the action of etomidate. The reduction in propofol sensitivity is consistent with the loss of a hydrogen bond within the propofol binding site. These results also suggest a possible orientation of the propofol molecule within its binding site.},

In this molecular modelling study, two distinct binding cavities were identified within the beta(2) subunit of the transmembrane domain in a molecular model of the GABA(A) protein. The first, located near the centre of the alpha-helical bundle, contains Asn265 (TM2), which is essential for modulation by etomidate. The second, located near the TM1, TM3 and TM4 segments close to the membrane-extracellular interface, is capped by Met286 (TM3), a residue thought to be involved in the propofol binding site.

abstract = {For many general anesthetics, their molecular basis of action involves interactions with GABA(A) receptors. Anesthetics produce concentration-dependent effects on GABA(A) receptors. Low concentrations potentiate submaximal GABA-induced currents. Higher concentrations directly activate the receptors. Functional effects of anesthetics have been characterized, but little is known about the conformational changes they induce. We probed anesthetic-induced conformational changes in the M2 membrane-spanning, channel-lining segment using disulfide trapping between engineered cysteines. Previously, we showed that oxidation by copper phenanthroline in the presence of GABA of the M2 6' cysteine mutants, alpha(1)T261Cbeta(1)T256C and alpha(1)beta(1)T256C resulted in formation of an intersubunit disulfide bond between the adjacent beta-subunits that significantly increased the channels' spontaneous open probability. Oxidation in GABA's absence had no effect. We examined the effect on alpha(1)T261Cbeta(1)T256C and on alpha(1)beta(1)T256C of oxidation by copper phenanthroline in the presence of potentiating and directly activating concentrations of the general anesthetics propofol, pentobarbital, and isoflurane. Oxidation in the presence of potentiating concentration of anesthetics had little effect. Oxidation in the presence of directly activating anesthetic concentrations significantly increased the channels' spontaneous open probability. We infer that activation by anesthetics and GABA induces a similar conformational change at the M2 segment 6' position that is related to channel opening.},

abstract = {Background: Agents belonging to diverse chemical classes are used clinically as general anesthetics. The molecular targets mediating their actions are however still only poorly defined. Both chemical diversity and substantial differences in the clinical actions of general anesthetics suggest that general anesthetic agents may have distinct pharmacological targets. It was demonstrated previously that the immobilizing action of etomidate and propofol is completely, and the immobilizing action of isoflurane partly mediated, by beta 3-containing GABA(A) receptors. This was determined by using the beta 3(N265M) mice, which carry a point mutation known to decrease the actions of general anesthetics at recombinant GABA(A) receptors. In this communication, we analyzed the contribution of beta 3-containing GABA(A) receptors to the pharmacological actions of isoflurane, etomidate and propofol by means of beta 3( N265M) mice.Results: Isoflurane decreased core body temperature and heart rate to a smaller degree in beta 3( N265M) mice than in wild type mice, indicating a minor but significant role of beta 3-containing GABA(A) receptors in these actions. Prolonged time intervals in the ECG and increased heart rate variability were indistinguishable between genotypes, suggesting no involvement of beta 3-containing GABA(A) receptors. The anterograde amnesic action of propofol was indistinguishable in beta 3( N265M) and wild type mice, suggesting that it is independent of beta 3-containing GABA(A) receptors. The increase of heart rate variability and prolongation of ECG intervals by etomidate and propofol were also less pronounced in beta 3( N265M) mice than in wild type mice, pointing to a limited involvement of beta 3-containing GABAA receptors in these actions. The lack of etomidate- and propofol-induced immobilization in beta 3( N265M) mice was also observed in congenic 129X1/SvJ and C57BL/6J backgrounds, indicating that this phenotype is stable across different backgrounds.Conclusion: Our results provide evidence for a defined role of beta 3-containing GABA(A) receptors in mediating some, but not all, of the actions of general anesthetics, and confirm the multisite model of general anesthetic action. This pharmacological separation of anesthetic endpoints also suggests that subtype-selective substances with an improved side-effect profile may be developed.},

abstract = {Propofol is the most important intravenous general anesthetic in current clinical use. It acts by potentiating GABAA ($\gamma$-aminobutyric acid type A) receptors, but where it binds to this receptor is not known and has been a matter of some debate. We synthesized a new propofol analog photolabeling reagent whose biological activity is very similar to that of propofol. We confirmed that this reagent labeled known propofol binding sites in human serum albumin that have been identified using X-ray crystallography. Using a combination of protiated and deuterated versions of the reagent to label mammalian receptors in intact membranes, we identified a new binding site for propofol in GABAA receptors consisting of both $\beta$3 homopentamers and $\alpha$1$\beta$3 heteropentamers. The binding site is located within the $\beta$ subunit at the interface between the transmembrane domains and the extracellular domain and lies close to known determinants of anesthetic sensitivity in the transmembrane segments TM1 and TM2.},

@article{Nury2010,
abstract = {The crystal structure of the extracellular domain (ECD) of the pentameric ligand-gated ion-channel from Gloeobacter violaceus (GLIC) was solved at neutral pH at 2.3 A resolution in two crystal forms, showing a surprising hexameric quaternary structure with a 6-fold axis replacing the expected 5-fold axis. While each subunit retains the usual beta-sandwich immunoglobulin-like fold, small deviations from the whole GLIC structure indicate zones of differential flexibility. The changes in interface between two adjacent subunits in the pentamer and the hexamer can be described in a downward translation by one inter-strand distance and a global rotation of the second subunit, using the first one for superposition. While global characteristics of the interface, such as the buried accessible surface area, do not change very much, most of the atom-atom interactions are rearranged. It thus appears that the transmembrane domain is necessary for the proper oligomeric assembly of GLIC and that there is an intrinsic plasticity or polymorphism in possible subunit-subunit interfaces at the ECD level, the latter behaving as a monomer in solution. Possible functional implications of these novel structural data are discussed in the context of the allosteric transition of this family of proteins. In addition, we propose a novel way to quantify elastic energy stored in the interface between subunits, which indicates a tenser interface for the open form than for the closed form (rest state). The hexameric or pentameric forms of the ECD have a similar negative curvature in their subunit-subunit interface, while acetylcholine binding proteins have a smaller and positive curvature that increases from the apo to the holo form.},

abstract = {General anesthetics are essential to modern medicine, and yet a detailed understanding of their mechanisms of action is lacking. General anesthetics were once believed to be "drugs without receptors" but this view has been largely abandoned. During the past decade significant progress in our understanding of the mechanisms of general anesthetic action at the molecular, cellular and neural systems levels has been made. Different molecular targets in various regions of the nervous system are involved in the multiple components of anesthetic action, and these targets can vary between specific anesthetics. Neurotransmitter-gated ion channels, particularly receptors for GABA and glutamate, are modulated by most anesthetics, at both synaptic and extrasynaptic sites, and additional ion channels and receptors are also being recognized as important targets for general anesthetics. In this article, these developments, which have important implications for the development of more-selective anesthetics, are reviewed in the context of recent advances in ion channel structure and function.},

abstract = {General anesthetics are widely used in clinical practice. On the molecular level, these compounds have been shown to modulate the activity of various neuronal ion channels. However, the functional relevance of identified sites in mediating essential components of the general anesthetic state, such as immobility and hypnosis, is still unknown. Using gene-targeting technology, we generated mice harboring a subtle point mutation (N265M) in the second transmembrane region of the beta3 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor. In these mice, the suppression of noxious-evoked movements in response to the intravenous anesthetics etomidate and propofol is completely abolished, while only slightly decreased with the volatile anesthetics enflurane and halothane. beta3(N265M) mice also display a profound reduction in the loss of righting reflex duration in response to intravenous but not volatile anesthetics. In addition, electrophysiological recordings revealed that anesthetic agents were significantly less effective in enhancing GABA(A) receptor-mediated currents, and in decreasing spontaneous action potential firing in cortical brain slices derived from mutant mice. Taken together, our results demonstrate that a single molecular target, and indeed a specific residue (N265) located within the GABA(A) receptor beta3 subunit, is a major determinant of behavioral responses evoked by the intravenous anesthetics etomidate and propofol, whereas volatile anesthetics appear to act via a broader spectrum of molecular targets.},

abstract = {The cardiac muscle protein titin, responsible for developing passive elasticity and extensibility of muscle, possesses about 40 immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains in its I-band region. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and steered molecular dynamics (SMD) have been successfully combined to investigate the reversible unfolding of individual Ig domains. However, previous SMD studies of titin I-band modules have been restricted to I27, the only structurally known Ig domain from the distal region of the titin I-band. In this paper we report SMD simulations unfolding I1, the first structurally available Ig domain from the proximal region of the titin I-band. The simulations are carried out with a view toward upcoming atomic force microscopy experiments. Both constant velocity and constant force stretching have been employed to model mechanical unfolding of oxidized I1, which has a disulfide bond bridging beta-strands C and E, as well as reduced I1, in which the disulfide bridge is absent. The simulations reveal that I1 is protected against external stress mainly through six interstrand hydrogen bonds between its A and B beta-strands. The disulfide bond enhances the mechanical stability of oxidized I1 domains by restricting the rupture of backbone hydrogen bonds between the A'- and G-strands. The disulfide bond also limits the maximum extension of I1 to approximately 220 A. Comparison of the unfolding pathways of I1 and I27 are provided and implications to AFM experiments are discussed.},

A decline in GABAAR signalling triggers hyperactive neurological disorders such as insomnia, anxiety and epilepsy. Here we present the first three-dimensional structure of a GABAAR, the human $\beta$3 homopentamer, at 3 {\AA} resolution. This structure reveals architectural elements unique to eukaryotic Cys-loop receptors, explains the mechanistic consequences of multiple human disease mutations and shows an unexpected structural role for a conserved N-linked glycan. The receptor was crystallized bound to a previously unknown agonist, benzamidine, opening a new avenue for the rational design of GABAAR modulators. The channel region forms a closed gate at the base of the pore, representative of a desensitized state. These results offer new insights into the signalling mechanisms of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels and enhance current understanding of GABAergic neurotransmission.},

Factors which affect radii additivity are polyhedral distortion, partial occupancy of cation sites, covalence, and metallic character. Mean Nb5+-O and Mo6+-O octahedral distances are linearly dependent on distortion. A decrease in cation occupancy increases mean Li+-O, Na+-O, and Ag+-O distances in a predictable manner. Covalence strongly shortens Fe2+-X, Co2+-X, Ni2+-X, Mn2+-X, Cu+-X, Ag+-X, and M-H- bonds as the electronegativity of X or M decreases. Smaller effects are seen for Zn2+-X, Cd2+-X, In2+-X, pb2+-X, and TI+-X.

abstract = {The $\alpha$1$\beta$2$\gamma$2 gamma-aminobutyric type A receptor (GABA(A)R) is one of the most widely expressed GABA(A)R subtypes in the mammalian brain. GABA(A)Rsbelonging to the Cys-loop superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels have been identified as key targets for many clinical drugs, and the motions that govern the gating mechanism are still not well understood. In this study, an open-state GABA(A)R was constructed using the structure of the glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl), which has a high sequence identity to GABA(A)R. A closed-state model was constructed using the structure of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). Molecular dynamics simulations of the open-state and closed-state GABA(A)R were performed. We calculated the electrostatic potential of the two conformations, the pore radius of the two ion channels and the root-mean-square fluctuation. We observed the presence of two positively charged girdles around the ion channel and found flexible regions in the GABA(A)R. Then, the free-energy of chloride ion permeations through the closed-state and open-state G GABA(A)R has been estimated using adaptive biasing force (ABF) simulation. For the closed-state G GABA(A)R, we observed two major energy barriers for chloride ion translocation in the transmembrane domain (TMD). For the open-state GABA(A)R, there was only one energy barrier formed by two Thr261 ($\alpha$1), two Thr255 ($\beta$2) and one Thr271 ($\gamma$2). By using ABF simulation, the overall free-energy profile is obtained for Cl(-) transporting through GABA(A)R, which gives a complete map of the ion channel of Cl(-) permeation.},

abstract = {Real-world observable physical and chemical characteristics are increasingly being calculated from the 3D structures of biomolecules. Methods for calculating pK(a) values, binding constants of ligands, and changes in protein stability are readily available, but often the limiting step in computational biology is the conversion of PDB structures into formats ready for use with biomolecular simulation software. The continued sophistication and integration of biomolecular simulation methods for systems- and genome-wide studies requires a fast, robust, physically realistic and standardized protocol for preparing macromolecular structures for biophysical algorithms. As described previously, the PDB2PQR web server addresses this need for electrostatic field calculations (Dolinsky et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 32, W665-W667, 2004). Here we report the significantly expanded PDB2PQR that includes the following features: robust standalone command line support, improved pK(a) estimation via the PROPKA framework, ligand parameterization via PEOE{\_}PB charge methodology, expanded set of force fields and easily incorporated user-defined parameters via XML input files, and improvement of atom addition and optimization code. These features are available through a new web interface (http://pdb2pqr.sourceforge.net/), which offers users a wide range of options for PDB file conversion, modification and parameterization.},

@article{Comer2014,
abstract = {In the host of numerical schemes devised to calculate free energy differences by way of geometric transformations, the adaptive biasing force algorithm has emerged as a promising route to map complex free-energy landscapes. It relies upon the simple concept that as a simulation progresses, a continuously updated biasing force is added to the equations of motion, such that in the long-time limit it yields a Hamiltonian devoid of an average force acting along the transition coordinate of interest. This means that sampling proceeds uniformly on a flat free-energy surface, thus providing reliable free-energy estimates. Much of the appeal of the algorithm to the practitioner is in its physically intuitive underlying ideas and the absence of any requirements for prior knowledge about free-energy landscapes. Since its inception in 2001, the adaptive biasing force scheme has been the subject of considerable attention, from in-depth mathematical analysis of convergence properties to novel developments and extensions. The method has also been successfully applied to many challenging problems in chemistry and biology. In this contribution, the method is presented in a comprehensive, self-contained fashion, discussing with a critical eye its properties, applicability and inherent limitations, as well as introducing novel extensions. Through free-energy calculations prototypical molecular systems, many methodological aspects are examined, from stratification strategies to overcoming the so-called hidden barriers in orthogonal space, relevant not only to the adaptive biasing force algorithm, but also to other importance-sampling schemes. On the basis of the discussions in this paper, a number of good practices for improving the efficiency and reliability of the computed free-energy differences are proposed.},

abstract = {Association of unconstrained molecular dynamics (MD) and the formalisms of thermodynamic integration and average force [Darve and Pohorille, J. Chem. Phys. 115, 9169 (2001)] have been employed to determine potentials of mean force. When implemented in a general MD code, the additional computational effort, compared to other standard, unconstrained simulations, is marginal. The force acting along a chosen reaction coordinate xi is estimated from the individual forces exerted on the chemical system and accumulated as the simulation progresses. The estimated free energy derivative computed for small intervals of xi is canceled by an adaptive bias to overcome the barriers of the free energy landscape. Evolution of the system along the reaction coordinate is, thus, limited by its sole self-diffusion properties. The illustrative examples of the reversible unfolding of deca-L-alanine, the association of acetate and guanidinium ions in water, the dimerization of methane in water, and its transfer across the water liquid-vapor interface are examined to probe the efficiency of the method.},

@article{Darve2008,
abstract = {In free energy calculations based on thermodynamic integration, it is necessary to compute the derivatives of the free energy as a function of one (scalar case) or several (vector case) order parameters. We derive in a compact way a general formulation for evaluating these derivatives as the average of a mean force acting on the order parameters, which involves first derivatives with respect to both Cartesian coordinates and time. This is in contrast with the previously derived formulas, which require first and second derivatives of the order parameter with respect to Cartesian coordinates. As illustrated in a concrete example, the main advantage of this new formulation is the simplicity of its use, especially for complicated order parameters. It is also straightforward to implement in a molecular dynamics code, as can be seen from the pseudocode given at the end. We further discuss how the approach based on time derivatives can be combined with the adaptive biasing force method, an enhanced sampling technique that rapidly yields uniform sampling of the order parameters, and by doing so greatly improves the efficiency of free energy calculations. Using the backbone dihedral angles Phi and Psi in N-acetylalanyl-N'-methylamide as a numerical example, we present a technique to reconstruct the free energy from its derivatives, a calculation that presents some difficulties in the vector case because of the statistical errors affecting the derivatives.},

These simulations reproduce experimental measurements suggesting that cholesterol prefers to be solvated by saturated acyl chains and has a low affinity for polyunsaturated fatty acids. Analyses of the simulation trajectory provide a detailed picture of both the transverse and lateral structures of the lipid bilayer membrane, along with a description of lipid and cholesterol dynamics at high temporal resolution. Comparison with a previous simulation of a pure phospholipid bilayer allows an atomic-level description of the changes in membrane structure and dynamics resulting from incorporation of cholesterol. The observed differential cholesterol interactions with saturated and polyunsaturated lipids provide a mechanism for the formation of laterally inhomogeneous membranes; thus, the simulation provides molecular-level insight into the formation of lipid rafts.},

Molecules are displayed as one or more "representations," in which each representation embodies a particular rendering method and coloring scheme for a selected subset of atoms. The atoms displayed in each representation are chosen using an extensive atom selection syntax, which includes Boolean operators and regular expressions. VMD provides a complete graphical user interface for program control, as well as a text interface using the Tcl embeddable parser to allow for complex scripts with variable substitution, control loops, and function calls. Full session logging is supported, which produces a VMD command script for later playback. High-resolution raster images of displayed molecules may be produced by generating input scripts for use by a number of photorealistic image-rendering applications. VMD has also been expressly designed with the ability to animate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories, imported either from files or from a direct connection to a running MD simulation. VMD is the visualization component of MDScope, a set of tools for interactive problem solving in structural biology, which also includes the parallel MD program NAMD, and the MDCOMM software used to connect the visualization and simulation programs.

abstract = {New protein parameters are reported for the all-atom empirical energy function in the CHARMM program. The parameter evaluation was based on a self-consistent approach designed to achieve a balance between the internal (bonding) and interaction (nonbonding) terms of the force field and among the solvent-solvent, solvent-solute, and solute-solute interactions. Optimization of the internal parameters used experimental gas-phase geometries, vibrational spectra, and torsional energy surfaces supplemented with ab initio results. The peptide backbone bonding parameters were optimized with respect to data for N-methylacetamide and the alanine dipeptide. The interaction parameters, particularly the atomic charges, were determined by fitting ab initio interaction energies and geometries of complexes between water and model compounds that represented the backbone and the various side chains. In addition, dipole moments, experimental heats and free energies of vaporization, solvation and sublimation, molecular volumes, and crystal pressures and structures were used in the optimization. The resulting protein parameters were tested by applying them to noncyclic tripeptide crystals, cyclic peptide crystals, and the proteins crambin, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, and carbonmonoxy myoglobin in vacuo and in crystals. A detailed analysis of the relationship between the alanine dipeptide potential energy surface and calculated protein $\phi$, $\chi$ angles was made and used in optimizing the peptide group torsional parameters. The results demonstrate that use of ab initio structural and energetic data by themselves are not sufficient to obtain an adequate backbone representation for peptides and proteins in solution and in crystals. Extensive comparisons between molecular dynamics simulations and experimental data for polypeptides and proteins were performed for both structural and dynamic properties. Energy minimization and dynamics simulations for crystals demonstrate that the latter are needed to obtain meaningful comparisons with experimental crystal structures. The presented parameters, in combination with the previously published CHARMM all-atom parameters for nucleic acids and lipids, provide a consistent set for condensed-phase simulations of a wide variety of molecules of biological interest.},

This article, directed to novices as well as experts, first introduces concepts and methods used in the NAMD program, describing the classical molecular dynamics force field, equations of motion, and integration methods along with the efficient electrostatics evaluation algorithms employed and temperature and pressure controls used.

abstract = {A significant modification to the additive all-atom CHARMM lipid force field (FF) is developed and applied to phospholipid bilayers with both choline and ethanolamine containing head groups and with both saturated and unsaturated aliphatic chains. Motivated by the current CHARMM lipid FF (C27 and C27r) systematically yielding values of the surface area per lipid that are smaller than experimental estimates and gel-like structures of bilayers well above the gel transition temperature, selected torsional, Lennard-Jones and partial atomic charge parameters were modified by targeting both quantum mechanical (QM) and experimental data. QM calculations ranging from high-level ab initio calculations on small molecules to semiempirical QM studies on a 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayer in combination with experimental thermodynamic data were used as target data for parameter optimization. These changes were tested with simulations of pure bilayers at high hydration of the following six lipids: DPPC, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC), 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DLPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (POPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE); simulations of a low hydration DOPC bilayer were also performed. Agreement with experimental surface area is on average within 2{\%}, and the density profiles agree well with neutron and X-ray diffraction experiments. NMR deuterium order parameters (S(CD)) are well predicted with the new FF, including proper splitting of the S(CD) for the aliphatic carbon adjacent to the carbonyl for DPPC, POPE, and POPC bilayers. The area compressibility modulus and frequency dependence of (13)C NMR relaxation rates of DPPC and the water distribution of low hydration DOPC bilayers also agree well with experiment. Accordingly, the presented lipid FF, referred to as C36, allows for molecular dynamics simulations to be run in the tensionless ensemble (NPT), and is anticipated to be of utility for simulations of pure lipid systems as well as heterogeneous systems including membrane proteins.},

abstract = {Neuronal activity modulates the membrane diffusion of postsynaptic $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs), thereby regulating the efficacy of GABAergic synapses. The K289M mutation in GABA(A)Rs subunit $\gamma$2 has been associated with the generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) syndrome. This mutation accelerates receptor deactivation and therefore reduces inhibitory synaptic transmission. Yet, it is not clear why this mutation specifically promotes febrile seizures. We show that upon raising temperature both the number of GABA(A)Rs clusters and the frequency of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents decreased in neurons expressing the K289M mutant but not wild-type (WT) recombinant $\gamma$2. Single-particle tracking experiments revealed that raising temperature increases the membrane diffusion of synaptic GABA(A)Rs containing the K289M mutant but not WT recombinant $\gamma$2. This effect was mediated by enhanced neuronal activity as it was blocked by glutamate receptor antagonists and was mimicked by the convulsant 4-aminopyridine. Our data suggest the K289M mutation in $\gamma$2 confers GABA(A)Rs with enhanced sensitivity of their membrane diffusion to neuronal activity. Enhanced activity during hyperthermia may then trigger the escape of receptors from synapses and thereby further reduce the efficacy of GABAergic inhibition. Alteration of the membrane diffusion of neurotransmitter receptors therefore represents a new mechanism in human epilepsy.},

abstract = {With a worldwide incidence as high as 6.7{\%} of children, febrile seizures are one of the most common reasons for seeking pediatric care, but the mechanisms underlying generation of febrile seizures are poorly understood. Febrile seizures have been suspected to have a genetic basis, and recently, mutations in GABAA receptor and sodium channel genes have been identified that are associated with febrile seizures and generalized seizures with febrile seizures plus pedigrees. Pentameric GABAA receptors mediate the majority of fast synaptic inhibition in the brain and are composed of combinations of alpha(1-6), beta(1-3), and gamma(1-3) subunits. In alphabetagamma2 GABAA receptors, the gamma2 subunit is critical for receptor trafficking, clustering, and synaptic maintenance, and mutations in the gamma2 subunit have been monogenically associated with autosomal dominant transmission of febrile seizures. Here, we report that whereas trafficking of wild-type alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors was slightly temperature dependent, trafficking of mutant alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors containing gamma2 subunit mutations [gamma2(R43Q), gamma2(K289M), and gamma2(Q351X)] associated with febrile seizures was highly temperature dependent. In contrast, trafficking of mutant alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors containing an alpha1 subunit mutation [alpha1(A322D)] not associated with febrile seizures was not highly temperature dependent. Brief increases in temperature from 37 to 40 degrees C rapidly ({\textless}10 min) impaired trafficking and/or accelerated endocytosis of heterozygous mutant alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors containing gamma2 subunit mutations associated with febrile seizures but not of wild-type alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors or heterozygous mutant alpha1(A322D)beta2gamma2 receptors, suggesting that febrile seizures may be produced by a temperature-induced dynamic reduction of susceptible mutant surface GABAA receptors in response to fever.},

abstract = {A recent report indicates that a lysine-to-methionine mutation (K289M) in the gamma2 subunit of a human gamma-aminobutyric acid neurotransmitter receptor, the GABA(A) receptor, is linked to generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures [Baulac et al. (2001) Nat. Genet. 28, 46-48]. This mutation caused a decreased current response to GABA [Baulac et al. (2001) Nat. Genet. 28, 46-48]. Here we determine changes that occur in the mechanism of opening and closing of transmembrane channels formed by the GABA(A) receptor as a result of this mutation. The K289M mutation was introduced into the gamma2L subunit of the rat GABA(A) receptor, and the mutated subunit was coexpressed with the alpha1 and beta2 subunits in HEK293 cells. Transient kinetic techniques suitable for investigating reactions on cell surfaces with a microsecond-to-millisecond time resolution [Hess, G. P., and Grewer, C. (1998) Methods Enzymol. 291, 443-473] were used. They allow one to determine not only the channel-opening probability and rates of receptor desensitization but also the opening and closing rates of the mutated GABA(A) receptor channel. The channel-opening equilibrium constant of the mutated receptor was found to be 5-fold lower than that of the wild type. We calculated that this decrease in the channel-opening equilibrium accounts for the dysfunction of the mutated receptor. We discuss how a knowledge of the mechanism of the mutated receptor indicates an approach for alleviating this dysfunction.},

abstract = {The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor system, the main fast-acting inhibitory neurotransmitter system in the brain, is the pharmacological target for many drugs used clinically to treat, for example, anxiety disorders and epilepsy, and to induce and maintain sedation, sleep, and anesthesia. These drugs facilitate the function of pentameric GABA(A) receptors that exhibit widespread expression in all brain regions and large structural and pharmacological heterogeneity as a result of composition from a repertoire of 19 subunit variants. One of the main problems in clinical use of GABA(A) receptor agonists is the development of tolerance. Most drugs, in long-term use and during withdrawal, have been associated with important modulations of the receptor subunit expression in brain-region-specific manner, participating in the mechanisms of tolerance and dependence. In most cases, the molecular mechanisms of regulation of subunit expression are poorly known, partly as a result of neurobiological adaptation to altered neuronal function. More knowledge has been obtained on the mechanisms of GABA(A) receptor trafficking and cell surface expression and the processes that may contribute to tolerance, although their possible pharmacological regulation is not known. Drug development for neuropsychiatric disorders, including epilepsy, alcoholism, schizophrenia, and anxiety, has been ongoing for several years. One key step to extend drug development related to GABA(A) receptors is likely to require deeper understanding of the adaptational mechanisms of neurons, receptors themselves with interacting proteins, and finally receptor subunits during drug action and in neuropsychiatric disease processes.},

A decline in GABAAR signalling triggers hyperactive neurological disorders such as insomnia, anxiety and epilepsy. Here we present the first three-dimensional structure of a GABAAR, the human $\beta$3 homopentamer, at 3 {\AA} resolution. This structure reveals architectural elements unique to eukaryotic Cys-loop receptors, explains the mechanistic consequences of multiple human disease mutations and shows an unexpected structural role for a conserved N-linked glycan. The receptor was crystallized bound to a previously unknown agonist, benzamidine, opening a new avenue for the rational design of GABAAR modulators. The channel region forms a closed gate at the base of the pore, representative of a desensitized state. These results offer new insights into the signalling mechanisms of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels and enhance current understanding of GABAergic neurotransmission.},

Theoretical results may be used for rationalizing or predicting experimental results, or for suggesting working hypotheses.

abstract = {The theoretical prediction of water drying transitions near nonpolar surfaces has stimulated an intensive search for biological processes exploiting this extreme form of hydrophobicity. Here we quantitatively demonstrate that drying of a hydrophobic constriction is the major determinant of ion conductance in the GLIC pentameric ion channel. Molecular-dynamics simulations show that in the closed state, the channel conductance is ∼12 orders-of-magnitude lower than in the open state. This large drop in conductance is remarkable because even in the functionally closed conformation the pore constriction remains wide enough for the passage of sodium ions, aided by a continuous bridge of ∼12 water molecules. However, we find that the free energy cost of hydrating the hydrophobic gate is large, accounting almost entirely for the energetic barrier blocking ion passage. The free energies of transferring a sodium ion into a prehydrated gate in functionally closed and open states differ by only 1.2 kcal/mol, compared to an 11 kcal/mol difference in the costs of hydrating the hydrophobic gate. Conversely, ion desolvation effects play only minor roles in GLIC ion channel gating. Our simulations help rationalize experiments probing the gating kinetics of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in response to mutations of pore-lining residues. The molecular character and phase behavior of water should thus be included in quantitative descriptions of ion channel gating.},

abstract = {Nerve signaling in humans and chemical sensing in bacteria both rely on the controlled opening and closing of the ion-conducting pore in pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. With the help of a multiscale simulation approach that combines mixed elastic network model calculations with molecular dynamics simulations, we study the opening and closing of the pore in Gloeobacter violaceus channel GLIC at atomic resolution. In our simulations of the GLIC transmembrane domain, we first verify that the two endpoints of the transition are open and closed to sodium ion conduction, respectively. We then show that a two-stage tilting of the pore-lining helices induces cooperative drying and iris-like closing of the channel pore. From the free energy profile of the gating transition and from unrestrained simulations, we conclude that the pore of the isolated GLIC transmembrane domain closes spontaneously. The mechanical work of opening the pore is performed primarily on the M2-M3 loop. Strong interactions of this short and conserved loop with the extracellular domain are therefore crucial to couple ligand binding to channel opening.},

Regardless of which subunit contained the mutation, mutant GABA(A) receptors assembled poorly into functional cell surface receptors. The low level of functional expression gives rise to reduced GABA EC50s (alpha1(R43Q)beta2gamma2 and alpha1beta2(R43Q)gamma2) or reduced benzodiazepine potentiation of GABA-evoked currents (alpha1beta2gamma2(R43Q)). We determined that a 15-residue peptide surrounding R43 is capable of subunit binding, with a profile that reflected the orientation of subunits in the pentameric receptor. Subunit binding is perturbed when the R43Q mutation is present suggesting that this residue is critical for the formation of inter-subunit contacts at (+) interfaces of GABAA subunits. Rather than being excluded from receptors, gamma2(R43Q) may form non-productive subunit interactions leading to a dominant negative effect on other receptor subtypes.},

abstract = {Most human idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGEs) are polygenic, but virtually nothing is known of the molecular basis for any of the complex epilepsies. Recently, two GABAA receptor delta subunit variants (E177A, R220H) were proposed as susceptibility alleles for generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. In human embryonic kidney 293T cells, recombinant halpha1beta2delta(E177A) and halpha1beta2delta(R220H) receptor currents were reduced, but the basis for the current reduction was not determined. We examined the mechanistic basis for the current reduction produced by these variants using the halpha4beta2delta receptor, an isoform more physiologically relevant and linked to epileptogenesis, by characterizing the effects of these variants on receptor cell surface expression and single-channel gating properties. Expression of variant alpha4beta2delta(R220H) receptors resulted in a decrease in surface receptor proteins, and a smaller, but significant, reduction was observed for variant alpha4beta2delta(E177A) receptors. For both variants, no significant alterations of surface expression were observed for mixed population of wild-type and variant receptors. The mean open durations of alpha4beta2delta(E177A) and alpha4beta2delta(R220H) receptor single-channel currents were both significantly decreased compared to wild-type receptors. These data suggest that both delta(E177A) and delta(R220H) variants may result in disinhibition in IGEs by similar cellular and molecular mechanisms, and in heterozygously affected individuals, a reduction in channel open duration of delta subunit-containing GABAA receptors may be the major contributor to the epilepsy phenotypes.},

abstract = {Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) belongs to the most common forms of hereditary epilepsy, the idiopathic generalized epilepsies. Although the mode of inheritance is usually complex, mutations in single genes have been shown to cause the disease in some families with autosomal dominant inheritance. The first mutation in a multigeneration JME family has been recently found in the alpha1-subunit of the GABAA receptor (GABRA1), predicting the single amino acid substitution A322D. We further characterized the functional consequences of this mutation by coexpressing alpha1-, beta2- and gamma2-subunits in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. By using an ultrafast application system, mutant receptors have shown reduced macroscopic current amplitudes at saturating GABA concentrations and a highly reduced affinity to GABA compared to the wild-type (WT). Dose-response curves for current amplitudes, activation kinetics, and GABA-dependent desensitization parameters showed a parallel shift towards 30- to 40-fold higher GABA concentrations. Both deactivation and resensitization kinetics were considerably accelerated in mutant channels. In addition, mutant receptors labelled with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were not integrated in the cell membrane, in contrast to WT receptors. Therefore, the A322D mutation leads to a severe loss-of-function of the human GABAA receptor by several mechanisms, including reduced surface expression, reduced GABA-sensitivity, and accelerated deactivation. These molecular defects could decrease and shorten the resulting inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in vivo, which can induce a hyperexcitability of the postsynaptic membrane and explain the occurrence of epileptic seizures.},

A conserved arginine residue in the TM2-TM3 loop of the GABA(A)-R alpha(2) subunit was mutated to alanine, and the mutant alpha(2)(R274A) was co-expressed with wild-type beta(1) and gamma(2S) subunits in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. The GABA EC(50) was increased by about 27-fold in the mutant receptor relative to receptors containing a wild-type alpha(2) subunit. Similarly, the GABA EC(50) at alpha(2)(L277A)beta(1)gamma(2S) and alpha(2)(K279A)beta(1)gamma(2S) GABA(A)-R combinations was increased by 51- and 4-fold, respectively. The alpha(2)(R274A) or alpha(2)(L277A) mutations also reduced the maximal response of piperidine-4-sulfonic acid relative to GABA by converting piperidine-4-sulfonic acid into a weak partial agonist at the GABA(A)-R. Based on these results, we propose that alpha(2)(Arg-274) and alpha(2)(Leu-277) are crucial to the efficient transduction of agonist binding into channel gating at the GABA(A)-R.},

abstract = {Synaptic receptors respond to neurotransmitters by opening an intrinsic ion channel in the final step in synaptic transmission. How binding of the neurotransmitter is conveyed over the long distance to the channel remains a central question in neurobiology. Here we delineate a principal pathway that links neurotransmitter binding to channel gating by using a structural model of the Torpedo acetylcholine receptor at 4-A resolution, recordings of currents through single receptor channels and determinations of energetic coupling between pairs of residues. We show that a pair of invariant arginine and glutamate residues in each receptor alpha-subunit electrostatically links peripheral and inner beta-sheets from the binding domain and positions them to engage with the channel. The key glutamate and flanking valine residues energetically couple to conserved proline and serine residues emerging from the top of the channel-forming alpha-helix, suggesting that this is the point at which the binding domain triggers opening of the channel. The series of interresidue couplings identified here constitutes a primary allosteric pathway that links neurotransmitter binding to channel gating.},

Here we describe a study on the functional characterization of ELIC by electrophysiology and X-ray crystallography. ELIC is activated by a class of primary amines that include the neurotransmitter GABA at high micro- to millimolar concentrations. The ligands bind to a conserved site and evoke currents that slowly desensitize over time. The protein forms cation selective channels with properties that resemble the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The high single channel conductance and the comparably simple functional behavior make ELIC an attractive model system to study general mechanisms of ion conduction and gating in this important family of neurotransmitter receptors.},

abstract = {Orthologs of the pentameric receptor channels that mediate fast synaptic transmission in the central and peripheral nervous systems have been found in several bacterial species and in a single archaea genus. Recent X-ray structures of bacterial and invertebrate pentameric receptors point to a striking conservation of the structural features within the whole family, even between distant prokaryotic and eukaryotic members. These structural data reveal general principles of molecular organization that allow allosteric membrane proteins to mediate chemoelectric transduction. Notably, several conformations have been solved, including open and closed channels with distinct global tertiary and quaternary structure. The data reveal features of the ion channel architecture and of diverse categories of binding sites, such as those that bind orthosteric ligands, including neurotransmitters, and those that bind allosteric modulators, such as general anesthetics, ivermectin, or lipids. In this review, we summarize the most recent data, discuss insights into the mechanism of action in these systems, and elaborate on newly opened avenues for drug design.},

abstract = {This chapter reviews the $\gamma$‐aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor mutations associated with generalized epilepsies. GABA A receptors are the primary mediators of fast inhibitory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system (CNS) and are repeatedly documented to play a critical role in animal models of seizures. GABAA receptors are formed by pentameric assembly of multiple subunit subtypes. The most common GABA A receptors contain two $\alpha$ subunits, two $\beta$ subunits, and a $\gamma$ or $\delta$ subunit. Idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGEs) are characterized by absence, myoclonic, and/or primary generalized tonic–clonic seizures in the absence of structural brain abnormalities and have a genetic basis. Mutations associated with IGEs are also identiﬁed in human GABAA receptor genes. The chapter focuses on the described human GABAA receptor channel epilepsy mutations. The mutations in GABA A receptor $\gamma$2, $\alpha$1, and $\delta$ subunits that are associated with different IGE syndromes are reviewed in the chapter. These mutations alter GABAA receptor gating, expression, and/or trafﬁcking of the receptor to the cell surface, all pathophysiological mechanisms that result in reduced GABA‐evoked currents that in neurons would cause neuronal disinhibition and thus predispose affected patients to manifest seizures.},

abstract = {Modulation of the GABA type A receptor (GABAAR) function by cholesterol and other steroids is documented at the functional level, yet its structural basis is largely unknown. Current data on structurally related modulators suggest that cholesterol binds to subunit interfaces between transmembrane domains of the GABAAR. We construct homology models of a human GABAAR based on the structure of the glutamate-gated chloride channel GluCl of Caenorhabditis elegans. The models show the possibility of previously unreported disulfide bridges linking the M1 and M3 transmembrane helices in the $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ subunits. We discuss the biological relevance of such disulfide bridges. Using our models, we investigate cholesterol binding to intersubunit cavities of the GABAAR transmembrane domain. We find that very similar binding modes are predicted independently by three approaches: analogy with ivermectin in the GluCl crystal structure, automated docking by AutoDock, and spontaneous rebinding events in unbiased molecular dynamics simulations. Taken together, the models and atomistic simulations suggest a somewhat flexible binding mode, with several possible orientations. Finally, we explore the possibility that cholesterol promotes pore opening through a wedge mechanism.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that specific amino acid residues in the putative second transmembrane segment (TM2) of the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor type A (GABAA) receptor play a critical role in the enhancement of GABAA receptor function by halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane. However, very little is known about the actions of sevoflurane and desflurane on recombinant GABAA receptors. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of sevoflurane and desflurane on potentiation of GABA-induced responses in the wild-type GABAA receptor and in receptors mutated in TM2 of the alpha1, alpha 2, or beta 2 subunits.

METHODS: GABAA receptor alpha 1 or alpha 2, beta 2 or beta 3, and gamma 2s subunit cDNAs were expressed for pharmacologic study by transfection of human embryonic kidney 293 cells and assayed using the whole cell voltage clamp technique. Concentration-response curves and EC50 values for agonist were determined in the wild-type alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2s and alpha 2 beta 3 gamma 2s receptors, and in receptors harboring mutations in TM2, such as alpha1(S270W)beta 2 gamma 2s, alpha 1 beta 2(N265W)gamma 2s, and alpha2(S270I)beta 3 gamma 2s. The actions of clinically relevant concentration of volatile anesthetics (isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane) on GABA activated Cl- currents were compared in the wild-type and mutant GABAA receptors.

RESULTS: Both sevoflurane and desflurane potentiated submaximal GABA currents in the wild-type GABAA alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2s receptor and alpha 2 beta 3 gamma 2s receptor. Substitution of Ser270 in TM2 of the alpha subunit by a larger amino acid, tryptophan (W) or isoleucine (I), as in alpha1(S270W)beta 2 gamma 2s and alpha 2(S270I)beta 3 gamma 2s, completely abolished the potentiation of GABA-induced currents by these anesthetic agents. In contrast, mutation of Asn265 in TM2 of the beta subunit to tryptophan (W) did not prevent potentiation of GABA-induced responses. The actions of sevoflurane and desflurane in the wild-type receptor and in mutated receptors were qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those observed for isoflurane.

CONCLUSIONS: Positions Ser270 of the GABAA alpha1 and alpha2 subunits, but not Asn265 in the TM2 of the beta2 subunit, are critical for regulation of the GABAA receptor by sevoflurane and desflurane, as well as isoflurane, consistent with the idea that these three volatile anesthetics share a common site of actions on the alpha subunit of the GABAA receptor.},

abstract = {Background: Previous studies have shown that propofol and sevoflurane enhance the function of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors. However, it is not known whether these two drugs modulate the same molecular pathways. in addition, little is known about receptor function in the presence of both propofol and sevoflurane. The aim of this study was to better understand the interactions of propofol and sevoflurane with the GABA(A) receptor.
Methods: Wild-type alpha(1), beta(2), gamma(2s) GABA(A) receptor subunit complementary DNAs were transfected into human embryonic kidney cells grown on glass coverslips using a calcium phosphate transfection method. After transfection (36-72 h), cells were whole cell patch clamped and exposed to combinations of the following: 0.3-1,000 mu m gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), 0-10 mu m propofol, and 0-1,650 mu m sevoflurane. Chemicals were delivered to the cells using two 10-channel infusion pumps and a rapid solution exchanger.
Results: Both propofol and sevoflurane alone enhanced the amplitude of GABAA receptor responses to submaximal concentrations of GABA in a dose-dependent manner. The enhancement was underpinned by an increase in the apparent affinity of the receptor for GABA. Coapplication of both anesthetics further enhanced the apparent affinity of the receptor for GABA.
Conclusions: Response surface modeling of the potentiation of GABA responses (0.3-1,000 pm) by sevoflurane and propofol revealed that the two anesthetics modulated receptor function in an additive manner. These results are consistent with recent mutagenesis studies, suggesting that these two drugs have separate binding sites and converging pathways of action on the GABAA receptor.},

abstract = {The gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor is the target of a structurally diverse group of sedative, hypnotic, and anesthetic drugs, including the volatile anesthetic isoflurane. Previous studies on the GABA(A) receptor have suggested the existence of a cavity located between transmembrane (TM) segments 2 and 3 in both alpha-1 and alpha-2 subunits, within which volatile anesthetics might bind. In this study, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to investigate the involvement of homologous residues of the GABA(A) alpha-3 subunit in allosteric modulation by isoflurane. Mutation of serine residue 294 within the TM2 to histidine or tyrosine increased the potency of GABA and decreased positive modulation by isoflurane. Mutation of alanine residue 315 within the TM3 to tryptophan increased the potency of GABA and abolished isoflurane modulation. The activity of the intravenous anesthetic propofol was unaltered from wild-type at these mutant receptors. These findings are consistent with the action of isoflurane on a critical site within the transmembrane domains of the receptor and suggest a degree of functional homology between the GABA(A) alpha-1, -2, and -3 subunits.},

To address this question, the authors studied the effects of isoflurane on a mutant GABA(A) receptor with a gating defect that decreases receptor sensitivity by lowering agonist efficacy. They then compared the effects of clinically relevant concentrations of isoflurane on the actions of GABA and piperidine-4-sulfonic acid (P4S), a partial agonist at the GABA(A) receptor.
Methods: The authors created a mutant of the GABA(A) receptor alpha(1) subunit (L277A) by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant subunit was coexpressed with beta(2) and gamma(2s) subunits in HEK293 cells, and responses to GABA and P4S were recorded using the whole cell patch clamp technique. EC50 values were determined for the full agonist GABA and the partial agonist P4S. The authors also determined the relative efficacy (epsilon) of P4S. These measurements were then repeated in the presence of isoflurane.
Results: The concentration-response curve for GABA was shifted to the right (EC50 = 278 muM) in the alpha(1)(L277A)beta(2)gamma(2S) mutant receptor, compared with the corresponding wild-type alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2S) GABA(A) receptor (EC50 = 16 muM). P4S is a partial agonist at both receptors, with a dramatically decreased relative efficacy at the mutant receptor (epsilon = 0.24). When the mutant receptor was studied in the presence of isoflurane, the concentration-response curves for both GABA and P4S were shifted to the left (EC50 for GABA = 78 muM); the efficacy of P4S also increased significantly (epsilon = 0.40).
Conclusion: By studying a mutant GABA(A) receptor with impaired gating, the authors were able to demonstrate clearly that isoflurane can increase the efficacy of a partial agonist, as well as increase agonist potency. These data suggest that the volatile anesthetic isoflurane exerts at least some of its effects on the GABA(A) receptor via alterations in gating rather than simply changing binding or unbinding of the agonist.},

Specific point mutations in the GABA(A) receptor selectively abolish regulation by benzodiazepines (Rudolph et al., 1999; McKernan et al., 2000) and by anesthetic ethers (Mihic et al., 1997; Krasowski et al., 1998; Koltchine et al., 1999), suggesting the existence of discrete binding sites on the GABA(A) receptor for these drugs. Using anesthetics of different molecular size (isoflurane {\textgreater} halothane {\textgreater} chloroform) together with complementary mutagenesis of specific amino acid side chains, we estimate the volume of a proposed anesthetic binding site as between 250 and 370 Angstrom (3). The results of the "cutoff" analysis suggest a common site of action for the anesthetics isoflurane, halothane, and chloroform on the GABA(A) receptor. Moreover, the data support a crucial role for Leu232, Ser270, and Ala291 in the alpha subunit in defining the boundaries of an amphipathic cavity, which can accommodate a variety of small general anesthetic molecules.},

Mutation of either or both subunits resulted in receptors that exhibited enhanced sensitivity to agonist and were spontaneously active in the absence of GABA. The spontaneous activity was blocked by picrotoxin or bicuculline. The enhancement of GABA-induced currents by pentobarbital, by the neurosteroid 5 alpha -pregnan-3 alpha -ol-20-one, and by the benzodiazepine flunitrazepam was dramatically reduced in the mutant receptors. These results are consistent with the idea that a mutation that promotes gating behavior in a ligand-gated ion channel will also show reduced effects of all positive allosteric modulators in a generalized manner, even when these modulators act at distinct sites on the receptor.

Recent work has revealed that two specific amino acid residues within transmembrane domain (TM)2 and TM3 are necessary for positive modulation of GABA(A) and glycine receptors by the volatile anesthetic enflurane. We now report that mutation of these residues within either GABA(A) alpha 2 (S270 or A291) or beta 1 (S265 or M286) subunits resulted in receptors that retain normal or near-normal gating by GABA but are insensitive to clinically relevant concentrations of another inhaled anesthetic, isoflurane. To determine whether receptor modulation by intravenous general anesthetics also was affected by these point mutations, we examined the effects of propofol, etomidate, the barbiturate methohexital, and the steroid alphaxalone on wild-type and mutant GABA(A) receptors expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. In most cases, these mutations had little or no effect on the actions of these intravenous anesthetics. However, a point mutation in the beta 1 subunit (M286W) abolished potentiation of GABA by propofol but did not alter direct activation of the receptor by high concentrations of propofol. These data indicate that the receptor structural requirements for positive modulation by volatile and intravenous general anesthetics may be quite distinct.},

abstract = {The $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA(A)R) is a target for general anesthetics of diverse chemical structures, which act as positive allosteric modulators at clinical doses. Previously, in a heterogeneous mixture of GABA(A)Rs purified from bovine brain, [³H]azietomidate photolabeling of $\alpha$Met-236 and $\beta$Met-286 in the $\alpha$M1 and $\beta$M3 transmembrane helices identified an etomidate binding site in the GABA(A)R transmembrane domain at the interface between the $\beta$ and $\alpha$ subunits [Li, G. D., et.al. (2006) J. Neurosci. 26, 11599-11605]. To further define GABA(A)R etomidate binding sites, we now use [³H]TDBzl-etomidate, an aryl diazirine with broader amino acid side chain reactivity than azietomidate, to photolabel purified human FLAG-$\alpha$1$\beta$3 GABA(A)Rs and more extensively identify photolabeled GABA(A)R amino acids. [³H]TDBzl-etomidate photolabeled in an etomidate-inhibitable manner $\beta$3Val-290, in the $\beta$3M3 transmembrane helix, as well as $\alpha$1Met-236 in $\alpha$1M1, a residue photolabeled by [³H]azietomidate, while no photolabeling of amino acids in the $\alpha$M2 and $\beta$M2 helices that also border the etomidate binding site was detected. The location of these photolabeled amino acids in GABA(A)R homology models derived from the recently determined structures of prokaryote (GLIC) or invertebrate (GluCl) homologues and the results of computational docking studies predict the orientation of [³H]TDBzl-etomidate bound in that site and the other amino acids contributing to this GABA(A)R intersubunit etomidate binding site. Etomidate-inhibitable photolabeling of $\beta$3Met-227 in $\beta$M1 by [³H]TDBzl-etomidate and [³H]azietomidate also provides evidence of a homologous etomidate binding site at the $\beta$3-$\beta$3 subunit interface in the $\alpha$1$\beta$3 GABA(A)R.},

Our Na(+) flux experiments confirmed that the second transmembrane domains (TM2) of alpha4 and beta2 in 2:3 stoichiometry, (alpha4)(2)(beta2)(3), could form pentameric channels, whereas the alpha4 TM2 alone could not. The structure, topology, and dynamics of the alpha4 TM2 and (alpha4)(2)(beta2)(3) TM2 in magnetically aligned phospholipid bicelles were investigated using solid-state NMR spectroscopy in the absence and presence of halothane and isoflurane, two clinically used volatile anesthetics. (2)H NMR demonstrated that anesthetics increased lipid conformational heterogeneity. Such anesthetic effects on lipids became more profound in the presence of transmembrane proteins. PISEMA experiments on the selectively (15)N-labeled alpha4 TM2 showed that the TM2 formed transmembrane helices with tilt angles of 12 degrees +/-1 degrees and 16 degrees +/-1 degrees relative to the bicelle normal for the alpha4 and (alpha4)(2)(beta2)(3) samples, respectively. Anesthetics changed the tilt angle of the alpha4 TM2 from 12 degrees +/-1 degrees to 14 degrees +/-1 degrees , but had only a subtle effect on the tilt angle of the (alpha4)(2)(beta2)(3) TM2. A small degree of wobbling motion of the helix axis occurred in the (alpha4)(2)(beta2)(3) TM2. In addition, a subset of the (alpha4)(2)(beta2)(3) TM2 exhibited counterclockwise rotational motion around the helix axis on a time scale slower than 10(-4) s in the presence of anesthetics. Both helical tilting and rotational motions have been identified computationally as critical elements for ion channel functions. This study suggested that anesthetics could alter these motions to modulate channel functions.},

Anesthetics inhibit the $\alpha$4$\beta$2 nAChR at clinically relevant concentrations, but their binding sites in $\alpha$4$\beta$2 remain unclear. The recently determined NMR structures of the $\alpha$4$\beta$2 nAChR transmembrane (TM) domains provide valuable frameworks for identifying the binding sites. In this study, we performed solution NMR experiments on the $\alpha$4$\beta$2 TM domains in the absence and presence of halothane and ketamine. Both anesthetics were found in an intra-subunit cavity near the extracellular end of the $\beta$2 transmembrane helices, homologous to a common anesthetic binding site observed in X-ray structures of anesthetic-bound GLIC (Nury et al., [32]). Halothane, but not ketamine, was also found in cavities adjacent to the common anesthetic site at the interface of $\alpha$4 and $\beta$2. In addition, both anesthetics bound to cavities near the ion selectivity filter at the intracellular end of the TM domains. Anesthetic binding induced profound changes in protein conformational exchanges. A number of residues, close to or remote from the binding sites, showed resonance signal splitting from single to double peaks, signifying that anesthetics decreased conformation exchange rates. It was also evident that anesthetics shifted population of two conformations. Altogether, the study comprehensively resolved anesthetic binding sites in the $\alpha$4$\beta$2 nAChR. Furthermore, the study provided compelling experimental evidence of anesthetic-induced changes in protein dynamics, especially near regions of the hydrophobic gate and ion selectivity filter that directly regulate channel functions.},

Potential causes underlying different functional responses to anesthetics remain elusive. Here we show that in contrast to the $\alpha$7 nAChR, the $\alpha$7$\beta$2 nAChR is highly susceptible to inhibition by the volatile anesthetic isoflurane in electrophysiology measurements. Isoflurane-binding sites in $\beta$2 and $\alpha$7 were found at the extracellular and intracellular end of their respective transmembrane domains using NMR. Functional relevance of the identified $\beta$2 site was validated via point mutations and subsequent functional measurements. Consistent with their functional responses to isoflurane, $\beta$2 but not $\alpha$7 showed pronounced dynamics changes, particularly for the channel gate residue Leu-249(9'). These results suggest that anesthetic binding alone is not sufficient to generate functional impact; only those sites that can modulate channel dynamics upon anesthetic binding will produce functional effects.},

To locate the sites of interaction of a long chain alcohol with the Torpedo nAChR, we have used the photoactivatible alcohol 3-[(3)H]azioctanol, which inhibits the nAChR and photoincorporates into nAChR subunits. At 1 and 275 microm, 3-[(3)H]azioctanol photoincorporated into nAChR subunits with increased incorporation in the alpha-subunit in the desensitized state. The incorporation into the alpha-subunit was mapped to two large proteolytic fragments. One fragment of approximately 20 kDa (alpha V8-20), containing the M1, M2, and M3 transmembrane segments, showed enhanced incorporation in the presence of agonist whereas the other of approximately 10 kDa (alpha V8-10), containing the M4 transmembrane segment, did not show agonist-induced incorporation of label. Within alpha V8-20, the primary site of incorporation was alpha Glu-262 at the C-terminal end of alpha M2, labeled preferentially in the desensitized state. The incorporation at alpha Glu-262 approached saturation between 1 microm, with approximately 6{\%} labeled, and 275 microm, with approximately 30{\%} labeled. Low level incorporation was seen in residues at the agonist binding site and the protein-lipid interface at approximately 1{\%} of the levels in alpha Glu-262. Therefore, the primary binding site of 3-azioctanol is within the ion channel with additional lower affinity interactions within the agonist binding site and at the protein-lipid interface.},

abstract = {Propofol, a widely used intravenous general anesthetic, acts at anesthetic concentrations as a positive allosteric modulator of $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid type A receptors and at higher concentration as an inhibitor of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Here, we characterize propofol binding sites in a muscle-type nAChR by use of a photoreactive analog of propofol, 2-isopropyl-5-[3-(trifluoromethyl)-3H-diazirin-3-yl]phenol (AziPm). Based upon radioligand binding assays, AziPm stabilized the Torpedo nAChR in the resting state, whereas propofol stabilized the desensitized state. nAChR-rich membranes were photolabeled with [(3)H]AziPm, and labeled amino acids were identified by Edman degradation. [(3)H]AziPm binds at three sites within the nAChR transmembrane domain: (i) an intrasubunit site in the $\delta$ subunit helix bundle, photolabeling in the nAChR desensitized state (+agonist) $\delta$M2-18' and two residues in $\delta$M1 ($\delta$Phe-232 and $\delta$Cys-236); (ii) in the ion channel, photolabeling in the nAChR resting, closed channel state (-agonist) amino acids in the M2 helices ($\alpha$M2-6', $\beta$M2-6' and -13', and $\delta$M2-13') that line the channel lumen (with photolabeling reduced by {\textgreater}90{\%} in the desensitized state); and (iii) at the $\gamma$-$\alpha$ interface, photolabeling $\alpha$M2-10'. Propofol enhanced [(3)H]AziPm photolabeling at $\alpha$M2-10'. Propofol inhibited [(3)H]AziPm photolabeling within the $\delta$ subunit helix bundle at lower concentrations (IC50 = 40 $\mu$m) than it inhibited ion channel photolabeling (IC50 = 125 $\mu$m). These results identify for the first time a single intrasubunit propofol binding site in the nAChR transmembrane domain and suggest that this is the functionally relevant inhibitory binding site.},

abstract = {The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is an important therapeutic target for a wide range of pathophysiological conditions, for which rational drug designs often require receptor structures at atomic resolution. Recent proof-of-concept studies demonstrated a water-solubilization approach to structure determination of membrane proteins by NMR (Slovic et al., PNAS, 101: 1828-1833, 2004; Ma et al., PNAS, 105: 16537-42, 2008). We report here the computational design and experimental characterization of WSA, a water-soluble protein with {\~{}}83{\%} sequence identity to the transmembrane (TM) domain of the nAChR $\alpha$1 subunit. Although the design was based on a low-resolution structural template, the resulting high-resolution NMR structure agrees remarkably well with the recent crystal structure of the TM domains of the bacterial Gloeobacter violaceus pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC), demonstrating the robustness and general applicability of the approach. NMR T(2) dispersion measurements showed that the TM2 domain of the designed protein was dynamic, undergoing conformational exchange on the NMR timescale. Photoaffinity labeling with isoflurane and propofol photolabels identified a common binding site in the immediate proximity of the anesthetic binding site found in the crystal structure of the anesthetic-GLIC complex. Our results illustrate the usefulness of high-resolution NMR analyses of water-solubilized channel proteins for the discovery of potential drug binding sites.},

abstract = {GABA type A receptors (GABAAR), the brain's major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors, are the targets for many general anesthetics, including volatile anesthetics, etomidate, propofol, and barbiturates. How such structurally diverse agents can act similarly as positive allosteric modulators of GABAARs remains unclear. Previously, photoreactive etomidate analogs identified two equivalent anesthetic-binding sites in the transmembrane domain at the $\beta$(+)-$\alpha$(-) subunit interfaces, which also contain the GABA-binding sites in the extracellular domain. Here, we used R-[(3)H]5-allyl-1-methyl-5-(m-trifluoromethyl-diazirynylphenyl) barbituric acid (R-mTFD-MPAB), a potent stereospecific barbiturate anesthetic, to photolabel expressed human $\alpha$1$\beta$3$\gamma$2 GABAARs. Protein microsequencing revealed that R-[(3)H]mTFD-MPAB did not photolabel the etomidate sites at the $\beta$(+)-$\alpha$(-) subunit interfaces. Instead, it photolabeled sites at the $\alpha$(+)-$\beta$(-) and $\gamma$(+)-$\beta$(-) subunit interfaces in the transmembrane domain. On the (+)-side, $\alpha$1M3 was labeled at Ala-291 and Tyr-294 and $\gamma$2M3 at Ser-301, and on the (-)-side, $\beta$3M1 was labeled at Met-227. These residues, like those in the etomidate site, are located at subunit interfaces near the synaptic side of the transmembrane domain. The selectivity of R-etomidate for the $\beta$(+)-$\alpha$(-) interface relative to the $\alpha$(+)-$\beta$(-)/$\gamma$(+)-$\beta$(-) interfaces was {\textgreater}100-fold, whereas that of R-mTFD-MPAB for its sites was {\textgreater}50-fold. Each ligand could enhance photoincorporation of the other, demonstrating allosteric interactions between the sites. The structural heterogeneity of barbiturate, etomidate, and propofol derivatives is accommodated by varying selectivities for these two classes of sites. We hypothesize that binding at any of these homologous intersubunit sites is sufficient for anesthetic action and that this explains to some degree the puzzling structural heterogeneity of anesthetics.},

abstract = {Some neurotransmitter-gated ion channels are very much more sensitive to general anesthetics than others, even when they are genetically and structurally related. The most striking example of this is the extreme sensitivity of heteromeric neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors to inhalational general anesthetics compared with the marked insensitivity of the closely related homomeric neuronal nicotinic receptors. Here we investigate the role of the alpha subunit in determining the anesthetic sensitivity of these receptors by using alpha(3)/alpha(7) chimeric subunits that are able to form functional homomeric receptors. By comparing the sensitivities of a number of chimeras to the inhalational agent halothane we show that the short (13 amino acids) putative extracellular loop connecting the second and third transmembrane segments is a critical determinant of anesthetic sensitivity. In addition, using site-directed mutagenesis, we show that two particular amino acids in this loop play a dominant role. When mutations are made in this loop, there is a good correlation between increasing anesthetic sensitivity and decreasing acetylcholine sensitivity. We conclude that this extracellular loop probably does not participate directly in anesthetic binding, but rather determines receptor sensitivity indirectly by playing a critical role in transducing anesthetic binding into an effect on channel gating.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed to investigate the partitioning of the volatile anesthetic halothane from an aqueous phase into a coexisting hydrated bilayer, composed of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) lipids, with embedded alpha-helical peptide bundles based on the membrane-bound portions of the alpha- and delta-subunits, respectively, of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. In the molecular dynamics simulations halothane molecules spontaneously partitioned into the DOPC bilayer and then preferentially occupied regions close to lipid headgroups. A single halothane molecule was observed to bind to tyrosine (Tyr-277) residue in the alpha-subunit, an experimentally identified specific binding site. The binding of halothane attenuated the local loop dynamics of alpha-subunit and significantly influenced global concerted motions suggesting anesthetic action in modulating protein function. Steered molecular dynamics calculations on a single halothane molecule partitioned into a DOPC lipid bilayer were performed to probe the free energy profile of halothane across the lipid-water interface and rationalize the observed spontaneous partitioning. Partitioned halothane molecules affect the hydrocarbon chains of the DOPC lipid, by lowering of the hydrocarbon tilt angles. The anesthetic molecules also caused a decrease in the number of peptide-lipid contacts. The observed local and global effects of anesthetic binding on protein motions demonstrated in this study may underlie the mechanism of action of anesthetics at a molecular level.},

abstract = {The molecular basis of anesthetic interaction with membrane proteins has been explored via determination of anesthetic effects on the structure and dynamics of the extended second transmembrane domain (TM2e) of the human neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) beta(2) subunit in dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles by (1)H and (15)N solution-state NMR. Both 1-chloro-1,2,2-trifluorocyclobutane (F3) and isoflurane, two volatile general anesthetics, induced nonuniform changes in chemical shifts among residues in TM2e. Saturation transfer difference NMR experiments further confirmed the direct anesthetic interaction with TM2e. A significant and more specific anesthetic interaction was observed on three leucine residues at the helix C-terminus. Although the TM2e helical structure remained after addition of anesthetics, plausible shortening and lengthening of helix hydrogen bonds were evidenced by periodic changes in backbone amide chemical shifts. The TM2e backbone dynamics were determined on the basis of the (15)N relaxation rate constants, R(1) and R(2), and the (15)N-[(1)H] NOE using the model-free approach. The global tumbling time (11.7 ns) of TM2e in micelles slightly increased ( approximately 12.3-12.5 ns) in the presence of anesthetics. The order parameter, S(2), exceeded 0.9 for all (15)N-labeled residues, showing a restricted internal motion. Anesthetics appear to have minor effect on the TM2e's internal motion. This study provided the basis for subsequent more comprehensive studies of anesthetic effects on the transmembrane domain complex of neuronal nAChR.},

abstract = {Despite the widespread clinical use of anesthetics since the 19th century, a clear understanding of the mechanism of anesthetic action has yet to emerge. On the basis of early experiments by Meyer, Overton, and subsequent researchers, the cell's lipid membrane was generally concluded to be the primary site of action of anesthetics. However, later experiments with lipid-free globular proteins, such as luciferase and apoferritin, shifted the focus of anesthetic action to proteins. Recent experimental studies, such as photoaffinity labeling and mutagenesis on membrane proteins, have suggested specific binding sites for anesthetic molecules, further strengthening the proteocentric view of anesthetic mechanism. With the increased availability of high-resolution crystal structures of ion channels and other integral membrane proteins, as well as the availability of powerful computers, the structure-function relationship of anesthetic-protein interactions can now be investigated in atomic detail. In this Account, we review recent experiments and related computer simulation studies involving interactions of inhalational anesthetics and proteins, with a particular focus on membrane proteins. Globular proteins have long been used as models for understanding the role of protein-anesthetic interactions and are accordingly examined in this Account. Using selected examples of membrane proteins, such as nicotinic acetyl choline receptor (nAChR) and potassium channels, we address the issues of anesthetic binding pockets in proteins, the role of conformation in anesthetic effects, and the modulation of local as well as global dynamics of proteins by inhaled anesthetics. In the case of nicotinic receptors, inhalational anesthetic halothane binds to the hydrophobic cavity close to the M2-M3 loop. This binding modulates the dynamics of the M2-M3 loop, which is implicated in allosterically transmitting the effects to the channel gate, thus altering the function of the protein. In potassium channels, anesthetic molecules preferentially potentiate the open conformation by quenching the motion of the aromatic residues implicated in the gating of the channel. These simulations suggest that low-affinity drugs (such as inhalational anesthetics) modulate the protein function by influencing local as well as global dynamics of proteins. Because of intrinsic experimental limitations, computational approaches represent an important avenue for exploring the mode of action of anesthetics. Molecular dynamics simulations-a computational technique frequently used in the general study of proteins-offer particular insight in the study of the interaction of inhalational anesthetics with membrane proteins.},

abstract = {Enhancement of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA(A)R)-mediated inhibition is a property of most general anesthetics and a candidate for a molecular mechanism of anesthesia. Intravenous anesthetics, including etomidate, propofol, barbiturates, and neuroactive steroids, as well as volatile anesthetics and long-chain alcohols, all enhance GABA(A)R function at anesthetic concentrations. The implied existence of a receptor site for anesthetics on the GABA(A)R protein was supported by identification, using photoaffinity labeling, of a binding site for etomidate within the GABA(A)R transmembrane domain at the beta-alpha subunit interface; the etomidate analog [(3)H]azietomidate photolabeled in a pharmacologically specific manner two amino acids, alpha1Met-236 in the M1 helix and betaMet-286 in the M3 helix (Li, G. D., Chiara, D. C., Sawyer, G. W., Husain, S. S., Olsen, R. W., and Cohen, J. B. (2006) J. Neurosci. 26, 11599-11605). Here, we use [(3)H]azietomidate photolabeling of bovine brain GABA(A)Rs to determine whether other structural classes of anesthetics interact with the etomidate binding site. Photolabeling was inhibited by anesthetic concentrations of propofol, barbiturates, and the volatile agent isoflurane, at low millimolar concentrations, but not by octanol or ethanol. Inhibition by barbiturates, which was pharmacologically specific and stereospecific, and by propofol was only partial, consistent with allosteric interactions, whereas isoflurane inhibition was nearly complete, apparently competitive. Protein sequencing showed that propofol inhibited to the same extent the photolabeling of alpha1Met-236 and betaMet-286. These results indicate that several classes of general anesthetics modulate etomidate binding to the GABA(A)R: isoflurane binds directly to the site with millimolar affinity, whereas propofol and barbiturates inhibit binding but do not bind in a mutually exclusive manner with etomidate.},

abstract = {Despite the widespread clinical use of anesthetics since the 19th century, a clear understanding of the mechanism of anesthetic action has yet to emerge. On the basis of early experiments by Meyer, Overton, and subsequent researchers, the cell's lipid membrane was generally concluded to be the primary site of action of anesthetics. However, later experiments with lipid-free globular proteins, such as luciferase and apoferritin, shifted the focus of anesthetic action to proteins. Recent experimental studies, such as photoaffinity labeling and mutagenesis on membrane proteins, have suggested specific binding sites for anesthetic molecules, further strengthening the proteocentric view of anesthetic mechanism. With the increased availability of high-resolution crystal structures of ion channels and other integral membrane proteins, as well as the availability of powerful computers, the structure-function relationship of anesthetic-protein interactions can now be investigated in atomic detail. In this Account, we review recent experiments and related computer simulation studies involving interactions of inhalational anesthetics and proteins, with a particular focus on membrane proteins. Globular proteins have long been used as models for understanding the role of protein-anesthetic interactions and are accordingly examined in this Account. Using selected examples of membrane proteins, such as nicotinic acetyl choline receptor (nAChR) and potassium channels, we address the issues of anesthetic binding pockets in proteins, the role of conformation in anesthetic effects, and the modulation of local as well as global dynamics of proteins by inhaled anesthetics. In the case of nicotinic receptors, inhalational anesthetic halothane binds to the hydrophobic cavity close to the M2-M3 loop. This binding modulates the dynamics of the M2-M3 loop, which is implicated in allosterically transmitting the effects to the channel gate, thus altering the function of the protein. In potassium channels, anesthetic molecules preferentially potentiate the open conformation by quenching the motion of the aromatic residues implicated in the gating of the channel. These simulations suggest that low-affinity drugs (such as inhalational anesthetics) modulate the protein function by influencing local as well as global dynamics of proteins. Because of intrinsic experimental limitations, computational approaches represent an important avenue for exploring the mode of action of anesthetics. Molecular dynamics simulations-a computational technique frequently used in the general study of proteins-offer particular insight in the study of the interaction of inhalational anesthetics with membrane proteins.},

abstract = {General anesthetics, including etomidate, act by binding to and enhancing the function of GABA type A receptors (GABA(A)Rs), which mediate inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain. Here, we used a radiolabeled, photoreactive etomidate analog ([(3)H]azietomidate), which retains anesthetic potency in vivo and enhances GABA(A)R function in vitro, to identify directly, for the first time, amino acids that contribute to a GABA(A)R anesthetic binding site. For GABA(A)Rs purified by affinity chromatography from detergent extracts of bovine cortex, [(3)H]azietomidate photoincorporation was increased by GABA and inhibited by etomidate in a concentration-dependent manner (IC(50) = 30 microm). Protein microsequencing of fragments isolated from proteolytic digests established photolabeling of two residues: one within the alphaM1 transmembrane helix at alpha1Met-236 (and/or the homologous methionines in alpha2,3,5), not previously implicated in etomidate function, and one within the betaM3 transmembrane helix at beta3Met-286 (and/or the homologous methionines in beta1,2), an etomidate sensitivity determinant. The pharmacological specificity of labeling indicates that these methionines contribute to a single binding pocket for etomidate located in the transmembrane domain at the interface between beta and alpha subunits, in what is predicted by structural models based on homology with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor to be a water-filled pocket approximately 50 A below the GABA binding site. The localization of the etomidate binding site to an intersubunit, not an intrasubunit, binding pocket is a novel conclusion that suggests more generally that the localization of drug binding sites to subunit interfaces may be a feature not only for GABA and benzodiazepines but also for etomidate and other intravenous and volatile anesthetics.},

abstract = {The {\{}gamma{\}}-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor is a transmitter-gated ion channel mediating the majority of fast inhibitory synaptic transmission within the brain. The receptor is a pentameric assembly of subunits drawn from multiple classes (1-6, {\{}beta{\}}1-3, {\{}gamma{\}}1-3, {\{}delta{\}}1, and {\{}varepsilon{\}}1). Positive allosteric modulation of GABAA receptor activity by general anesthetics represents one logical mechanism for central nervous system depression. The ability of the intravenous general anesthetic etomidate to modulate and activate GABAA receptors is uniquely dependent upon the {\{}beta{\}} subunit subtype present within the receptor. Receptors containing {\{}beta{\}}2- or {\{}beta{\}}3-, but not {\{}beta{\}}1 subunits, are highly sensitive to the agent. Here, chimeric {\{}beta{\}}1/{\{}beta{\}}2 subunits coexpressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes with human 6 and {\{}gamma{\}}2 subunits identified a region distal to the extracellular N-terminal domain as a determinant of the selectivity of etomidate. The mutation of an amino acid (Asn-289) present within the channel domain of the {\{}beta{\}}3 subunit to Ser (the homologous residue in {\{}beta{\}}1), strongly suppressed the GABA-modulatory and GABA-mimetic effects of etomidate. The replacement of the {\{}beta{\}}1 subunit Ser-290 by Asn produced the converse effect. When applied intracellularly to mouse L(tk-) cells stably expressing the 6{\{}beta{\}}3{\{}gamma{\}}2 subunit combination, etomidate was inert. Hence, the effects of a clinically utilized general anesthetic upon a physiologically relevant target protein are dramatically influenced by a single amino acid. Together with the lack of effect of intracellular etomidate, the data argue against a unitary, lipid-based theory of anesthesia.},

abstract = {Type A gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors of the mammalian nervous system are a family of ligand-gated ion channels probably formed from the coassembly of different subunits (alpha 1-6, beta 1-3, gamma 1-3, delta) in the arrangement alpha beta gamma or alpha beta delta. The activation of these receptors by GABA can be modulated by a range of compounds acting at distinct allosteric sites. One such compound is the broad-spectrum anticonvulsant loreclezole, which we have recently shown to act via a specific modulatory site on the beta subunit of the GABAA receptor. The action of loreclezole depends on the type of beta subunit present in the receptor complex; receptors containing beta 2 or beta 3 subunits have {\textgreater} 300-fold higher affinity for loreclezole than receptors containing a beta 1 subunit. We have used this property to identify the amino acid residue in the beta subunit that determines the subunit selectivity of loreclezole. Chimeric beta 1/beta 2 human GABAA receptor subunits were constructed and coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes with human alpha 1 and gamma 2s subunits. The chimera beta 1/beta 2Lys237-Gly334 conferred sensitivity to 1 microM loreclezole. Within this region there are four amino acids that are conserved in beta 2 and beta 3 but differ in beta 1. By mutating single amino acids of the beta 1 subunit to the beta 2/beta 3 equivalent, only the beta 1 mutation of Ser-290--{\textgreater}Asn conferred potentiation by loreclezole. Similarly, mutation of the homologous residue in the beta 2 and beta 3 subunits to the beta 1 equivalent (Asn--{\textgreater}Ser) resulted in loss of sensitivity to loreclezole. The affinity for GABA and the potentiation by flunitrazepam were unchanged in receptors containing the mutated beta subunits. Thus, a single amino acid, beta 2 Asn-289 (beta 3 Asn-290), located at the carboxyl-terminal end of the putative channel-lining domain TM2, confers sensitivity to the modulatory effects of loreclezole.},

@article{Olsen2011,
abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge of detailed biochemical evidence for the role of $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA(A)-Rs) in the mechanisms of general anesthesia.

PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: With the knowledge that all general anesthetics positively modulate GABA(A)-R-mediated inhibitory transmission, site-directed mutagenesis comparing sequences of GABA(A)-R subunits of varying sensitivity led to identification of amino acid residues in the transmembrane domain that are critical for the drug actions in vitro. Using a photo incorporable analogue of the general anesthetic, R(+)etomidate, we identified two transmembrane amino acids that were affinity labelled in purified bovine brain GABA(A)-R. Homology protein structural modelling positions these two residues, $\alpha$M1-11' and $\beta$M3-4', close to each other in a single type of intersubunit etomidate binding pocket at the $\beta$/$\alpha$ interface. This position would be appropriate for modulation of agonist channel gating. Overall, available information suggests that these two etomidate binding residues are allosterically coupled to sites of action of steroids, barbiturates, volatile agents, and propofol, but not alcohols. Residue $\alpha$/$\beta$M2-15' is probably not a binding site but allosterically coupled to action of volatile agents, alcohols, and intravenous agents, and $\alpha$/$\beta$M1-(-2') is coupled to action of intravenous agents.

CONCLUSIONS: Establishment of a coherent and consistent structural model of the GABA(A)-R lends support to the conclusion that general anesthetics can modulate function by binding to appropriate domains on the protein. Genetic engineering of mice with mutation in some of these GABA(A)-R residues are insensitive to general anesthetics in vivo, suggesting that further analysis of these domains could lead to development of more potent and specific drugs.},

abstract = {Enhancement of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA(A)R)-mediated inhibition is a property of most general anesthetics and a candidate for a molecular mechanism of anesthesia. Intravenous anesthetics, including etomidate, propofol, barbiturates, and neuroactive steroids, as well as volatile anesthetics and long-chain alcohols, all enhance GABA(A)R function at anesthetic concentrations. The implied existence of a receptor site for anesthetics on the GABA(A)R protein was supported by identification, using photoaffinity labeling, of a binding site for etomidate within the GABA(A)R transmembrane domain at the beta-alpha subunit interface; the etomidate analog [(3)H]azietomidate photolabeled in a pharmacologically specific manner two amino acids, alpha1Met-236 in the M1 helix and betaMet-286 in the M3 helix (Li, G. D., Chiara, D. C., Sawyer, G. W., Husain, S. S., Olsen, R. W., and Cohen, J. B. (2006) J. Neurosci. 26, 11599-11605). Here, we use [(3)H]azietomidate photolabeling of bovine brain GABA(A)Rs to determine whether other structural classes of anesthetics interact with the etomidate binding site. Photolabeling was inhibited by anesthetic concentrations of propofol, barbiturates, and the volatile agent isoflurane, at low millimolar concentrations, but not by octanol or ethanol. Inhibition by barbiturates, which was pharmacologically specific and stereospecific, and by propofol was only partial, consistent with allosteric interactions, whereas isoflurane inhibition was nearly complete, apparently competitive. Protein sequencing showed that propofol inhibited to the same extent the photolabeling of alpha1Met-236 and betaMet-286. These results indicate that several classes of general anesthetics modulate etomidate binding to the GABA(A)R: isoflurane binds directly to the site with millimolar affinity, whereas propofol and barbiturates inhibit binding but do not bind in a mutually exclusive manner with etomidate.},

abstract = {Photoaffinity labeling of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A))-receptors (GABA(A)R) with an etomidate analog and mutational analyses of direct activation of GABA(A)R by neurosteroids have each led to the proposal that these structurally distinct general anesthetics bind to sites in GABA(A)Rs in the transmembrane domain at the interface between the beta and alpha subunits. We tested whether the two ligand binding sites might overlap by examining whether neuroactive steroids inhibited etomidate analog photolabeling. We previously identified (Li, G. D., Chiara, D. C., Sawyer, G. W., Husain, S. S., Olsen, R. W., and Cohen, J. B. (2006) J. Neurosci. 26, 11599-11605) azietomidate photolabeling of GABA(A)R alpha1Met-236 and betaMet-286 (in alphaM1 and betaM3). Positioning these two photolabeled amino acids in a single type of binding site at the interface of beta and alpha subunits (two copies per pentamer) is consistent with a GABA(A)R homology model based upon the structure of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and with recent alphaM1 to betaM3 cross-linking data. Biologically active neurosteroids enhance rather than inhibit azietomidate photolabeling, as assayed at the level of GABA(A)R subunits on analytical SDS-PAGE, and protein microsequencing establishes that the GABA(A)R-modulating neurosteroids do not inhibit photolabeling of GABA(A)R alpha1Met-236 or betaMet-286 but enhance labeling of alpha1Met-236. Thus modulatory steroids do not bind at the same site as etomidate, and neither of the amino acids identified as neurosteroid activation determinants (Hosie, A. M., Wilkins, M. E., da Silva, H. M., and Smart, T. G. (2006) Nature 444, 486-489) are located at the subunit interface defined by our etomidate site model.},

Here we describe high resolution crystal structures of HSA with two of the most widely used general anesthetics, propofol and halothane. In addition, we describe a crystal structure of HSA complexed with both halothane and the fatty acid, myristate. We show that the intravenous anesthetic propofol binds at two discrete sites on HSA in preformed pockets that have been shown to accommodate fatty acids. Similarly we show that the inhalational agent halothane binds (at concentrations in the pharmacologically relevant range) at three sites that are also fatty acid binding loci. At much higher halothane concentrations, we have identified additional sites that are occupied. All of the higher affinity anesthetic binding sites are amphiphilic in nature, with both polar and apolar parts, and anesthetic binding causes only minor changes in local structure.},

abstract = {The X-ray structure of a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel from Erwinia chrysanthemi (ELIC) has recently provided structural insight into this family of ion channels at high resolution. The structure shows a homo-pentameric protein with a barrel-stave architecture that defines an ion-conduction pore located on the fivefold axis of symmetry. In this structure, the wide aqueous vestibule that is encircled by the extracellular ligand-binding domains of the five subunits narrows to a discontinuous pore that spans the lipid bilayer. The pore is constricted by bulky hydrophobic residues towards the extracellular side, which probably serve as barriers that prevent the diffusion of ions. This interrupted pore architecture in ELIC thus depicts a non-conducting conformation of a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel, the thermodynamically stable state in the absence of bound ligand. As ligand binding promotes pore opening in these ion channels and the specific ligand for ELIC has not yet been identified, we have turned our attention towards a homologous protein from the cyanobacterium Gloebacter violaceus (GLIC). GLIC was shown to form proton-gated channels that are activated by a pH decrease on the extracellular side and that do not desensitize after activation. Both prokaryotic proteins, ELIC and GLIC form ion channels that are selective for cations over anions with poor discrimination among monovalent cations, characteristics that resemble the conduction properties of the cation-selective branch of the family that includes acetylcholine and serotonin receptors. Here we present the X-ray structure of GLIC at 3.1 A resolution. The structure reveals a conformation of the channel that is distinct from ELIC and that probably resembles the open state. In combination, both structures suggest a novel gating mechanism for pentameric ligand-gated ion channels where channel opening proceeds by a change in the tilt of the pore-forming helices.},

abstract = {Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) are targets of general anesthetics, but a structural understanding of anesthetic action on pLGICs remains elusive. GLIC, a prokaryotic pLGIC, can be inhibited by anesthetics, including ketamine. The ketamine concentration leading to half-maximal inhibition of GLIC (58 $\mu$M) is comparable to that on neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. A 2.99 {\AA} resolution X-ray structure of GLIC bound with ketamine revealed ketamine binding to an intersubunit cavity that partially overlaps with the homologous antagonist-binding site in pLGICs. The functional relevance of the identified ketamine site was highlighted by profound changes in GLIC activation upon cysteine substitution of the cavity-lining residue N152. The relevance is also evidenced by changes in ketamine inhibition upon the subsequent chemical labeling of N152C. The results provide structural insight into the molecular recognition of ketamine and are valuable for understanding the actions of anesthetics and other allosteric modulators on pLGICs.},

Here, we report the x-ray crystal structure of the Erwinia chrysanthemi ligand-gated ion channel (ELIC) in complex with a derivative of chloroform, which reveals important features of anesthetic recognition, involving multiple binding at three different sites. One site is located in the channel pore and equates with a noncompetitive inhibitor site found in many pLGICs. A second transmembrane site is novel and is located in the lower part of the transmembrane domain, at an interface formed between adjacent subunits. A third site is also novel and is located in the extracellular domain in a hydrophobic pocket between the $\beta$7-$\beta$10 strands. Together, these results extend our understanding of pLGIC modulation and reveal several specific binding interactions that may contribute to modulator recognition, further substantiating a multisite model of allosteric modulation in this family of ion channels.},

abstract = {Propofol is the most widely used injectable general anesthetic. Its targets include ligand-gated ion channels such as the GABA(A) receptor, but such receptor-channel complexes remain challenging to study at atomic resolution. Until structural biology methods advance to the point of being able to deal with systems such as the GABA(A) receptor, it will be necessary to use more tractable surrogates to probe the molecular details of anesthetic recognition. We have previously shown that recognition of inhalational general anesthetics by the model protein apoferritin closely mirrors recognition by more complex and clinically relevant protein targets; here we show that apoferritin also binds propofol and related GABAergic anesthetics, and that the same binding site mediates recognition of both inhalational and injectable anesthetics. Apoferritin binding affinities for a series of propofol analogs were found to be strongly correlated with the ability to potentiate GABA responses at GABA(A) receptors, validating this model system for injectable anesthetics. High resolution x-ray crystal structures reveal that, despite the presence of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, anesthetic recognition is mediated largely by van der Waals forces and the hydrophobic effect. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the ligands undergo considerable fluctuations about their equilibrium positions. Finally, apoferritin displays both structural and dynamic responses to anesthetic binding, which may mimic changes elicited by anesthetics in physiologic targets like ion channels.},

abstract = {Physiologic sites for inhaled anesthetics are presumed to be cavities within transmembrane 4-alpha-helix bundles of neurotransmitter receptors, but confirmation of binding and structural detail of such sites remains elusive. To provide such detail, we screened soluble proteins containing this structural motif, and found only one that exhibited evidence of strong anesthetic binding. Ferritin is a 24-mer of 4-alpha-helix bundles; both halothane and isoflurane bind with K(A) values of approximately 10(5) M(-1), higher than any previously reported inhaled anesthetic-protein interaction. The crystal structures of the halothane/apoferritin and isoflurane/apoferritin complexes were determined at 1.75 A resolution, revealing a common anesthetic binding pocket within an interhelical dimerization interface. The high affinity is explained by several weak polar contacts and an optimal host/guest packing relationship. Neither the acidic protons nor ether oxygen of the anesthetics contribute to the binding interaction. Compared with unliganded apoferritin, the anesthetic produced no detectable alteration of structure or B factors. The remarkably high affinity of the anesthetic/apoferritin complex implies greater selectivity of protein sites than previously thought, and suggests that direct protein actions may underlie effects at lower than surgical levels of anesthetic, including loss of awareness.},

It binds a diverse range of general anesthetics over a large potency range, displays a sensitivity to anesthetics that is very similar to that found in animals, and has an anesthetic sensitivity that can be modulated by one of its substrates (ATP). In this paper we describe the properties of bromoform acting as a general anesthetic (in Rana temporaria tadpoles) and as an inhibitor of the firefly luciferase enzyme at high and low ATP concentrations. In addition, we describe the crystal structure of the low-ATP form of the luciferase enzyme in the presence of bromoform at 2.2-A resolution. These results provide a structural basis for understanding the anesthetic inhibition of the enzyme, as well as an explanation for the ATP modulation of its anesthetic sensitivity.},

@article{Xu2000a,
abstract = {New lines of evidence suggest that volatile anesthetics interact specifically with proteins. Direct binding analysis, however, has been largely limited to soluble proteins. In this study, specific interaction was investigated between isoflurane, a clinically important volatile anesthetic, and membrane-bound nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) from Torpedo electroplax, using (19)F nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gas chromatography. The receptors were reconstituted into 1, 2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) lipid vesicles. After correcting for nonspecific partitioning into the lipid, the equilibrium dissociation constant, K(d), of isoflurane binding to nAChR at 15 degrees C was found to be 0.36 +/- 0.03 mM. This value is within the clinically relevant concentration range of the agent. Based on the receptor concentrations in the vesicle suspension assayed by the bicinchoninic acid method and the fraction of bound isoflurane, X(b), determined by gas chromatography, an estimate of an average of 9-10 specifically bound isoflurane molecules can be made for each receptor, or two for each subunit. Upon binding, the transverse relaxation time constant (T(2)) of (19)F resonance of isoflurane is decreased by nearly three orders of magnitude, indicating a dramatic reduction in the mobility of specifically bound isoflurane. Kinetic analysis reveals that the off rate of binding, k(-1), is 1.7 x 10(4) s(-1). The on rate, k(+1), can thus be calculated to be approximately 4.8 x 10(7) M(-1) s(-1), suggesting a nearly diffusion-limited association. This is in contrast to anesthetic binding to a soluble protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA), where k(+1) and k(-1) are at least an order of magnitude slower. It is concluded that the presence of lipids may be critical for the correct evaluation of binding kinetics between volatile anesthetics and neuronal receptors.},

Isoflurane introduced into the aqueous phase readily partitions into the lipid membrane and the membrane-bound protein. Specifically, isoflurane binds persistently to three classes of sites in the nAChR transmembrane domain: (i) An isoflurane dimer occludes the pore, contacting residues identified by previous mutagenesis studies; analogous behavior is observed in GLIC. (ii) Several nAChR subunit interfaces are also occupied, in a site suggested by photoaffinity labeling and thought to positively modulate the receptor; these sites are not occupied in GLIC. (iii) Isoflurane binds to the subunit centers of both nAChR alpha chains and one of the GLIC chains, in a site that has had little experimental targeting. Interpreted in the context of existing structural and physiological data, the present MD results support a multisite model for the mechanism of receptor-channel modulation by anesthetics.},

abstract = {General anaesthetics have enjoyed long and widespread use but their molecular mechanism of action remains poorly understood. There is good evidence that their principal targets are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) such as inhibitory GABA(A) ($\gamma$-aminobutyric acid) receptors and excitatory nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which are respectively potentiated and inhibited by general anaesthetics. The bacterial homologue from Gloeobacter violaceus (GLIC), whose X-ray structure was recently solved, is also sensitive to clinical concentrations of general anaesthetics. Here we describe the crystal structures of the complexes propofol/GLIC and desflurane/GLIC. These reveal a common general-anaesthetic binding site, which pre-exists in the apo-structure in the upper part of the transmembrane domain of each protomer. Both molecules establish van der Waals interactions with the protein; propofol binds at the entrance of the cavity whereas the smaller, more flexible, desflurane binds deeper inside. Mutations of some amino acids lining the binding site profoundly alter the ionic response of GLIC to protons, and affect its general-anaesthetic pharmacology. Molecular dynamics simulations, performed on the wild type (WT) and two GLIC mutants, highlight differences in mobility of propofol in its binding site and help to explain these effects. These data provide a novel structural framework for the design of general anaesthetics and of allosteric modulators of brain pLGICs.},

abstract = {Although general anesthetics are known to modulate the activity of ligand-gated ion channels in the Cys-loop superfamily, there is at present neither consensus on the underlying mechanisms, nor predictive models of this modulation. Viable models need to offer quantitative assessment of the relative importance of several identified anesthetic binding sites. However, to date, precise affinity data for individual sites has been challenging to obtain by biophysical means. Here, the likely role of pore block inhibition by the general anesthetics isoflurane and propofol of the prokaryotic pentameric channel GLIC is investigated by molecular simulations. Microscopic affinities are calculated for both single and double occupancy binding of isoflurane and propofol to the GLIC pore. Computations are carried out for an open-pore conformation in which the pore is restrained to crystallographic radius, and a closed-pore conformation that results from unrestrained molecular dynamics equilibration of the structure. The GLIC pore is predicted to be blocked at the micromolar concentrations for which inhibition by isofluorane and propofol is observed experimentally. Calculated affinities suggest that pore block by propofol occurs at signifcantly lower concentrations than those for which inhibition is observed: we argue that this discrepancy may result from binding of propofol to an allosteric site recently identified by X-ray crystallography, which may cause a competing gain-of-function effect. Affinities of isoflurane and propofol to the allosteric site are also calculated, and shown to be 3 mM for isoflurane and 10 $\mu$M for propofol; both anesthetics have a lower affinity for the allosteric site than for the unoccupied pore.},

abstract = {The recent crystal structure of Orai, the pore unit of a calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channel, is used as the starting point for molecular dynamics and free-energy calculations designed to probe this channel's conduction properties. In free molecular dynamics simulations, cations localize preferentially at the extracellular channel entrance near the ring of Glu residues identified in the crystal structure, whereas anions localize in the basic intracellular half of the pore. To begin to understand ion permeation, the potential of mean force (PMF) was calculated for displacing a single Na(+) ion along the pore of the CRAC channel. The computed PMF indicates that the central hydrophobic region provides the major hindrance for ion diffusion along the permeation pathway, thereby illustrating the nonconducting nature of the crystal structure conformation. Strikingly, further PMF calculations demonstrate that the mutation V174A decreases the free energy barrier for conduction, rendering the channel effectively open. This seemingly dramatic effect of mutating a nonpolar residue for a smaller nonpolar residue in the pore hydrophobic region suggests an important role for the latter in conduction. Indeed, our computations show that even without significant channel-gating motions, a subtle change in the number of pore waters is sufficient to reshape the local electrostatic field and modulate the energetics of conduction, a result that rationalizes recent experimental findings. The present work suggests the activation mechanism for the wild-type CRAC channel is likely regulated by the number of pore waters and hence pore hydration governs the conductance.},

abstract = {General anesthetics are essential to modern medicine, and yet a detailed understanding of their mechanisms of action is lacking. General anesthetics were once believed to be "drugs without receptors" but this view has been largely abandoned. During the past decade significant progress in our understanding of the mechanisms of general anesthetic action at the molecular, cellular and neural systems levels has been made. Different molecular targets in various regions of the nervous system are involved in the multiple components of anesthetic action, and these targets can vary between specific anesthetics. Neurotransmitter-gated ion channels, particularly receptors for GABA and glutamate, are modulated by most anesthetics, at both synaptic and extrasynaptic sites, and additional ion channels and receptors are also being recognized as important targets for general anesthetics. In this article, these developments, which have important implications for the development of more-selective anesthetics, are reviewed in the context of recent advances in ion channel structure and function.},

Biochemical and molecular biological studies indicate that considerable receptor heterogeneity exists, but physiological differences between inhibitory GABAA synaptic responses have not been identified in the brain. The present report describes two anatomically segregated GABAA-mediated synaptic currents in the hippocampal CA1 region that have distinct physiological, pharmacological, and functional properties. GABAA,fast enters at or near the cell body, decays rapidly (3-8 ms), is blocked by furosemide, and rapidly curtails the excitatory response. GABAA,slow enters far from the cell body, decays slowly (30-70 ms), is not blocked by furosemide, and underlies the conventionally recognized early inhibitory postsynaptic potential. The receptors producing these responses may represent subtypes of the GABAA receptor.},

abstract = {Many anesthetics, including the volatile agent halothane, prolong the decay of GABA(A) receptor-mediated IPSCs at central synapses. This effect is thought to be a major factor in the production of anesthesia. A variety of different kinetic mechanisms have been proposed for several intravenous agents, but for volatile agents the kinetic mechanisms underlying this change remain unknown. To address this question, we used rapid solution exchange techniques to apply GABA to recombinant GABA(A) receptors (alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2s)) expressed in HEK 293 cells, in the absence and presence of halothane. To differentiate between different microscopic kinetic steps that may be altered by the anesthetic, we studied a variety of measures, including peak concentration-response characteristics, macroscopic desensitization, recovery from desensitization, maximal current activation rates, and responses to the low-affinity agonist taurine. Experimentally observed alterations were compared with predictions based on a kinetic scheme that incorporated two agonist binding steps, and open and desensitized states. We found that, in addition to slowing deactivation after a brief pulse of GABA, halothane increased agonist sensitivity and slowed recovery from desensitization but did not alter macroscopic desensitization or maximal activation rate and only slightly slowed rapid deactivation after taurine application. This pattern of responses was found to be consistent with a reduction in the microscopic agonist unbinding rate (k(off)) but not with changes in channel gating steps, such as the channel opening rate (beta), closing rate (alpha), or microscopic desensitization. We conclude that halothane slows IPSC decay by slowing dissociation of agonist from the receptor.},

abstract = {General anaesthetics cause sedation, amnesia and hypnosis. Although these clinically desired actions are indicative of an impairment of neocortical information processing, it is widely held that they are to a large part mediated by subcortical neural networks. Anaesthetic action on brain stem, basal forebrain and thalamus, all of which are known to modulate cortical excitability, would thus ultimately converge on neocortex, perturbing and reducing action potential activity therein. However, as neocortex harbours molecular targets of anaesthetics in high densities, notably GABA(A) receptors, neocortex itself should be very sensitive to anaesthetics. Here, we performed experiments to reveal the extent to which neocortex proper is a relevant target of the low concentrations of volatile anaesthetics causing sedation and hypnosis. We compared the effects of isoflurane, enflurane and halothane on spontaneous action potential activity of rat neocortical neurons in vivo and in isolated cortical networks in vitro, i.e. in the presence and absence of subcortical arousal systems. We observed that the anaesthetics decreased spontaneous firing of neurons via intracortical mechanisms; concentrations inducing hypnosis in humans reduced discharge rates both in vivo and in vitro to the same extent, approximately 50{\%}. This decrease in neuronal activity was paralleled by a significant enhancement of neocortical GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibition. These findings challenge the notion of predominantly subcortical effects of volatile anaesthetics and suggest that intracortical targets, among them neocortical GABA(A) receptors, mediate the sedative and hypnotic properties of volatile anaesthetics.},

The inhibitory strychnine-sensitive glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors are positively modulated by anesthetics and alcohols, and site-directed mutagenesis techniques have identified amino acid residues important for the action of volatile anesthetics and alcohols in these receptors. A key question is whether these amino acids are part of an alcohol/anesthetic-binding site. In the present study, we used an alkanethiol anesthetic to covalently label its binding site by mutating selected amino acids to cysteine. We demonstrated that the anesthetic propanethiol, or alternatively, propyl methanethiosulfonate, covalently binds to cysteine residues introduced into a specific second transmembrane site in glycine receptor and gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor subunits and irreversibly enhances receptor function. Moreover, upon permanent occupation of the site by propyl disulfide, the usual ability of octanol, enflurane, and isoflurane to potentiate the function of the ion channels was lost. This approach provides strong evidence that the actions of anesthetics in these receptors are due to binding at a single site.},

As a result of research during the past several decades, a group of ligand-gated ion channels have emerged as plausible targets for general anesthetics. Molecular biology techniques have greatly accelerated attempts to classify ligand-gated ion channel sensitivity to general anesthetics, and have identified the sites of receptor subunits critical for anesthetic modulation using chimeric and mutated receptors. The experimental data have facilitated the construction of tenable molecular models for anesthetic binding sites, which in turn allows structural predictions to be tested. In vivo significance of a putative anesthetic target can now be examined by targeted gene manipulations in mice. In this review, we summarize from a molecular perspective recent advances in our understanding of mechanisms of action of general anesthetics on ligand-gated ion channels.},

@article{Ochoa1989,
abstract = {1. Loss of response after prolonged or repeated application of stimulus
is generally termed desensitization. A wide variety of phenomena
occurring in living organisms falls under this general definition
of desensitization. There are two main types of desensitization processes:
specific and non-specific. 2. Desensitization of the nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor is triggered by prolonged or repeated exposure to agonists
and results in inactivation of its ion channel. It is a case of specific
desensitization and is an intrinsic molecular property of the receptor.
3. Desensitization of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor at the
neuromuscular junction was first reported by Katz and Thesleff in
1957. Desensitization of the receptor has been demonstrated by rapid
kinetic techniques and also by the characteristic "burst kinetics"
obtained from single-channel recordings of receptor activity in native
as well as in reconstituted membranes. In spite of a number of studies,
the detailed molecular mechanism of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
desensitization is not known with certainty. The progress of desensitization
is accompanied by an increase in affinity of the receptor for its
agonist. This change in affinity is attributed to a conformational
change of the receptor, as detected by spectroscopic and kinetic
studies. A four-state general model is consistent with the major
experimental observations. 4. Desensitization of the nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor can be potentially modulated by exogenous and endogenous
substances and by covalent modifications of the receptor structure.
Modulators include the noncompetitive blockers, calcium, the thymic
hormone peptides (thymopoietin and thymopentin), substance P, the
calcitonin gene-related peptide, and receptor phosphorylation. Phosphorylation
is an important posttranslational covalent modification that is correlated
with the regulation and desensitization of the receptor through various
protein kinases. 5. Although the physiological significance of desensitization
of the nicotinic receptor is not yet fully understood, desensitization
of receptors probably plays a significant role in the operation of
the neuronal networks associated in memory and learning processes.
Desensitization of the nicotinic receptor could also possibly be
related to the neuromuscular disease, myasthenia gravis.},

abstract = {Interactions between lipids and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
from Torpedo californica have been measured in reconstituted membranes
containing purified receptor and defined lipids. The ability of brominated
lipids to partially quench the intrinsic fluorescence of the acetylcholine
receptor has been exploited to monitor contacts between the protein
and the surrounding lipid. Relative binding constants for lipid binding
to the protein have been quantitatively determined by measuring quenching
observed in mixtures of brominated and nonbrominated lipids by use
of equilibrium exchange equations developed by London and Feigenson
[London, E., {\&} Feigenson, G. W. (1981) Biochemistry 20, 1939-1948]

G. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 1432-1441]. Dioleoylphosphatidylcholine
and its dibromo derivative are the two principal lipids used in the
reconstituted membranes to establish the quenching parameters. Competition
studies between cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine indicate that
cholesterol does not compete effectively for the phospholipid sites
presumed to surround the membrane-embedded portions of the receptor
(annular lipids). However, dibromocholesterol partially quenches
the receptor and leads to additional quenching of receptor in pure
dibromophosphatidylcholine membranes. The results are consistent
with the presence of additional binding sites for cholesterol that
are not accessible to phospholipids (nonannular sites). Similar results
are obtained by using cholesterol hemisuccinate and its dibromo analogue,
both of which can be introduced into membranes more easily than cholesterol
because of their greater solubility in water. Fatty acids appear
to compete for both annular and nonannular sites, and analysis of
the quenching data suggests that there are 5-10 nonannular sites
associated with the receptor. Cholesterol has been shown to play
a critical role in both acetylcholine receptor structural stabilization
and ion channel activity, and the results presented here provide
additional information about cholesterol-receptor interactions.},

abstract = {The X-ray structure of a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel from
Erwinia chrysanthemi (ELIC) has recently provided structural insight
into this family of ion channels at high resolution. The structure
shows a homo-pentameric protein with a barrel-stave architecture
that defines an ion-conduction pore located on the fivefold axis
of symmetry. In this structure, the wide aqueous vestibule that is
encircled by the extracellular ligand-binding domains of the five
subunits narrows to a discontinuous pore that spans the lipid bilayer.
The pore is constricted by bulky hydrophobic residues towards the
extracellular side, which probably serve as barriers that prevent
the diffusion of ions. This interrupted pore architecture in ELIC
thus depicts a non-conducting conformation of a pentameric ligand-gated
ion channel, the thermodynamically stable state in the absence of
bound ligand. As ligand binding promotes pore opening in these ion
channels and the specific ligand for ELIC has not yet been identified,
we have turned our attention towards a homologous protein from the
cyanobacterium Gloebacter violaceus (GLIC). GLIC was shown to form
proton-gated channels that are activated by a pH decrease on the
extracellular side and that do not desensitize after activation.
Both prokaryotic proteins, ELIC and GLIC form ion channels that are
selective for cations over anions with poor discrimination among
monovalent cations, characteristics that resemble the conduction
properties of the cation-selective branch of the family that includes
acetylcholine and serotonin receptors. Here we present the X-ray
structure of GLIC at 3.1 A resolution. The structure reveals a conformation
of the channel that is distinct from ELIC and that probably resembles
the open state. In combination, both structures suggest a novel gating
mechanism for pentameric ligand-gated ion channels where channel
opening proceeds by a change in the tilt of the pore-forming helices.},

abstract = {Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) are key players in the early events of electrical signal transduction at chemical synapses. The family codes for a structurally conserved scaffold of channel proteins that open in response to the binding of neurotransmitter molecules. All proteins share a pentameric organization of identical or related subunits that consist of an extracellular ligand-binding domain followed by a transmembrane channel domain. The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is the most thoroughly studied member of the pLGIC family (for recent reviews see refs 1-3). Two sources of structural information provided an architectural framework for the family. The structure of the soluble acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP) defined the organization of the extracellular domain and revealed the chemical basis of ligand interaction. Electron microscopy studies of the nAChR from Torpedo electric ray have yielded a picture of the full-length protein and have recently led to the interpretation of an electron density map at 4.0 A resolution. Despite the wealth of experimental information, high-resolution structures of any family member have so far not been available. Until recently, the pLGICs were believed to be only expressed in multicellular eukaryotic organisms. The abundance of prokaryotic genome sequences, however, allowed the identification of several homologous proteins in bacterial sources. Here we present the X-ray structure of a prokaryotic pLGIC from the bacterium Erwinia chrysanthemi (ELIC) at 3.3 A resolution. Our study reveals the first structure of a pLGIC at high resolution and provides an important model system for the investigation of the general mechanisms of ion permeation and gating within the family.},

@article{Haddadian2008,
abstract = {The neuronal alpha4beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR)
is one of the most widely expressed nAChR subtypes in the brain.
Its subunits have high sequence identity (54 and 46{\%} for alpha4
and beta2, respectively) with alpha and beta subunits in Torpedo
nAChR. Using the known structure of the Torpedo nAChR as a template,
the closed-channel structure of the alpha4beta2 nAChR was constructed
through homology modeling. Normal-mode analysis was performed on
this closed structure and the resulting lowest frequency mode was
applied to it for a "twist-to-open" motion, which increased the minimum
pore radius from 2.7 to 3.4 A and generated an open-channel model.
Nicotine could bind to the predicted agonist binding sites in the
open-channel model but not in the closed one. Both models were subsequently
equilibrated in a ternary lipid mixture via extensive molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations. Over the course of 11 ns MD simulations, the open
channel remained open with filled water, but the closed channel showed
a much lower water density at its hydrophobic gate comprised of residues
alpha4-V259 and alpha4-L263 and their homologous residues in the
beta2 subunits. Brownian dynamics simulations of Na+ permeation through
the open channel demonstrated a current-voltage relationship that
was consistent with experimental data on the conducting state of
alpha4beta2 nAChR. Besides establishment of the well-equilibrated
closed- and open-channel alpha4beta2 structural models, the MD simulations
on these models provided valuable insights into critical factors
that potentially modulate channel gating. Rotation and tilting of
TM2 helices led to changes in orientations of pore-lining residue
side chains. Without concerted movement, the reorientation of one
or two hydrophobic side chains could be enough for channel opening.
The closed- and open-channel structures exhibited distinct patterns
of electrostatic interactions at the interface of extracellular and
transmembrane domains that might regulate the signal propagation
of agonist binding to channel opening. A potential prominent role
of the beta2 subunit in channel gating was also elucidated in the
study.},

abstract = {Torpedo acetylcholine receptor was reconstituted into liposomes of
pure synthetic lipids in order to study the influence of the lipid
environment on affinity state transitions and the ion translocation
function of the receptor. A critical concentration of 30 to 40{\%}
of cholesteryl hemisuccinate was necessary in liposomes made of cholesteryl
hemisuccinate and dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine to mimic the kinetics
of agonist-induced state transitions observed in native membranes.
With increasing chain length of the saturated lecithins, a marked
increase in carbamylcholine dissociation constants was observed.
Substitution by other dimyristoyl phospholipids for dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine
had the same, though quantitatively less pronounced effects. Introduction
of unsaturation in the acyl chains reverted the effect of increasing
chain length. Unsaturated phosphatidylethanolamines in combination
with 28-35 mol{\%} of cholesteryl hemisuccinate was the best lipid
mixture for reconstitution of the receptor-gating function. When
phosphatidylethanolamine was replaced totally or partially by other
phospholipids with the same or different acyl chain composition,
a marked decrease of ion transport was apparent, even when similar
vesicle size, receptor incorporation, and agonist-induced affinity
transitions were obtained. Therefore, the maintenance of the affinity
state transitions of the reconstituted receptor is a necessary but
not sufficient condition for the manifestation of the ion-gating
receptor activity. On the other hand, the more unsaturated the acyl
chains of phosphatidylethanolamine are, the higher the response that
was observed, suggesting that a critical lipid packing is essential
for the ion translocation function of the receptor.},

40{\%} efficiency by 1{\%} beta-octyl glucoside. Reconstitution was achieved
by mixing the solubilized proteins with a 4:1 mixture of soybean
asolectin and bovine brain phospholipids, followed by chromatography
on Sephadex G-50-80 to remove detergent. The incorporation of the
GABAA receptor into membrane vesicles has been verified by sucrose

comigrated with [14C]phosphatidylcholine used as a lipid marker.
Vesicles prepared without labeled markers retained the ability to
bind both [3H]flunitrazepam and the GABA analogue [3H]muscimol. Furthermore,
the binding parameters were very similar to those measured using
native membrane preparations. A novel fluorescence technique has
been used to measure chloride transport mediated by the GABAA receptor

levels of anesthetics are very small. Effects on most proteins are

sensitive to anesthetics and mimic the pharmacological profile of
anesthetic target sites in animals. Such target sites are amphiphilic

components appear to behave as good hydrogen-bond acceptors but poor
hydrogen-bond donors. Although the targets can accept molecules with
a wide variety of shapes and chemical groupings, they are unaffected

abstract = {Cholesterol modulates the plasmalemma's biophysical properties and
influences the function and trafficking of membrane proteins. A fundamental
phenomenon that remains obscure is how the plasmalemma's lipid composition
regulates the activatable pool of membrane receptors. An outstanding
model to study this phenomenon is the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
(nAChR), since the nAChR activatable pool has been estimated to be
but a small fraction of the receptors present in the plasmalemma.
Studies on the effect of cholesterol depletion in the function of
the Torpedo californica nAChR, using the lipid-exposed nAChR mutation
(alphaC418W) that produces a congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS),
demonstrated that cholesterol depletion causes a remarkable increase
in the alphaC418W nAChR's macroscopic current whereas not in the
wild-type (WT). A variety of approaches were used to define the mechanism
responsible for the cholesterol depletion mediated-increase in the
alphaC418W nAChR's macroscopic current. The present study suggests
that a substantial fraction of the alphaC418W nAChRs is located in
caveolin-1-positive domains, "trapped" in a non-activatable state,
and that membrane cholesterol depletion results in the relocation
of these receptors to the activatable pool. Co-fractionation and
co-immunoprecipitation of the alphaC418W nAChR and the membrane raft
protein caveolin-1 (cav1) support the notion that interactions at
lipid-exposed domains regulate the partition of the receptor into
membrane raft microdomains. These results have potential implications

the circulatory system and plays a key role in the transport of fatty
acids, metabolites, and drugs. For many drugs, binding to serum albumin
is a critical determinant of their distribution and pharmacokinetics;
however, there have as yet been no high resolution crystal structures
published of drug-albumin complexes. Here we describe high resolution
crystal structures of HSA with two of the most widely used general
anesthetics, propofol and halothane. In addition, we describe a crystal
structure of HSA complexed with both halothane and the fatty acid,
myristate. We show that the intravenous anesthetic propofol binds
at two discrete sites on HSA in preformed pockets that have been
shown to accommodate fatty acids. Similarly we show that the inhalational
agent halothane binds (at concentrations in the pharmacologically
relevant range) at three sites that are also fatty acid binding loci.
At much higher halothane concentrations, we have identified additional
sites that are occupied. All of the higher affinity anesthetic binding
sites are amphiphilic in nature, with both polar and apolar parts,
and anesthetic binding causes only minor changes in local structure.},

receptor from the electric tissue of Torpedo californica is a dimer
of Mr = 500,000, cross-linked by a disulfide bond between the largest
(delta) of the five chains (alpha 2 beta gamma delta) that comprise
the monomer. Small-angle neutron scattering of purified receptor
dimer in Triton X-100 solution containing 18{\%} D2O, in which the
Triton X-100 is contrast-matched, yields a radius of gyration of
the dimer of 66 A. Based on the assumptions that the dimer is symmetrical
and that the radius of gyration of the monomer does not change in
forming dimer, this value, together with the radius of gyration of
the receptor monomer (46 A), determined previously, allows the calculation
of the distance separating the centers of neutron scattering density
of monomers in a dimer; the result is 96 A. Electron microscopy of
negatively stained dimers permits an independent measurement of the
distance between the apparent centers of mass of the monomers; the
average is 96 A, in agreement with the result of the neutron scattering
analysis. The electron micrographs of dimer also permit the location
of the delta chains at the region of contact of the monomers. A model
for the receptor dimer consistent with all available structural information

a cholate dialysis procedure with lipid to protein ratios of 100-400
to 1 (mol/mol). Spin-labeled lipids were incorporated into the reconstituted
membranes and into native membranes prepared from Torpedo electroplax,
and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded between
0 and 20 degrees C. The spin-labels included nitroxide derivatives
of stearic acid (16-doxylstearic acid), androstane, phosphatidylcholine
(PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), and
phosphatidic acid (PA). The phospholipid spin-labels had 16-doxylstearic
acid in the sn-2 position. All the spectra showed two components
corresponding to a relatively mobile bilayer component and a motionally
restricted "protein-perturbed" component. The relative amounts of
mobile and perturbed components were quantitated by spectral subtraction
and integration techniques. The mobile/perturbed ratio was somewhat
temperature dependent, and the results are discussed in terms of
exchange between mobile and perturbed environments. Plots of the
mobile/perturbed ratios vs. lipid/protein ratios at 1 degree C gave
straight lines from which the relative binding affinity of each spin-label
and the number of perturbed lipids per receptor protein could be
calculated. All the spin-labels gave similar values for the number
of perturbed lipids (40 +/- 7), a number close to the number of lipids
that will fit around the intramembranous perimeter of the receptor.
The affinities of the spin-labeled lipids for the receptor relative
to DOPC were androstane (K = 4.3) congruent to 16-doxylstearic acid
(4.1) greater than PA (2.7) greater than PE (1.1) approximately PC
(1.0) approximately PS (0.7). The lipids having the highest affinity
for the acetylcholine receptor were also those that have the largest
effects on the ion flux functional properties of the receptor, and
the results are discussed in terms of lipid effects on receptor function.},

are strongly supported by mutagenesis data for picrotoxinin and lindane,

compounds, 1-chloro-1,2,2-trifluorocyclobutane (F3) and 1,2-dichlorohexafluorocyclobutane

the former is a potent general anesthetic, the latter produces no
anesthesia. Two linear compounds, isoflurane and 2,3-dichlorooctofluorobutane
(F8), although not a structural pair, also show the same anesthetic
discrepancy. Using 19F nuclear magnetic spectroscopy, we investigated
the time-averaged submolecular distribution of these compounds in

model was used to interpret the observed changes in resonance frequencies
as a function of the solubilization of these compounds in membrane

F3 and isoflurane distributed preferentially to regions of the membrane
that permit easy contact with water. The frequency changes of these
two anesthetics can be well characterized by the two-site exchange
model. In contrast, the nonanesthetics F6 and F8 solubilized deeply
into the lipid core, and their frequency change significantly deviated
from the prediction of the model. It is concluded that although anesthetics

abstract = {The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is a cation-selective, ligand-gated
ion channel, involved in signal transmission at the chemical synapse.
This paper reports the three-dimensional appearance of the channel
in the closed conformation, at 9 A resolution. The structure was
determined by electron microscopy of tubular crystals of Torpedo
postsynaptic membranes embedded in amorphous ice. The analysis was
carried out by averaging data from separate images, using helical
diffraction methods. The images were recorded over a wide range of
defocus (7000 to 18,800 A) so that all spacings in the object were
well sampled. Tubes of only one kind ((-16.6) helical family) were
processed, so that the Fourier terms could be averaged directly in
reciprocal space. The three-dimensional map, obtained from 26 images,
resolves some elements of secondary structure within the five protein
subunits. In the synaptic part of each subunit, about 30 A from the
bilayer surface, there is a group of three rods that are oriented
predominantly perpendicular to the plane of the bilayer and twist
around each other as in a left-handed coil. These rods presumably
are alpha-helices. Two of them line the entrance to the channel,
and the third is on the outside. The distinctive appearance of the
alpha subunits in this region suggests that the rods may be involved
in forming the binding pocket for acetylcholine. In the bilayer-spanning
part of each subunit there is only one rod clearly visible, which
forms the wall lining the pore, and so is assumed to be the transmembrane
helix, M2. This rod does not form a straight path through the lipid
bilayer, but bends, or kinks, near its mid-point, where it is closest
to the axis of the pore, and tilts radially outwards on either side.
It is flanked on the lipid-facing sides by a continuous rim of density,
which seems likely to be composed of beta-sheet. A tentative alignment
is made between the three-dimensional densities and the sequence
of M2, based on correlation of the appearance of the rods with a
special pattern of amino acid residues in the sequence. This alignment
places the charged groups at the ends of M2 symmetrically on either
side of the bilayer, and a highly conserved leucine residue (Leu251
of the alpha subunit) at the level of the kink.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED

abstract = {GABA(A) receptors are the major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain and are the site of action of many clinically important drugs. These receptors are composed of five subunits that can belong to eight different subunit classes. If all GABA(A) receptor subunits could randomly combine with each other, an extremely large number of GABA(A) receptor subtypes with distinct subunit composition and arrangement would be formed. Depending on their subunit composition, these receptors would exhibit distinct pharmacological and electrophysiological properties. Recent evidence, however, indicates that not all subunits can assemble efficiently with each other and form functional homo- or hetero-oligomeric receptors. In addition, the efficiency of formation of hetero-oligomeric assembly intermediates determines the subunit stoichiometry and subunit arrangement for each receptor and thus further reduces the possible heterogeneity of GABA(A) receptors in the brain. Studies investigating the subunit composition of native GABA(A) receptors support this conclusion, but also indicate that receptors composed of one, two, three, four, or five different subunits might exist in the brain. Using a recently established immunodepletion technique, the subunit composition and quantitative importance of native GABA(A) receptor subtypes can be determined. This information, together with studies on the regional, cellular and subcellular distribution of these receptor subtypes, will be the basis for a rational development of drugs that specifically affect the GABAergic system.},

abstract = {Although general anesthetics are known to modulate the activity of ligand-gated ion channels in the Cys-loop superfamily, there is at present neither consensus on the underlying mechanisms, nor predictive models of this modulation. Viable models need to offer quantitative assessment of the relative importance of several identified anesthetic binding sites. However, to date, precise affinity data for individual sites has been challenging to obtain by biophysical means. Here, the likely role of pore block inhibition by the general anesthetics isoflurane and propofol of the prokaryotic pentameric channel GLIC is investigated by molecular simulations. Microscopic affinities are calculated for both single and double occupancy binding of isoflurane and propofol to the GLIC pore. Computations are carried out for an open-pore conformation in which the pore is restrained to crystallographic radius, and a closed-pore conformation that results from unrestrained molecular dynamics equilibration of the structure. The GLIC pore is predicted to be blocked at the micromolar concentrations for which inhibition by isofluorane and propofol is observed experimentally. Calculated affinities suggest that pore block by propofol occurs at signifcantly lower concentrations than those for which inhibition is observed: we argue that this discrepancy may result from binding of propofol to an allosteric site recently identified by X-ray crystallography, which may cause a competing gain-of-function effect. Affinities of isoflurane and propofol to the allosteric site are also calculated, and shown to be 3 mM for isoflurane and 10 $\mu$M for propofol; both anesthetics have a lower affinity for the allosteric site than for the unoccupied pore.},

abstract = {The recent cryoelectron microscopy structure of the Torpedo nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) at 4-A resolution shows long helices
for all transmembrane (TM) domains. This is in disagreement with
several previous reports that the first TM domain of nAChR and other
Cys-loop receptors are not entirely helical. In this study, we determined
the structure and backbone dynamics of an extended segment encompassing
the first TM domain (TM1e) of nAChR beta(2) subunit in dodecylphosphocholine
micelles, using solution-state NMR and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy.
Both CD and NMR results show less helicity in TM1e than in Torpedo
nAChR structure (Protein Data Bank: 2BG9). The helical ending residues
at the C-terminus are the same in the TM1e NMR structure and the
Torpedo nAChR structure, but the helical starting residue (I-217)
in TM1e is seven residues closer to the C-terminus. Interestingly,
the helical starting residue is two residues before the highly conserved
P-219, in accordance with the hypothesis that proline causes helical
distortions at three residues preceding it. The NMR relaxation measurements
show a dynamics pattern consistent with TM1e structure. The substantial
nonhelical content adds greater flexibilities to TM1e, thereby implicating
a different molecular basis for nAChR function compared to a longer
and more rigid helical TM1.},

abstract = {Improving our understanding of the mechanisms and effects of anesthetics
is a critically important part of neuroscience. The currently dominant
theory is that anesthetics and similar molecules act by binding to
Cys-loop receptors in the postsynaptic terminal of nerve cells and
potentiate or inhibit their function. Although structures for some
of the most important mammalian channels have still not been determined,
a number of important results have been derived from work on homologous
cationic channels in bacteria. However, partly due to the lack of
a nervous system in bacteria, there are a number of questions about
how these results relate to higher organisms. The recent determination
of a structure of the eukaryotic chloride channel, GluCl, is an important
step toward accurate modeling of mammalian channels, because it is
more similar in function to human Cys-loop receptors such as GABAAR
or GlyR. One potential issue with using GluCl to model other receptors
is the presence of the large ligand ivermectin (IVM) positioned between
all five subunits. Here, we have performed a series of microsecond
molecular simulations to study how the dynamics and structure of
GluCl change in the presence versus absence of IVM. When the ligand
is removed, subunits move at least 2 {\AA}closer to each other compared
to simulations with IVM bound. In addition, the pore radius shrinks
to 1.2 {\AA}, all of which appears to support a model where IVM binding
between subunits stabilizes an open state, and that the relaxed nonIVM
conformations might be suitable for modeling other channels. Interestingly,
the presence of IVM also has an effect on the structure of the important
loop C located at the neurotransmitter-binding pocket, which might
help shed light on its partial agonist behavior.},

abstract = {A photoactivatable steroid, p-azidophenacyl 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 beta-cholan-24-
ate (APL), has been synthesized and used instead of cholesterol to
functionally reconstitute purified acetylcholine receptor (AcChR)
into vesicles made of asolectin phospholipids. Upon irradiation,
the extent of AcChR photolabeling by APL is directly proportional
to the amount of APL incorporated into the reconstituted vesicles
and the maximum stoichiometry observed corresponds to approx. 50
mol of APL bound per mol of AcChR. Furthermore, all four subunits
of the AcChR become labeled by APL and the observed labeling pattern
resembles the 2:1:1:1 stoichiometry characteristic of these subunits
within the AcChR complex. The presence of either cholesterol or neutral
lipids from asolectin in the reconstituted bilayer decreases both,
the incorporation of APl into the vesicles and the covalent labeling
of the AcChR upon irradiation, without altering the stoichiometry
of labeling in AcChR subunits stated above. This suggests that the
potential interaction sites for the photoactivatable probe in the
reconstituted AcChR are mostly those normally occupied by the natural
neutral lipids. Carbamylcholine, a cholinergic agonist, also reduces
the extent of APL photolabeling of the AcChR in a dose-dependent
manner but, in contrast to the effects of cholesterol, the presence
of carbamylcholine alters the stoichiometry of labeling in the AcChR
subunits. This, along with the observation that such a decrease in
the extent of APL photolabeling caused by carbamylcholine can be
blocked by preincubation with alpha-bungarotoxin, suggest that AcChR
desensitization induced by prolonged exposure to cholinergic agonists
encompasses a rearrangement of transmembrane portions of the AcChR
protein, which can be sensed by the photoactivatable probe. Conversely,
presence of (+)-tubocurarine, a competitive cholinergic antagonist,
has no effects on altering either the extent of APL photolabeling
of the AcChR or the distribution of the labeling among AcChR subunits.},

abstract = {Aggregation is a social behavior that varies between and within species, providing a model to study the genetic basis of behavioral diversity. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, aggregation is regulated by environmental context and by two neuromodulatory pathways, one dependent on the neuropeptide receptor NPR-1 and one dependent on the TGF-$\beta$ family protein DAF-7. To gain further insight into the genetic regulation of aggregation, we characterize natural variation underlying behavioral differences between two wild-type C. elegans strains, N2 and CB4856. Using quantitative genetic techniques, including a survey of chromosome substitution strains and QTL analysis of recombinant inbred lines, we identify three new QTLs affecting aggregation in addition to the two known N2 mutations in npr-1 and glb-5. Fine-mapping with near-isogenic lines localized one QTL, accounting for 5{\%}-8{\%} of the behavioral variance between N2 and CB4856, 3' to the transcript of the GABA neurotransmitter receptor gene exp-1. Quantitative complementation tests demonstrated that this QTL affects exp-1, identifying exp-1 and GABA signaling as new regulators of aggregation. exp-1 interacts genetically with the daf-7 TGF-$\beta$ pathway, which integrates food availability and population density, and exp-1 mutations affect the level of daf-7 expression. Our results add to growing evidence that genetic variation affecting neurotransmitter receptor genes is a source of natural behavioral variation.},

abstract = {The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) transduces binding of nerve-released ACh into opening of an intrinsic ion channel, yet the intraprotein interactions behind transduction remain to be fully elucidated. Attention has focused on the region of the AChR in which the beta1-beta2 and Cys-loops from the extracellular domain project into a cavity framed by residues preceding the first transmembrane domain (pre-M1) and the linker spanning transmembrane domains M2 and M3. Previous studies identified a principal transduction pathway in which the pre-M1 domain is coupled to the M2-M3 linker through the beta1-beta2 loop. Here we identify a parallel pathway in which the pre-M1 domain is coupled to the M2-M3 linker through the Cys-loop. Mutagenesis, single-channel kinetic analyses and thermodynamic mutant cycle analyses reveal energetic coupling among alphaLeu 210 from the pre-M1 domain, alphaPhe 135 and alphaPhe 137 from the Cys-loop, and alphaLeu 273 from the M2-M3 linker. Residues at equivalent positions of non-alpha-subunits show negligible coupling, indicating these interresidue couplings are specific to residues in the alpha-subunit. Thus, the extracellular beta1-beta2 and Cys-loops bridge the pre-M1 domain and M2-M3 linker to transduce agonist binding into channel gating.},

effect on ivermectin sensitivity, demonstrating that the ivermectin-

abstract = {Ivermectin is an anthelmintic drug that works by activating glutamate-gated
chloride channel receptors (GluClRs) in nematode parasites. GluClRs
belong to the Cys-loop receptor family that also includes glycine
receptor (GlyR) chloride channels. GluClRs and A288G mutant GlyRs
are both activated by low nanomolar ivermectin concentrations. The
crystal structure of the Caenorhabditis elegans $\alpha$ GluClR complexed
with ivermectin has recently been published. Here, we probed ivermectin
sensitivity determinants on the $\alpha$1 GlyR using site-directed mutagenesis
and electrophysiology. Based on a mutagenesis screen of transmembrane
residues, we identified Ala288 and Pro230 as crucial sensitivity
determinants. A comparison of the actions of selamectin and ivermectin
suggested the benzofuran C05-OH was required for high efficacy. When
taken together with docking simulations, these results supported
a GlyR ivermectin binding orientation similar to that seen in the
GluClR crystal structure. However, whereas the crystal structure
shows that ivermectin interacts with the alpha GluClR via H-bonds
with Leu218, Ser260, and Thr285 ($\alpha$ GluClR numbering), our data indicate
that H-bonds with residues homologous to Ser260 and Thr285 are not
important for high ivermectin sensitivity or direct agonist efficacy
in A288G $\alpha$1 GlyRs or three other GluClRs. Our data also suggest that
van der Waals interactions between the ivermectin disaccharide and
GlyR M2-M3 loop residues are unimportant for high ivermectin sensitivity.
Thus, although our results corroborate the ivermectin binding orientation
as revealed by the crystal structure, they demonstrate that some
of the binding interactions revealed by this structure do not pertain
to other highly ivermectin-sensitive Cys-loop receptors.},

a nonspecific manner on the central nervous system. More recent studies,
however, have revealed that the receptors for inhibitory neurotransmitters
such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine are sensitive
to clinically relevant concentrations of inhaled anaesthetics. The
function of GABA(A) and glycine receptors is enhanced by a number
of anaesthetics and alcohols, whereas activity of the related GABA
rho1 receptor is reduced. We have used this difference in pharmacology
to investigate the molecular basis for modulation of these receptors
by anaesthetics and alcohols. By using chimaeric receptor constructs,
we have identified a region of 45 amino-acid residues that is both
necessary and sufficient for the enhancement of receptor function.
Within this region, two specific amino-acid residues in transmembrane
domains 2 and 3 are critical for allosteric modulation of both GABA(A)

These observations support the idea that anaesthetics exert a specific
effect on these ion-channel proteins, and allow for the future testing
of specific hypotheses of the action of anaesthetics.},

of GABAergic transmission is strongly implicated in several debilitating
conditions such as panic disorder, major depression, schizophrenia,
alcohol dependence and catamenial epilepsy. Determining how neurosteroids
interact with the GABA(A) receptor is a prerequisite for understanding
their physiological and pathophysiological roles in the brain. Here
we identify two discrete binding sites in the receptor's transmembrane
domains that mediate the potentiating and direct activation effects
of neurosteroids. They potentiate GABA responses from a cavity formed
by the alpha-subunit transmembrane domains, whereas direct receptor
activation is initiated by interfacial residues between alpha and
beta subunits and is enhanced by steroid binding to the potentiation
site. Thus, significant receptor activation by neurosteroids relies
on occupancy of both the activation and potentiation sites. These
sites are highly conserved throughout the GABA(A )receptor family,
and their identification provides a unique opportunity for the development
of new therapeutic, neurosteroid-based ligands and transgenic disease
models of neurosteroid dysfunction.},

An improved experimental density map was obtained from 342 electron images of helical tubes, and the refined structure was derived to an R-factor of 36.7{\%} (R(free) 37.9{\%}) by standard crystallographic methods, after placing the densities corresponding to a single molecule into an artificial unit cell. The agreement between experimental and calculated phases along the helical layer-lines was used to monitor progress in the refinement and to give an independent measure of the accuracy. The atomic model allowed a detailed description of the whole receptor in the closed-channel form, including the ligand-binding and intracellular domains, which have not previously been interpreted at a chemical level. We confirm that the two ligand-binding alpha subunits have a different extended conformation from the three other subunits in the closed channel, and identify several interactions on both pairs of subunit interfaces, and within the alpha subunits, which may be responsible for their "distorted" structures. The ACh-coordinating amino acid side-chains of the alpha subunits are far apart in the closed channel, indicating that a localised rearrangement, involving closure of loops B and C around the bound ACh molecule, occurs upon activation. A comparison of the structure of the alpha subunit with that of AChBP having ligand present, suggests how the localised rearrangement overcomes the distortions and initiates the rotational movements associated with opening of the channel. Both vestibules of the channel are strongly electronegative, providing a cation-stabilising environment at either entrance of the membrane pore. Access to the pore on the intracellular side is further influenced by narrow lateral windows, which would be expected to screen out electrostatically ions of the wrong charge and size.},

abstract = {Volatility and low-affinity hamper an ability to define molecular
targets of the inhaled anesthetics. Photolabels have proven to be
a useful approach in this regard, although none have closely mimicked
contemporary drugs. We report here the synthesis and validation of
azi-isoflurane, a compound constructed by adding a diazirinyl moiety
to the methyl carbon of the commonly used general anesthetic isoflurane.
Azi-isoflurane is slightly more hydrophobic than isoflurane, and
more potent in tadpoles. This novel compound inhibits Shaw2 K(+)
channel currents similarly to isoflurane and binds to apoferritin
with enhanced affinity. Finally, when irradiated at 300 nm, azi-isoflurane
adducts to residues known to line isoflurane-binding sites in apoferritin
and integrin LFA-1, the only proteins with isoflurane binding sites
defined by crystallography. This reagent should allow rapid discovery
of isoflurane molecular targets and binding sites within those targets.},

abstract = {Physiologic sites for inhaled anesthetics are presumed to be cavities
within transmembrane 4-alpha-helix bundles of neurotransmitter receptors,
but confirmation of binding and structural detail of such sites remains
elusive. To provide such detail, we screened soluble proteins containing
this structural motif, and found only one that exhibited evidence
of strong anesthetic binding. Ferritin is a 24-mer of 4-alpha-helix
bundles; both halothane and isoflurane bind with K(A) values of approximately
10(5) M(-1), higher than any previously reported inhaled anesthetic-protein
interaction. The crystal structures of the halothane/apoferritin
and isoflurane/apoferritin complexes were determined at 1.75 A resolution,
revealing a common anesthetic binding pocket within an interhelical
dimerization interface. The high affinity is explained by several
weak polar contacts and an optimal host/guest packing relationship.
Neither the acidic protons nor ether oxygen of the anesthetics contribute
to the binding interaction. Compared with unliganded apoferritin,
the anesthetic produced no detectable alteration of structure or
B factors. The remarkably high affinity of the anesthetic/apoferritin
complex implies greater selectivity of protein sites than previously
thought, and suggests that direct protein actions may underlie effects
at lower than surgical levels of anesthetic, including loss of awareness.},

abstract = {Identification of bacterial and archaeal counterparts to eukaryotic
ion channels has greatly facilitated studies of structural biophysics
of the channels. Often, searches based only on sequence alignment
tools are inadequate for discovering such distant bacterial and archaeal
counterparts. We address the discovery of bacterial and archaeal
members of the Pentameric Ligand-Gated Ion Channel (pLGIC) family
by a combination of four computational methods. One domain-based
method involves retrieval of proteins with pLGIC-relevant domains
by matching those domains to previously established domain templates
in the InterPro family of databases. The second domain-based method
involves searches using ungapped de-novo motifs discovered by MEME
which were trained with well characterized members of the pLGIC family.
The third and fourth methods involve the use of two sequence alignment
search algorithms BLASTp and psiBLAST respectively. The sequences
returned from all methods were screened by having the correct topology
for pLGIC's, and by returning an annotated member of this family
as one of the first ten hits using BLASTp against a comprehensive
database of eukaryotic proteins. We found the domain based searches
to have high specificity but low sensitivity, while the sequence
alignment methods have higher sensitivity but lower specificity.
The four methods together discovered 69 putative bacterial and archaeal
members of the pLGIC family. We ranked and divide the 69 proteins
into groups according to the similarity of their domain compositions
with known eukaryotic pLGIC's. One especially notable group is more
closely related to eukaryotic pLGIC's than to any other known protein
family, and has the overall topology of pLGIC's, but the functional
domains they contain are sufficiently different from those found
in known pLGIC's that they do not score very well against the pLGIC
domain templates. We conclude that multiple methods used in a coordinated
fashion outperform any single method for identifying likely distant
bacterial and archaeal proteins that may provide useful models for
important eukaryotic channel function. We note also that the methods
used here are largely standard and readily accessible. The novelty
is in the effectiveness of a strategy that combines these methods
for identifying bacterial and archea relatives of this family. Therefore
the paper may serve as a template for a broad group of workers to
reliably identify bacterial and archaeal counterparts to eukaryotic
proteins.},

(DOPC) lipids, with embedded alpha-helical peptide bundles based
on the membrane-bound portions of the alpha- and delta-subunits,
respectively, of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. In the molecular
dynamics simulations halothane molecules spontaneously partitioned
into the DOPC bilayer and then preferentially occupied regions close
to lipid headgroups. A single halothane molecule was observed to
bind to tyrosine (Tyr-277) residue in the alpha-subunit, an experimentally
identified specific binding site. The binding of halothane attenuated
the local loop dynamics of alpha-subunit and significantly influenced
global concerted motions suggesting anesthetic action in modulating
protein function. Steered molecular dynamics calculations on a single
halothane molecule partitioned into a DOPC lipid bilayer were performed
to probe the free energy profile of halothane across the lipid-water
interface and rationalize the observed spontaneous partitioning.
Partitioned halothane molecules affect the hydrocarbon chains of
the DOPC lipid, by lowering of the hydrocarbon tilt angles. The anesthetic
molecules also caused a decrease in the number of peptide-lipid contacts.
The observed local and global effects of anesthetic binding on protein

directly occludes the pore near its cytosolic base. GluCl provides

phospholipid and cholesterol (Chol), led to the identification of
discrete sites for these lipids on the AChR protein, and electron-spin

of the stoichiometry and selectivity for the AChR of the shell lipid.
The influence of lipids on AChR function is discussed next. Combined
single-channel and site-directed mutagenesis data fostered the recognition

To investigate structural bases for the dynamics (MD) simulations, X-ray crystallography, and single channel recording. MD simulations of the muscle nicotinic receptor, imbedded in a lipid bilayer with an applied transmembrane potential, reveal single cation translocation events during transient periods of channel hydration. During the simulation trajectory, cations paused for prolonged periods near several rings of anionic residues projecting from the lumen of the extracellular domain of the receptor, but subsequently the cation moved rapidly through the hydrophobic transmembrane region as the constituent alpha-helices exhibited back and forth rocking motions. Cocrystallization of acetylcholine binding protein with sulfate ions revealed coordination of five sulfates with residues from one of these charged rings; in cation-selective Cys-loop receptors this ring contains negatively charged residues, whereas in anion-selective receptors it contains positively charged residues. In the muscle nicotinic receptor, charge reversal of residues of this ring decreases unitary conductance by up to 80{\%}. Thus in Cys-loop receptors, a series of charged rings along the ion translocation pathway concentrates hydrated ions relative to bulk solution, giving rise to charge selectivity, and then subtle motions of the hydrophobic transmembrane, coupled with transient periods of water filling, enable rapid ion flux.},

abstract = {The ligand-gated ion channel from Erwinia chrysanthemi (ELIC) is a prokaryotic homolog of the eukaryotic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) that responds to the binding of neurotransmitter acetylcholine and mediates fast signal transmission. ELIC is similar to the nAChR in its primary sequence and overall subunit organization, but despite their structural similarity, it is not clear whether these two ligand-gated ion channels operate in a similar manner. Further, it is not known to what extent mechanistic insights gleaned from the ELIC structure translate to eukaryotic counterparts such as the nAChR. Here we use molecular-dynamics simulations to probe the conformational dynamics and hydration of the transmembrane pore of ELIC. The results are compared with those from our previous simulation of the human alpha7 nAChR. Overall, ELIC displays increased stability compared to the nAChR, whereas the two proteins exhibit remarkable similarity in their global motion and flexibility patterns. The majority of the increased stability of ELIC does not stem from the deficiency of the models used in the simulations, and but rather seems to have a structural basis. Slightly altered dynamical correlation features are also observed among several loops within the membrane region. In sharp contrast to the nAChR, ELIC is completely dehydrated from the pore center to the extracellular end throughout the simulation. Finally, the simulation of an ELIC mutant substantiates the important role of F246 on the stability, hydration and possibly function of the ELIC channel.},

The gate is a constricting hydrophobic girdle at the middle of the

triggers rotations of the protein chains on opposite sides of the
entrance to the pore. These rotations are communicated through the
inner helices, and open the pore by breaking the girdle apart.},

@article{Miller2002,
abstract = {The molecular nature of the site of general anaesthesia has long been
sought through the process of comparing the in vivo potencies of
general anaesthetics with their physical properties, particularly
their ability to dissolve in solvents of various polarities. This
approach has led to the conclusion that the site of general anaesthesia
is largely apolar but contains a strong polar component. However,
there is growing evidence that several physiological targets underlie
general anaesthesia, and that different agents may act selectively
on subsets of these targets. Consequently research now focuses on
the details of general-anaesthetic-protein interactions. There are
large amounts of structural data that identify cavities where anaesthetics
bind on soluble proteins that are readily crystallizable. These proteins
serve as models, having no role in anaesthesia. Two problems make
studies of the more likely targets--excitable membrane proteins--difficult.
One is that they rarely crystallize and the other is that the sites
have their highest affinity for general anaesthetics when the channels
are in the open state. Such states rarely exist for more than tens
of milliseconds. Crystallographers are making progress with the first
problem, whilst anaesthesia researchers have developed a number of
strategies for addressing the second. Some of these (kinetic analysis,
site-directed mutagenesis) provide indirect evidence for sites and
their nature, whilst others seek direct identification of sites by
employing newly developed general anaesthetics that are photoaffinity
labels. Such studies on acetylcholine, glycine and GABA receptors
point to the existence of sites located within the plane of the membrane
either within the ion channel lumen (acetylcholine receptor), or
on the outer side of the alpha-helix lining that lumen (GABAA and
glycine receptors). Bound anaesthetics generally exert their actions
on ion channels by binding to allosteric sites whose topology varies
from one conformation to another, but definitive proof for this mechanism
remains elusive.},

that this steroid probe was incorporated into the AChR-rich membrane
vesicles in regions which were to a certain extent enriched preferentially
in the steroid, both in the presence and in the absence of local
anaesthetics. Since the nitroxide group present in CSL is also a
paramagnetic quencher of the intrinsic protein fluorescence, this
property was used to characterize the AChR-steroid interactions.
The quenching induced by CSL was sensitive both to AChR concentration
and to the action of cholinergic agonists. In competition experiments,
the ability of CSL to quench the AChR intrinsic fluorescence was
markedly inhibited by benzocaine, tetracaine and QX-222 (a quaternary
trimethylammonium derivative of lidocaine), and was totally inhibited
by procaine. The effectiveness of local anaesthetics in inhibiting
CSL-induced quenching followed the order: procaine much greater than
benzocaine approximately greater than tetracaine greater than QX-222.
This inhibition effect was shown not to be charge-dependent. The
data can be interpreted in terms of a model requiring specific association
sites for local anaesthetics on the hydrophobic surface of the AChR

channel activity of purified acetylcholine receptor (AcChR) reconstituted

infrared spectroscopy and by rapid kinetics of cation influx. Reconstitution
of the AcChR in asolectin phospholipid vesicles in the absence of
either cholesterol or the nonpolar lipids present in crude asolectin
extracts results in a considerable loss of the ability of the AcChR
to support cation channel function. This functional loss is accompanied
by spectral changes in the conformationally-sensitive amide I band
of the protein infrared spectrum which are indicative of alteration
in the protein secondary structure. Quantitative estimation of such
alteration by band-fitting analysis reveals a marked decrease in
ordered protein structures such as the alpha-helix and beta-pleated
sheet, concomitant with an increase in less ordered structures appearing
at 1644 cm-1 in the infrared spectrum. Furthermore, the addition
of increasing amounts of cholesterol to the reconstituted bilayer
produces a progressive, complete recovery both in the control of
cation channel function and in the infrared spectrum. This restoration
of AcChR structure and function by cholesterol, however, does not
occur when the AcChR is reconstituted in vesicles made from purified

Refined structure of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor at 4 A
resolution. J Mol Biol 346:967-989]. Purified nAChR must be reconstituted
in a mixture containing cholesterol to function. Proposed modes of
interaction between cholesterol and the protein range from specific
binding to indirect membrane-mediated mechanisms. However, the underlying
cause of nAChR sensitivity to cholesterol remains controversial,
in part because the vast majority of functional studies were conducted
before a medium resolution structure was reported. We show that the
nAChR contains internal sites capable of containing cholesterol,
whose occupation stabilizes the protein structure. We detect sites
at the protein-lipid interface as conventionally predicted from functional
data, as well as deeply buried sites that are not usually considered.
Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that occupation of both superficial
and deeply buried sites most effectively preserves the experimental
structure; the structure collapses in the absence of bound cholesterol.
In particular, we find that bound cholesterol directly supports contacts
between the agonist-binding domain and the pore that are thought
to be essential for activation of the receptor. These results likely
apply to those other ion channels within the Cys-loop superfamily
that depend on cholesterol, such as the GABA receptor.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ivermectin is a gold standard anthelmintic drug that works
by potently depressing neuronal activity and muscular contractility
in arthropods and nematodes. At the molecular level, ivermectin activates
inhibitory glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluClRs), which are
found exclusively in invertebrates, at nanomolar concentrations.
These receptors belong to the pentameric Cys-loop receptor family
of ligand-gated ion channels. Higher (micromolar) concentrations
of ivermectin also activate and/or modulate vertebrate Cys-loop receptors,
including the excitatory nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and the
inhibitory GABA type-A and glycine receptors (GlyRs). In the last
twelve months, an X-ray crystal structure of ivermectin complexed
with the C. elegans a GluClR demonstrated that ivermectin binds to
the transmembrane region of the receptor in a cleft formed at the
interface of adjacent subunits. This study also identified three
critical hydrogen bonds that were thought to attach ivermectin to
its site. Site-directed mutagenesis and voltage-clamp electrophysiology
have also been employed to probe the binding sites for ivermectin
in the a1 GlyR. This study has raised doubts as to whether the hydrogen
bonds are important for high ivermectin potency in either GlyRs or
GluClRs. Due to its lipophilic nature, it is likely that ivermectin
accumulates in the membrane and binds reversibly (i.e., weakly) to
its target site. Several lines of evidence suggest that ivermectin
opens the channel pore via a structural change that is distinct from
that induced by the endogenous neurotransmitter agonist. Finally,
voltage-clamp fluorometry has demonstrated that ivermectin induces
a global conformational change that propagates to the neurotransmitter
binding site, thus suggesting a mechanism by which ivermectin may
potentiate neurotransmitter-gated currents. Together, this information
provides new insights into the mechanisms of action of this clinically
important drug.},

Here we describe the mechanism by which the neurosteroid 3alpha, 21-dihydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one (5alpha-THDOC) alleviates this malfunction of the mutated receptor transiently expressed in HEK293 cells. Two rapid reaction techniques, the cell-flow and the laser-pulse photolysis methods, were used in combination with whole-cell current recordings. 150-muM 5alpha-THDOC does not affect the rate constant for channel opening (k(op)) of approximately 250 s(-1) but does decrease the rate constant for channel closing (k(cl)) from 121 +/- 11 s(-1) to 56 +/- 21 s(-1). This results in an increase in the channel-opening equilibrium constant ((Phi(-1) = k(op)/k(cl)) by a factor of about 2, leading to about 50{\%} alleviation of the malfunction of the inheritable mutated (alpha1beta2gamma2L(K289M)) GABA(A) receptor linked to GEFS+.},

steroids) are potent modulators of GABA(A) receptors. Thus, they
are of physiological and clinical relevance for their ability to
modulate inhibitory function in the CNS. Despite their importance,
fundamental issues of neurosteroid actions remain unresolved. Recent
evidence suggests that glutamatergic principal neurons, rather than
glia, are the major sources of neurosteroid synthesis. Other recent
studies have identified putative neurosteroid binding sites on GABA(A)
receptors. In this Opinion, we argue that neurosteroids require a
membranous route of access to transmembrane-domain binding sites

future neuroactive steroids because the lipid solubility and related
accessibility properties of the ligand are likely to be key determinants
of receptor modulation.},

abstract = {Although the statistical thermodynamics of noncovalent binding has
been considered in a number of theoretical papers, few methods of
computing binding affinities are derived explicitly from this underlying
theory. This has contributed to uncertainty and controversy in certain
areas. This article therefore reviews and extends the connections
of some important computational methods with the underlying statistical
thermodynamics. A derivation of the standard free energy of binding
forms the basis of this review. This derivation should be useful
in formulating novel computational methods for predicting binding
affinities. It also permits several important points to be established.
For example, it is found that the double-annihilation method of computing
binding energy does not yield the standard free energy of binding,
but can be modified to yield this quantity. The derivation also makes
it possible to define clearly the changes in translational, rotational,
configurational, and solvent entropy upon binding. It is argued that
molecular mass has a negligible effect upon the standard free energy
of binding for biomolecular systems, and that the cratic entropy
defined by Gurney is not a useful concept. In addition, the use of
continuum models of the solvent in binding calculations is reviewed,
and a formalism is presented for incorporating a limited number of
solvent molecules explicitly.},

abstract = {The gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor represents an
elementary switching mechanism integral to the functioning of the
central nervous system and a locus for the action of many mood- and
emotion-altering agents such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, steroids,
and alcohol. Anxiety, sleep disorders, and convulsive disorders have
been effectively treated with therapeutic agents that enhance the
action of GABA at the GABAA receptor or increase the concentration
of GABA in nervous tissue. The GABAA receptor is a multimeric membrane-spanning
ligand-gated ion channel that admits chloride upon binding of the
neurotransmitter GABA and is modulated by many endogenous and therapeutically
important agents. Since GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter
in the CNS, modulation of its response has profound implications
for brain functioning. The GABAA receptor is virtually the only site
of action for the centrally acting benzodiazepines, the most widely
prescribed of the anti-anxiety medications. Increasing evidence points
to an important role for GABA in epilepsy and various neuropsychiatric
disorders. Recent advances in molecular biology and complementary
information derived from pharmacology, biochemistry, electrophysiology,
anatomy and cell biology, and behavior have led to a phenomenal growth
in our understanding of the structure, function, regulation, and
evolution of the GABAA receptor. Benzodiazepines, barbiturates, steroids,
polyvalent cations, and ethanol act as positive or negative modulators
of receptor function. The description of a receptor gene superfamily
comprising the subunits of the GABAA, nicotinic acetylcholine, and
glycine receptors has led to a new way of thinking about gene expression
and receptor assembly in the nervous system. Seventeen genetically
distinct subunit subtypes (alpha 1-alpha 6, beta 1-beta 4, gamma
1-gamma 4, delta, p1-p2) and alternatively spliced variants contribute
to the molecular architecture of the GABAA receptor. Mysteriously,
certain preferred combinations of subunits, most notably the alpha
1 beta 2 gamma 2 arrangement, are widely codistributed, while the
expression of other subunits, such as beta 1 or alpha 6, is severely
restricted to specific neurons in the hippocampal formation or cerebellar
cortex. Nervous tissue has the capacity to exert control over receptor
number, allosteric uncoupling, subunit mRNA levels, and posttranslational
modifications through cellular signal transduction mechanisms under
active investigation. The genomic organization of the GABAA receptor
genes suggests that the present abundance of subtypes arose during
evolution through the duplication and translocations of a primordial
alpha-beta-gamma gene cluster. This review describes these varied
aspects of GABAA receptor research with special emphasis on contemporary
cellular and molecular discoveries.},

Here we present the X-ray structure at 2.9 A resolution of the bacterial Gloeobacter violaceus pentameric ligand-gated ion channel homologue (GLIC) at pH 4.6 in an apparently open conformation. This cationic channel is known to be permanently activated by protons. The structure is arranged as a funnel-shaped transmembrane pore widely open on the outer side and lined by hydrophobic residues. On the inner side, a 5 A constriction matches with rings of hydrophilic residues that are likely to contribute to the ionic selectivity. Structural comparison with ELIC, a bacterial homologue from Erwinia chrysanthemi solved in a presumed closed conformation, shows a wider pore where the narrow hydrophobic constriction found in ELIC is removed. Comparative analysis of GLIC and ELIC reveals, in concert, a rotation of each extracellular beta-sandwich domain as a rigid body, interface rearrangements, and a reorganization of the transmembrane domain, involving a tilt of the M2 and M3 alpha-helices away from the pore axis. These data are consistent with a model of pore opening based on both quaternary twist and tertiary deformation.},

imposed by vesicle morphology, it was shown that polar conjugates

the chemical specificity of sterols. Affinity-purified nAcChoRs from

was still supported. The importance of cholesterol's planar ring

abstract = {The neurosteroid 3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one (allopregnanolone)
was administered systemically to rats which were tested in the Geller-Seifter
conflict paradigm, an established animal model of anxiety. Allopregnanolone
was found to produce significant anxiolytic-like effects at a dose
of 8 mg/kg. When three ligands that function at different sites on
the gamma-aminobutyric acid/benzodiazepine receptor-chloride ionophore
complex (GABA(A) receptors) were examined in conjunction with allopregnanolone,
the anti-conflict effects of allopregnanolone were effectively reversed
only by the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist RO15-4513 (ethyl-8-azido-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo
[1,5-alpha]-[1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate). Since this inverse
agonist has been reported to inhibit the GABA(A)-activated chloride
flux in neuronal membranes, it is likely that the stimulation of
the chloride channel in GABA(A) receptors is an important component
of the effects of allopregnanolone. In contrast, the benzodiazepine
receptor antagonist flumazenil (ethyl-8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo
[1,5-alpha]-[1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate) did not block the

does not bind at the benzodiazepine site directly. Isopropylbicyclophosphate,
which binds at the picrotoxinin site on the GABA(A) receptors and
blocks the behavioral actions of ethanol, also dose-dependently reversed
the anti-conflict effect of this neurosteroid. The results suggest
that allopregnanolone may be working either at a site specific for
the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist RO15-4513 or at the picrotoxinin
site to produce its potent anxiolytic-like behavioral effects.},

binding to an aromatic cage at the subunit interface induces a significant
contraction of loop C and other structural rearrangements in the
extracellular domain. The side chain of the pore-lining residue F247
reorients and the pore size consequently enlarges, but the channel
remains closed. We attribute the inability of acetylcholine to activate
ELIC primarily to weak cation-$\pi$ and electrostatic interactions in
the pocket, because an acetylcholine derivative with a simple quaternary-to-tertiary
ammonium substitution activates the channel. This study presents
a compelling case for understanding the structural underpinning of
the functional relationship between agonism and competitive antagonism

However, this glutamic acid is replaced by a nonacidic residue in some structurally distant members of the heme-copper oxidases, which have a tyrosine residue in the vicinity. Here, using cytochrome c oxidase from Paracoccus denitrificans, we show that replacement of the glutamic acid and a conserved glycine nearby lowers the catalytic activity to {\textless}0.1{\%} of the wild-type value. But if, in addition, a phenylalanine that lies close in the structure is changed to tyrosine, the activity rises more than 100-fold and proton translocation is restored. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the tyrosine can support a transient array of water molecules that may be essential for proton transfer in the heme-copper oxidases. Surprisingly, the glutamic acid is thus not indispensable, which puts important constraints on the catalytic mechanism of these enzymes.},

quantity. It is a first-order phase boundary in the phospholipid/cholesterol
phase diagram. There are many different solubility limits in the
literature, but no clear picture has emerged that can unify the disparate
results. We have studied the effects that different sample preparation
methods can have on the apparent experimental solubility limit. We
find that artifactual demixing of cholesterol can occur during conventional
sample preparation and that this demixed cholesterol may produce
artifactual cholesterol crystals. Therefore, phospholipid/cholesterol
suspensions which are prepared by conventional methods may manifest
variable, falsely low cholesterol solubility limits. We have developed
two novel preparative methods which are specifically designed to
prevent demixing during sample preparation. For detection of the
cholesterol crystals, X-ray diffraction has proven to be quantitative
and highly sensitive. Experiments based on these methods yield reproducible

We present evidence that these are true, equilibrium values. In contrast

acid. All of these receptors are thought to share structural characteristics,
but due to high sequence variation and limited structure availability,
our knowledge about allosteric binding sites is still limited. These
sites are frequent targets of anesthetic and alcohol molecules, and
are of high pharmacological importance. We used molecular simulations
to study ethanol binding and equilibrium exchange for the homomeric
?1 glycine receptor (GlyR?1), modeled on the structure of the Gloeobacter
violaceus pentameric ligand-gated channel. Ethanol has a well-known
potentiating effect and can be used in high concentrations. By performing
two microsecond-scale simulations of GlyR with/without ethanol, we
were able to observe spontaneous binding in cavities and equilibrium
ligand exchange. Of interest, it appears that there are ethanol-binding
sites both between and within the GlyR transmembrane subunits, with
the intersubunit site having the highest occupancy and slowest exchange
(200ns). This model site involves several residues that were previously
identified via mutations as being crucial for potentiation. Finally,
ethanol appears to stabilize the GlyR model built on a presumably
open form of the ligand-gated channel. This stabilization could help
explain the effects of allosteric ligand binding in Cys-loop receptors.},

abstract = {Alcoholism is a complex disease with both genetic and environmental
risk factors. To identify genes that affect the risk for alcoholism,
we systematically ascertained and carefully assessed individuals
in families with multiple alcoholics. Linkage and association analyses
suggested that a region of chromosome 4p contained genes affecting
a quantitative endophenotype, brain oscillations in the beta frequency
range (13-28 Hz), and the risk for alcoholism. To identify the individual
genes that affect these phenotypes, we performed linkage disequilibrium
analyses of 69 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) within a cluster
of four GABA(A) receptor genes, GABRG1, GABRA2, GABRA4, and GABRB1,
at the center of the linked region. GABA(A) receptors mediate important
effects of alcohol and also modulate beta frequencies. Thirty-one
SNPs in GABRA2, but only 1 of the 20 SNPs in the flanking genes,
showed significant association with alcoholism. Twenty-five of the
GABRA2 SNPs, but only one of the SNPs in the flanking genes, were
associated with the brain oscillations in the beta frequency. The
region of strongest association with alcohol dependence extended
from intron 3 past the 3' end of GABRA2; all 43 of the consecutive
three-SNP haplotypes in this region of GABRA2 were highly significant.
A three-SNP haplotype was associated with alcoholism, with P=.000000022.
No coding differences were found between the high-risk and low-risk
haplotypes, suggesting that the effect is mediated through gene regulation.
The very strong association of GABRA2 with both alcohol dependence
and the beta frequency of the electroencephalogram, combined with
biological evidence for a role of this gene in both phenotypes, suggest
that GABRA2 might influence susceptibility to alcohol dependence
by modulating the level of neural excitation.},

abstract = {Propofol is the most widely used injectable general anesthetic. Its
targets include ligand-gated ion channels such as the GABA(A) receptor,
but such receptor-channel complexes remain challenging to study at
atomic resolution. Until structural biology methods advance to the
point of being able to deal with systems such as the GABA(A) receptor,
it will be necessary to use more tractable surrogates to probe the
molecular details of anesthetic recognition. We have previously shown
that recognition of inhalational general anesthetics by the model
protein apoferritin closely mirrors recognition by more complex and
clinically relevant protein targets; here we show that apoferritin
also binds propofol and related GABAergic anesthetics, and that the
same binding site mediates recognition of both inhalational and injectable
anesthetics. Apoferritin binding affinities for a series of propofol
analogs were found to be strongly correlated with the ability to
potentiate GABA responses at GABA(A) receptors, validating this model
system for injectable anesthetics. High resolution x-ray crystal
structures reveal that, despite the presence of hydrogen bond donors
and acceptors, anesthetic recognition is mediated largely by van
der Waals forces and the hydrophobic effect. Molecular dynamics simulations
indicate that the ligands undergo considerable fluctuations about
their equilibrium positions. Finally, apoferritin displays both structural
and dynamic responses to anesthetic binding, which may mimic changes
elicited by anesthetics in physiologic targets like ion channels.},

abstract = {Photoaffinity labeling of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A))-receptors
(GABA(A)R) with an etomidate analog and mutational analyses of direct
activation of GABA(A)R by neurosteroids have each led to the proposal
that these structurally distinct general anesthetics bind to sites
in GABA(A)Rs in the transmembrane domain at the interface between
the beta and alpha subunits. We tested whether the two ligand binding
sites might overlap by examining whether neuroactive steroids inhibited
etomidate analog photolabeling. We previously identified (Li, G.

Positioning these two photolabeled amino acids in a single type of
binding site at the interface of beta and alpha subunits (two copies
per pentamer) is consistent with a GABA(A)R homology model based
upon the structure of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and with
recent alphaM1 to betaM3 cross-linking data. Biologically active
neurosteroids enhance rather than inhibit azietomidate photolabeling,
as assayed at the level of GABA(A)R subunits on analytical SDS-PAGE,
and protein microsequencing establishes that the GABA(A)R-modulating
neurosteroids do not inhibit photolabeling of GABA(A)R alpha1Met-236
or betaMet-286 but enhance labeling of alpha1Met-236. Thus modulatory
steroids do not bind at the same site as etomidate, and neither of
the amino acids identified as neurosteroid activation determinants

abstract = {Disturbances in critical cognitive processes, such as working memory,
are now regarded as core features of schizophrenia, but available
pharmacological treatments produce little or no improvement in these
cognitive deficits. Although other explanations are possible, these
cognitive deficits appear to reflect a disturbance in executive control,
the processes that facilitate complex information processing and
behavior and that include context representation and maintenance,
functions dependent on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).
Studies in non-human primates indicate that normal working memory
function depends upon appropriate GABA neurotransmission in the DLPFC,
and alterations in markers of GABA neurotransmission are well documented
in the DLPFC of subjects with schizophrenia.Thus, the purpose of
this paper is to review the nature of the altered GABA neurotransmission
in the DLPFC in schizophrenia, and to consider how these findings
might inform the search for new treatments for cognitive dysfunction
in this illness.Postmortem studies suggest that markers of reduced
GABA neurotransmission in schizophrenia may be selective for, or
at least particularly prominent in, the subclass of GABA neurons,
chandelier cells, that provide inhibitory input to the axon initial
segment of populations of pyramidal neurons. Given the critical role
that chandelier cells play in synchronizing the activity of pyramidal
neurons, the pharmacological amelioration of this deficit may be
particularly effective in normalizing the neural network activity
required for working memory function. Because GABA(A) receptors containing
the a(2) subunit are selectively localized to the axon initial segment
of pyramidal cells, and appear to be markedly up-regulated in schizophrenia,
treatment with novel benzodiazepine-like agents with selective activity
at GABA(A) receptors containing the a(2) subunit may be effective
adjuvant agents for improving working memory function in schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Despite its long history of use and abuse in human culture, the molecular
basis for alcohol action in the brain is poorly understood. The recent
determination of the atomic-scale structure of GLIC, a prokaryotic
member of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC) family,
provides a unique opportunity to characterize the structural basis
for modulation of these channels, many of which are alcohol targets
in brain. We observed that GLIC recapitulates bimodal modulation
by n-alcohols, similar to some eukaryotic pLGICs: methanol and ethanol
weakly potentiated proton-activated currents in GLIC, whereas n-alcohols
larger than ethanol inhibited them. Mapping of residues important
to alcohol modulation of ionotropic receptors for glycine, ?-aminobutyric
acid, and acetylcholine onto GLIC revealed their proximity to transmembrane
cavities that may accommodate one or more alcohol molecules. Site-directed
mutations in the pore-lining M2 helix allowed the identification
of four residues that influence alcohol potentiation, with the direction
of their effects reflecting ?-helical structure. At one of the potentiation-enhancing
residues, decreased side chain volume converted GLIC into a highly
ethanol-sensitive channel, comparable to its eukaryotic relatives.
Covalent labeling of M2 positions with an alcohol analog, a methanethiosulfonate
reagent, further implicated residues at the extracellular end of
the helix in alcohol binding. Molecular dynamics simulations elucidated
the structural consequences of a potentiation-enhancing mutation
and suggested a structural mechanism for alcohol potentiation via
interaction with a transmembrane cavity previously termed the "linking
tunnel." These results provide a unique structural model for independent
potentiating and inhibitory interactions of n-alcohols with a pLGIC
family member.},

computational predictions, there is limited experimental data available

a four-helix bundle in the absence of the extracellular and intracellular
domains. The structure exhibited many similarities to those previously
determined for the Torpedo nAChR and the bacterial ion channel GLIC.
We also assessed the influence of the fourth transmembrane helix

tertiary arrangements were similar, the addition of TM4 caused dramatic
changes in TM3 dynamics and subtle changes in TM1 and TM2. Taken
together, this study suggests that the structures of the transmembrane

abstract = {Like all other monomeric or multimeric transmembrane proteins, receptors
for neurotransmitters are surrounded by a shell of lipids which form
an interfacial boundary between the protein and the bulk membrane.
Among these lipids, cholesterol and sphingolipids have attracted
much attention because of their well-known propensity to segregate
into ordered platform domains commonly referred to as lipid rafts.
In this review we present a critical analysis of the molecular mechanisms
involved in the interaction of cholesterol/sphingolipids with neurotransmitter
receptors, in particular acetylcholine and serotonin receptors, chosen
as representative members of ligand-gated ion channels and G protein-coupled
receptors. Cholesterol and sphingolipids interact with these receptors
through typical binding sites located in both the transmembrane helices
and the extracellular loops. By altering the conformation of the
receptors ("chaperone-like" effect), these lipids can regulate neurotransmitter
binding, signal transducing functions, and, in the case of multimeric
receptors, subunit assembly and subsequent receptor trafficking to
the cell surface. Several sphingolipids (especially gangliosides)
also exhibit low/moderate affinity for neurotransmitters. We suggest
that such lipids could facilitate (i) the attachment of neurotransmitters
to the post-synaptic membrane and in some cases (ii) their subsequent
delivery to specific protein receptors. Overall, various experimental
approaches provide converging evidence that the biological functions
of neurotransmitters and their receptors are highly dependent upon
sphingolipids and cholesterol, which are active partners of synaptic
transmission. Several decades of research have been necessary to
untangle the skein of a complex network of molecular interactions
between neurotransmitters, their receptors, cholesterol and sphingolipids.
This sophisticated crosstalk between all four distinctive partners
may allow a fine biochemical tuning of synaptic transmission.},

that the receptor in phosphatidylcholine alone is stabilized in a

a relatively tight packing of the lipid head groups and thus a well
ordered membrane. Functional reconstituted membranes also exhibit
gel-to-liquid crystal phase transition temperatures that are higher

lateral packing densities and the gel-to-liquid crystal phase transition
temperatures of the reconstituted lipid bilayers. These results suggest
a functional link between the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and

of at least one aromatic residue in the ligand-binding boxes of almost
all representatives of the superfamily. Investigation of the domain
architectures of the bacterial forms shows that they may often show
fusions with other small-molecule-binding domains, such as the periplasmic
binding protein superfamily I (PBP-I), Cache and MCP-N domains. Some
of the bacterial forms also occur in predicted operons with the genes
of the PBP-II superfamily and the Cache domains. Analysis of phyletic
patterns suggests that the ART-LGICs are currently absent in all
other eukaryotic lineages except animals. Moreover, phylogenetic
analysis and conserved sequence motifs also suggest that a subset
of the bacterial forms is closer to the metazoan forms.From the information
from the bacterial forms we infer that cation-pi or hydrophobic interactions
with the ligand are likely to be a pervasive feature of the entire
superfamily, even though the individual residues involved in the
process may vary. The conservation pattern in the channel-forming
transmembrane domains also suggests similar channel-gating mechanisms
in the prokaryotic versions. From the distribution of charged residues
in the prokaryotic M2 transmembrane segments, we expect that there
will be examples of both cation and anion selectivity within the
prokaryotic members. Contextual connections suggest that the prokaryotic
forms may function as chemotactic receptors for low molecular weight
solutes. The phyletic patterns and phylogenetic relationships suggest
the possibility that the metazoan receptors emerged through an early
lateral transfer from a prokaryotic source, before the divergence
of extant metazoan lineages.},

The gamma2 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor is involved in both phasic and tonic signaling in the hippocampus. Several mutations of this subunit are linked to human epileptic syndromes with febrile seizures, yet it is not clear how they perturb neuronal activity. Here, we examined the expression and functional impact of recombinant gamma2 in hippocampal neurons. We show that the K289M mutation has no effect on membrane trafficking and synaptic aggregation of recombinant gamma2, but accelerates the decay of synaptic currents. In contrast, the R43Q mutation primarily reduces surface expression of recombinant gamma2. However, it has no dominant effect on synaptic currents but instead reduces tonic GABA currents, at least in part by reducing surface expression of the alpha5 subunit. Our data suggests that the phenotypic specificity of mutations affecting the GABA(A) receptor gamma2 gene may result from different actions specific to distinct modes of GABAergic signaling.},

abstract = {The activities of integral membrane proteins are often affected by
the structures of the lipid molecules that surround them in the membrane.
One important parameter is the hydrophobic thickness of the lipid
bilayer, defined by the lengths of the lipid fatty acyl chains. Membrane
proteins are not rigid entities, and deform to ensure good hydrophobic
matching to the surrounding lipid bilayer. The structure of the lipid
headgroup region is likely to be important in defining the structures
of those parts of a membrane protein that are located in the lipid
headgroup region. A number of examples are given where the conformation
of the headgroup-embedded region of a membrane protein changes during
the reaction cycle of the protein; activities of such proteins might
be expected to be particularly sensitive to lipid headgroup structure.
Differences in hydrogen bonding potential and hydration between the
headgroups of phosphatidycholines and phosphatidylethanolamines could
be important factors in determining the effects of these lipids on
protein activities, as well as any effects related to the tendency
of the phosphatidylethanolamines to form a curved, hexagonal H(II)
phase. Effects of lipid structure on protein aggregation and helix-helix
interactions are also discussed, as well as the effects of charged
lipids on ion concentrations close to the surface of the bilayer.
Interpretations of lipid effects in terms of changes in protein volume,
lipid free volume, and curvature frustration are also described.
Finally, the role of non-annular, or 'co-factor' lipids, tightly
bound to membrane proteins, is described.},

abstract = {1. The influence of membrane cholesterol on some pharmacological properties
of the GABA(A) receptor was investigated in acutely dissociated rat
hippocampal neurones with whole cell patch clamp recording. The cholesterol
levels were varied between 56{\%} and 235{\%} control using methyl-beta-cyclodextrin
as the cholesterol carrier. 2. Enrichment of neurones with cholesterol
increased the effects of the non-steroidal GABA potentiators propofol,
flunitrazepam and pentobarbitone. A similar result was obtained after
pre-incubation of neurones with epicholesterol, the 3alpha-hydroxy
isomer of cholesterol. 3. In contrast, the effects of the steroidal
GABA potentiators pregnanolone and alfaxalone were reduced by cholesterol
enrichment, but not by epicholesterol. Depletion of membrane cholesterol
increased the potentiation of GABA by pregnanolone and alfaxalone
but did not affect the non-steroidal potentiators. 4. The steroidal
antagonist of GABA, pregnenolone sulphate, reduced the maximum response
to GABA. This effect, also, was diminished in cholesterol-enriched
neurones and enhanced in cholesterol-depleted neurones. 5. The effects
of the cholesterol manipulations that were selective for the steroidal
modulators of GABA are suggested to arise from direct interactions
between membrane cholesterol and the GABA(A) receptor. The separate
effects on the non-steroidal potentiators of GABA of cholesterol-enrichment
or addition of epicholesterol to the neurones are suggested to be
due to changes in membrane fluidity. 6. In view of the likely physiological
modulation of GABA(A) receptors by endogenous neuroactive steroids
and evidence of the in vivo lability of membrane cholesterol, the
present observations may have physiological as well as pharmacological
relevance.},

abstract = {Protein-lipid interactions were studied by using Torpedo californica acetylcholine receptor (AChR) as a model system by reconstituting purified AChR into membranes containing various synthetic lipids and native lipids. AChR function was determined by measuring two activities at 4 degrees C: (1) low to high agonist affinity-state transition of AChR in the presence of an agonist (carbamylcholine) in either membrane fragments or sealed vesicles and (2) ion-gating activity of AChR-containing vesicles in response to carbamylcholine. Sixteen samples were examined, each containing different lipid compositions including phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylethanolamine, asolectin, neutral lipid depleted asolectin, native lipids, and cholesterol-depleted native lipids. Phosphatidylcholines with different configurations of fatty acyl chains were used. The dynamic structures of these membranes were probed by incorporating spin-labeled fatty acid into AChR-containing vesicles and measuring the order parameters. It was found that both aspects of AChR function were highly dependent on the lipid environment even though carbamylcholine binding itself was not affected. An appropriate membrane fluidity was necessarily required to allow the interconversion between the low and high affinity states of AChR. An optimal fluidity hypothesis is proposed to account for the conformational transition properties of membrane proteins. In addition, the conformational change was only a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the AChR-mediated ion flux activity. Among membranes in which AChR manifested the affinity-state transition, only those containing both cholesterol and negatively charged phospholipids (such as phosphatidic acid) retained the ion-gating activity.},

Reference data is obtained from tabulated thermodynamic properties

Intermolecular interactions of the model are further probed through
simulations of the binding of isoflurane to a binding site in horse

with crystallographic data, and the calculated binding affinities
are compatible with experimental results, although both computational

abstract = {Membrane fragments rich in cholinergic (nicotinic) receptor protein
were purified from the electric organ of Torpedo marmorata. Their
lipid composition is essentially characterized by the prominence
of cholesterol, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine,
long-chain fatty acyl constituents, and the absence of sphingomyelin.
Solubilised receptor was purified from these fragments and the concentration
of sodium cholate lowered by dialysis to 0.01{\%} (w/v). When this
preparation was injected under a lipid monolayer, an increase of
surface pressure developed, which was not observed with the detergent
alone nor in the absence of lipid film. When covalently radiolabelled
receptor preparations were injected at a constant surface pressure
the radioactivity recovered with the film was proportional to the
increase in area. It is concluded that the pressure or area increases
are due to the penetration of the cholinergic receptor protein into
the lipid film. Incorporation experiments into films formed from
various pure lipids showed that the protein interacts more readily
with cholesterol than with ergosterol, phosphatidylcholine, or other
phospholipids. Its affinity is also higher for long-chain phosphatidylcholines
than for short-chain ones. The degree of unsaturation and fluidity
of the 3-sn-phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) films are of secondary
importance. Parallel experiments with covalently and non-covalently
labelled receptor preparations showed that part of the protein recovered
with the film lost its alpha-toxin binding ability during the penetration.

abstract = {The major type of receptor for the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric
acid (GABA), called the GABAA receptor, is a member of a gene superfamily
of ligand-gated ion channels. This receptor is a hetero-oligomeric
protein composed of several distinct polypeptide types (alpha, beta,
gamma, and delta). Molecular cloning of these polypeptides reveals
that they show 20-40{\%} identity with each other, and 10-20{\%} identity
with polypeptides of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and strychnine-sensitive
glycine receptor. Each polypeptide type is also represented by a
family of genes whose members have 60-80{\%} amino acid sequence identity.
Regions of conserved and variable amino acid sequence suggest structural
and functional domains within each polypeptide. All of the polypeptides
when expressed in heterologous cells produce GABA-activated chloride
channels, and the different subtypes express different pharmacological
properties. The distributions of mRNAs for the different GABAA receptor
polypeptides and their subtypes show significant brain regional variation
consistent with pharmacological and biochemical evidence for receptor
heterogeneity. Subpopulations of GABAA receptors with different cellular
and regional locations show differential sensitivity to GABA, to
modulators like steroids, to physiological regulation, to disease
processes, and to pharmacological manipulation by drugs such as benzodiazepines.
The properties of the different subpopulations of GABAA receptors
are determined by which one or more of the different polypeptides
and their subtypes are expressed in a given cell to produce a variety
of different oligomeric protein structures. Molecular cloning techniques
have produced rapid advances in understanding the GABAA receptor
protein family.},

nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), that includes the extracellular

of: 1), the x-ray crystal structure of the snail acetylcholine binding
protein, an homolog of the extracellular domain of nAChRs; and 2),
cryo-electron microscopy data of the membrane domain collected on
Torpedo marmorata nAChRs. We performed normal mode analysis on the
complete three-dimensional model to explore protein flexibility.
Among the first 10 lowest frequency modes, only the first mode produces
a structural reorganization compatible with channel gating: a wide
opening of the channel pore caused by a concerted symmetrical quaternary
twist motion of the protein with opposing rotations of the upper
(extracellular) and lower (transmembrane) domains. Still, significant
reorganizations are observed within each subunit, that involve their
bending at the domain interface, an increase of angle between the
two beta-sheets composing the extracellular domain, the internal
beta-sheet being significantly correlated to the movement of the
M2 alpha-helical segment. This global symmetrical twist motion of
the pentameric protein complex, which resembles the opening transition
of other multimeric ion channels, reasonably accounts for the available
experimental data and thus likely describes the nAChR gating process.},

the range 56-250{\%} control by incubation with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin
for depletion and a complex of cholesterol and methyl-beta-cyclodextrin
for enrichment. Manipulation over a narrower range was achieved with
cholesterol + phosphatidylcholine liposomes. A complex of epicholesterol

enrichment reduced the potency of GABA, as did cholesterol depletion,
with increases in EC(50) of up to 4-fold. Cholesterol enrichment
reduced the potency of the competitive antagonist bicuculline but
did not affect that of the non-competitive antagonist picrotoxinin.
Cholesterol depletion did not affect the potencies of either antagonist.
Epicholesterol substituted functionally for cholesterol with respect
to the effects of enrichment. In cholesterol-depleted neurones, however,
only incubation with cholesterol was able to restore GABA potency
to normal. These results suggest a specific requirement for cholesterol
at control levels to maintain optimal GABA potency, which may involve
specific binding of cholesterol to the GABA(A) receptor. The reduction
in GABA potency by enrichment with cholesterol or epicholesterol
is more likely to be due to reduced plasma membrane fluidity.},

abstract = {The four-alpha-helix bundle mimics the transmembrane domain of the
Cys-loop receptor family believed to be the protein target for general
anesthetics. Using high resolution NMR, we solved the structure (Protein
Data Bank ID: 2I7U) of a prototypical dimeric four-alpha-helix bundle,
(Aalpha(2)-L1M/L38M)(2,) with designed specific binding pockets for
volatile anesthetics. Two monomers of the helix-turn-helix motif
form an antiparallel dimer as originally designed, but the high-resolution
structure exhibits an asymmetric quaternary arrangement of the four
helices. The two helices from the N-terminus to the linker (helices
1 and 1') are associated with each other in the dimer by the side-chain
ring stacking of F12 and W15 along the long hydrophobic core and
by a nearly perfect stretch of hydrophobic interactions between the
complementary pairs of L4, L11, L18, and L25, all of which are located
at the heptad e position along the helix-helix dimer interface. In
comparison, the axes of the two helices from the linker to the C-terminus
(helices 2 and 2') are wider apart from each other, creating a lateral
access pathway around K47 from the aqueous phase to the center of
the designed hydrophobic core. The site of the L38M mutation, which
was previously shown to increase the halothane binding affinity by
approximately 3.5-fold, is not part of the hydrophobic core presumably
involved in the anesthetic binding but shows an elevated transverse
relaxation (R(2)) rate. Qualitative analysis of the protein dynamics
by reduced spectral density mapping revealed exchange contributions
to the relaxation at many residues in the helices. This observation
was confirmed by the quantitative analysis using the Modelfree approach
and by the NMR relaxation dispersion measurements. The NMR structures
and Autodock analysis suggest that the pocket with the most favorable
amphipathic property for anesthetic binding is located between the
W15 side chains at the center of the dimeric hydrophobic core, with
the possibility of two additional minor binding sites between the
F12 and F52 ring stacks of each monomer. The high-resolution structure
of the designed anesthetic-binding protein offers unprecedented atomistic
details about possible sites for anesthetic-protein interactions
that are essential to the understanding of molecular mechanisms of
general anesthesia.},

By measuring electrophysiological responses in chimeric alpha7/alpha3 receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes, we have showed the involvement of the M2-M3 loop in coupling agonist binding to the channel gate. An aspartate residue therein, Asp-266 in the alpha7 subunit, was identified by site-directed mutagenesis as crucial, since mutants at this position exhibited very poor functional responses to three different nicotinic agonists. We have extended this investigation to another neuronal nicotinic receptor (alpha3/beta4), and found that a homologous residue in the beta4 subunit, Asp-268, played a similar role in coupling. These findings are consistent with a hypothesis that the aspartate residue in the M2-M3 loop, which is conserved in all homomer-forming alpha-type subunits and all neuronal beta-type subunits that combine to form functional receptors, is a major determinant of information transmission from binding site to channel gate in all neuronal nicotinic receptors.},

currents at synapses via neurotransmitter-dependent activation. These
receptors belong to the ligand-gated ion channel gene superfamily,
in which all members are comprised of five subunits, each of which
possesses a signature 13-residue disulfide loop (Cys loop) in the
extracellular domain. In this study, we used alanine-scanning mutagenesis
of the residues between C138 and C152 of the Cys loop of the glycine
receptor alpha1 subunit to identify residues critical for receptor
activation and allosteric modulation. Mutation of L142, F145, or
P146 to alanine produced decreases in the potency, maximal amplitude,
and Hill coefficient for currents elicited by glycine and impaired
receptor activation by the agonist taurine. These residues, along
with D148, are positionally conserved in the family of LGIC subunits.
Mutation at several other positions had little or no effect. The
inhaled anesthetics halothane and isoflurane potentiate submaximal
agonist responses at wild-type receptors, via an allosteric site.
The mutations L142A, F145A, P146A, and D148A abolished positive modulation
by these anesthetics, in some cases revealing a small inhibitory
effect. A molecular model of the glycine receptor alpha1 subunit
suggests that the Cys loop is positioned in a region of the receptor

the face of a predominantly hydrophobic surface. The present data
implicate the Cys loop as an important functional moiety in the process

abstract = {The effects of lipids on the maintenance of characteristic functional
properties of the acetylcholine receptor during the course of reconstitution
into lipid vesicles were studied by following the kinetics of agonist-induced
state transitions. The requirements for successful preservation of
these properties could be dissected into two components: (a) adequate
nature and concentration of lipids during detergent solubilization;
(b) correct lipid environment during reincorporation into lipid vesicles
by the cholate dialysis procedure. Optimal bulk lipid concentrations
and lipid:cholate ratios for preserving state transitions during
solubilization were studied by using both crude soybean lipids and
pure synthetic phospholipids. The latter class of lipids was found
to be unsuitable substitutes for the crude soybean lipids, irrespective
of their polar head group and/or fatty acyl chain, even when detergent:lipid
ratios as high as 1:1 (w/w) were employed. Addition of cholesteryl
hemisuccinate was able to make up this deficiency, attaining preservation
of acetylcholine receptor state transitions at cholate:steroid ratios
of about 6:1 (w/w). The presence of steroid decreased the amount
of protein solubilized. The correct choice of lipid type was also
essential to the reincorporation step, and higher concentrations
of lipid were required--about 20 mg/mL for soybean lipids. Pure phospholipids
at similar concentrations, however, were unable to maintain the state
transitions. Again, steroid (40-46{\%} cholesteryl hemisuccinate/mol
of total lipid) provided the adequate conditions at the reincorporation
stage and enhanced the amount of protein reincorporated into the
vesicles. A large (70-90{\%}) percentage of the receptor was reincorporated
with the correct vectorial sidedness. No specificity could be detected
for the phospholipid polar head or alkyl chain in relation to any
of these findings. The effect of the protein on the physical state
of the lipids in the reconstituted vesicles was studied by diphenylhexatriene
fluorescence depolarization. The results may be interpreted as a
disordering of the acyl chains in the gel state and an ordering in
the liquid-crystalline state in the presence of protein, accompanied
by shifts in the transition temperatures of the pure phospholipids
to lower values.},

abstract = {Anionic lipids and cholesterols (CHOL) are critical to the function
of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR). We investigated their
interactions with an open- and closed-channel alpha4beta2 nAChR by
over 10 ns molecular dynamics simulations in a ternary lipid mixture
of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl
phosphatidic acid (POPA), and CHOL with a ratio of 3:1:1 (Haddadian
et al., J. Phys. Chem. B 2008, 112, 13981). On average there were
65 and 74 interfacial lipids around the closed- and open-channel
alpha4beta2 nAChR, respectively, in the equilibrated simulation systems.
In the open-channel system, 42{\%} of the interfacial POPA had acyl
chains partially inserted into intra- or intersubunit cavities, as
compared to only 7{\%} in the closed-channel alpha4beta2. No CHOL was
found in cavities within single subunits, though some CHOL infiltrated
into the gaps between subunits. Because of its smaller headgroup,
POPA could access some nonannular sites where POPC could not easily
reach due to steric exclusion. Furthermore, POPA acted not only as
an acceptor for hydrogen bonding (H bonding) as POPC did, but also
as a donor through its hydroxyl group for H bonding with the backbone
of the protein. The charged headgroup of POPA allowed the lipid to
form stable salt bridges with conserved Arg and Lys residues at the
interfaces of the transmembrane (TM) and extracellular (EC) or intracellular
(IC) domains of the alpha4beta2. A higher number of salt bridges
and hydrogen bonds (H bonds) between POPA and the alpha4beta2 nAChR
were found in the open system than in the closed system, suggesting
a potential role of POPA in the equilibrium between different channel
states. Most interfacial POPA molecules showed lower order parameters
than the bulk POPA due to the mixed effect of gauche defects, hydrophobic
mismatch, and the lipid orientations near the magic angle. These
unique properties enable the interfacial POPA to achieve what POPC
cannot with regard to specific interactions with the protein, thereby
making POPA essential for the function of nAChR.},

abstract = {Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) are key players in the
early events of electrical signal transduction at chemical synapses.
The family codes for a structurally conserved scaffold of channel
proteins that open in response to the binding of neurotransmitter
molecules. All proteins share a pentameric organization of identical
or related subunits that consist of an extracellular ligand-binding
domain followed by a transmembrane channel domain. The nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is the most thoroughly studied member
of the pLGIC family (for recent reviews see refs 1-3). Two sources
of structural information provided an architectural framework for
the family. The structure of the soluble acetylcholine-binding protein
(AChBP) defined the organization of the extracellular domain and
revealed the chemical basis of ligand interaction. Electron microscopy
studies of the nAChR from Torpedo electric ray have yielded a picture
of the full-length protein and have recently led to the interpretation
of an electron density map at 4.0 A resolution. Despite the wealth
of experimental information, high-resolution structures of any family
member have so far not been available. Until recently, the pLGICs
were believed to be only expressed in multicellular eukaryotic organisms.
The abundance of prokaryotic genome sequences, however, allowed the
identification of several homologous proteins in bacterial sources.
Here we present the X-ray structure of a prokaryotic pLGIC from the
bacterium Erwinia chrysanthemi (ELIC) at 3.3 A resolution. Our study
reveals the first structure of a pLGIC at high resolution and provides
an important model system for the investigation of the general mechanisms
of ion permeation and gating within the family.},

abstract = {To identify inhalational anesthetic binding domains in a ligand-gated
ion channel, we photolabeled nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR)-rich
membranes from Torpedo electric organ with [(14)C]halothane and determined
by Edman degradation some of the photolabeled amino acids in nAChR
subunit fragments isolated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis and high-performance liquid chromatography. Irradiation
at 254 nm for 60 s in the presence of 1 mM [(14)C]halothane resulted
in incorporation of approximately 0.5 mol of (14)C/mol of subunit,
with photolabeling distributed within the nAChR extracellular and
transmembrane domains, primarily at tyrosines. GammaTyr-111 in ACh
binding site segment E was labeled, while alphaTyr-93 in segment
A was not. Within the transmembrane domain, alphaTyr-213 within alphaM1
and deltaTyr-228 within deltaM1 were photolabeled, while no labeled
amino acids were identified within the deltaM2 ion channel domain.
Although the efficiency of photolabeling at the subunit level was
unaffected by agonist, competitive antagonist, or isoflurane, state-dependent
photolabeling was seen in a delta subunit fragment beginning at deltaPhe-206.
Labeling of deltaTyr-212 in the extracellular domain was inhibited
{\textgreater}90{\%} by d-tubocurarine, whereas addition of either carbamylcholine
or isoflurane had no effect. Within M1, the level of photolabeling
of deltaTyr-228 with [(14)C]halothane was increased by carbamylcholine
(90{\%}) or d-tubocurarine (50{\%}), but it was inhibited by isoflurane
(40{\%}). Within the structure of the nAChR transmembrane domain, deltaTyr-228
projects into an extracellular, water accessible pocket formed by
amino acids from the deltaM1-deltaM3 alpha-helices. Halothane photolabeling
of deltaTyr-228 provides initial evidence that halothane and isoflurane
bind within this pocket with occupancy or access increased in the
nAChR desensitized state compared to the closed channel state. Halothane
binding at this site may contribute to the functional inhibition
of nAChRs.},

abstract = {A variety of experiments suggest that membrane proteins are important
targets of anesthetic molecules, and that ion channels interact differently
with anesthetics in their open and closed conformations. The availability
of an open and a closed structural model for the KirBac1.1 potassium
channel has made it possible to perform a comparative analysis of
the interactions of anesthetics with the same channel in its open
and closed states. To this end, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations
supplemented by normal mode analysis have been employed to probe
the interactions of the inhalational anesthetic halothane with both
an open and closed conformer of KirBac1.1 embedded in a lipid bilayer.
Normal mode analysis on the closed and open channel, in the presence
and absence of halothane, reveals that the anesthetic modulates the
global as well as the local dynamics of both conformations differently.
In the case of the open channel, the observed reduction of flexibility
of residues in the inner helices suggests a functional modification
action of anesthetics on ion channels. In this context, preferential
quenching of the aromatic residue motion and modulation of global
dynamics by halothane may be seen as steps toward potentiating or
favoring open state conformations. These molecular dynamics simulations
provide the first insights into possible specific interactions between
anesthetic molecules and ion channels in different conformations.},

abstract = {The modulatory effect of cholesterol on the function of two structurally
related peptide receptors, the oxytocin receptor and the brain cholecystokinin
receptor in plasma membranes as well as in intact cells, was analyzed.
Different approaches for cholesterol modification were applied: (i)
depletion and reloading of cholesterol mediated by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin
and cholesterol-methyl-beta-cyclodextrin, respectively, in a reversible
manner; (ii) mild treatment of the plasma membranes with cholesterol
oxidase under control of the membrane fluidity as measured by fluorescence
anisotropy of diphenylhexatriene; and (iii) filipin pretreatment
of membranes. The results allowed us to distinguish two mechanisms
of cholesterol affecting the ligand-binding function of receptors:
changes of the membrane fluidity as demonstrated for the cholecystokinin
receptor, or a putatively specific cholesterol-receptor interaction
as shown for the oxytocin receptor. This was confirmed in a structure-activity
analysis with a variety of sterol analogues substituting for cholesterol
in the membranes. While the agonist binding of the cholecystokinin
receptor was supported by each of the tested steroids and was well
correlated with the corresponding fluorescence anisotropy values,
a stringent and unique requirement of the oxytocin receptor's affinity
state for structural features of the sterol molecule was found. The
molecular requirements differ both from those postulated for sterol-phospholipid
interactions and from those known to be necessary for the functional
activity of other proteins. The different behavior of both peptide
receptors concerning the cholesterol dependence of their ligand binding
was also present in vivo at the level of signal transduction. The
results suggest that cholesterol can modulate receptor function by
two distinct mechanisms, by changes of the membrane fluidity, and/or
by a highly specific molecular interaction.},

AChR protein and transmembrane peptides were derivatized with N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide
(PM), purified, and reconstituted into asolectin liposomes. Fluorescence
mapped to proteolytic fragments consistent with PM labeling of cysteine
residues in alphaM1, alphaM4, gammaM1, and gammaM4. The topography
of the pyrene-labeled Cys residues with respect to the membrane and
the apparent affinity for representative lipids were determined by
differential fluorescence quenching with spin-labeled derivatives
of fatty acids, phosphatidylcholine, and the steroids cholestane

selectivity for the whole AChR protein and its transmembrane domains.
In all cases labeled residues were found to lie in a shallow position.
For M4 segments, this is compatible with a linear alpha-helical structure,
but not so for M1, for which "classical" models locate Cys residues
at the center of the hydrophobic stretch. The transmembrane topography
of M1 can be rationalized on the basis of the presence of a substantial
amount of non-helical structure, and/or of kinks attributable to
the occurrence of the evolutionarily conserved proline residues.
The latter is a striking feature of M1 in the AChR and all members

abstract = {The reconstruction of the purified sodium- and chloride-coupled gamma-aminobutyric
acid transporter from rat brain into asolectin liposomes requires
the addition of brain lipids (Radian, R., and Kanner, B. I. (1985)
J. Biol. Chem. 260, 11859-11865). The reconstitution assay was used
to identify the component(s) from brain lipids responsible for the
stimulation during the fractionation of brain lipids. The distribution
of the active component was found to be similar to that of cholesterol.
Furthermore, cholesterol was found to mimic the effect of brain lipids
and it stimulated the transport activity up to 20-fold. Optimal reconstituted
transport activity was achieved with mixtures of cholesterol and
any one of several phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine
or phosphatidylglycerol. gamma-Aminobutyric acid transport in these
liposomes of defined composition exhibited all the properties of
the native transporter, such as the absolute dependence on sodium
and chloride and electrogenicity. Cholesterol could not be replaced
by cholest-4-en-3one and other steroids, and thus its effect is probably
not due to effects on membrane fluidity. The requirement was also
not due to effects on intactness of the liposomes or incorporation
of proteins into them. Furthermore it was found that the reconstitution
of the sodium and potassium coupled L-glutamic acid transporter from
rat brain also required cholesterol. However, in this case the optimal
activity was reached by 4-5-fold lower levels of cholesterol than
those necessary for gamma-aminobutyric acid transport. When cholesterol
depletion from the transporters was incomplete, addition of exogenous
brain lipids was not required. Thus, if the cholesterol was still
associated with the transporter proteins, its final concentration,
as a fraction of the total lipids present in the reconstitution mixture,
was only about 0.01 mol{\%}. Thus, it is likely that the effects of
cholesterol are due to direct interactions with the cotransporters
and not to an average effect on membrane properties.},

Here, we characterize the GABA binding site in RDL receptors using computational and electrophysiological techniques. A homology model of the extracellular domain of RDL was generated and GABA docked into the binding site. Molecular dynamics simulations predicted critical GABA binding interactions with aromatic residues F206, Y254, and Y109 and hydrophilic residues E204, S176, R111, R166, S176, and T251. These residues were mutated, expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and their functions assessed using electrophysiology. The data support the binding mechanism provided by the simulations, which predict that GABA forms many interactions with binding site residues, the most significant of which are cation-$\pi$ interactions with F206 and Y254, H-bonds with E204, S205, R111, S176, T251, and ionic interactions with R111 and E204. These findings clarify the roles of a range of residues in binding GABA in the RDL receptor, and also show that molecular dynamics simulations are a useful tool to identify specific interactions in Cys-loop receptors.},

out to further characterize lipid-protein interactions involving

microenvironment, cis- and trans-parinaric acids were used to take
advantage of the preferential partitioning behavior of the trans
isomer for the gel phase. A relatively higher extent of energy transfer
from the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of AChR in dielaidoylphosphatidylcholine
bilayers to cis-parinaric acid in both the gel and the fluid phase

of lipids. The ability of AChR to accommodate and interact with specific
lipids such as cholesterol and fatty acids in the vicinity of pyrene-labeled
cysteine residues in the membranous domain and/or the membrane-water
interface region of the gamma subunit was assessed. Pyrene-labeled
AChR prepared in (6,7-dibromostearoyl)phosphatidylcholine showed
a 25{\%} decrease in fluorescence as sites accessible to phospholipids
were occupied; subsequent addition of dibromocholesterol hemisuccinate
(DiBrCHS) caused further quenching by about 25{\%}. This result is
consistent with the presence of sites accessible to cholesterol,
but not accessible to phospholipids, in the vicinity of the cysteine-bound
pyrene in the membranous domain of the AChR. Quenching by DiBrCHS
was sensitive to the presence of an AChR activator (carbamylcholine)

abstract = {We studied the effects of the volatile anesthetic isoflurane on nicotinic
acetylcholine (ACh) receptor channels using a technique for rapid
perfusion of ACh to outside-out patches. Channels were activated
by ACh, at concentrations ranging from 1 microM to 10 mM, and the
macroscopic current flowing through tens or hundreds of channels
was measured. Isoflurane reduced the peak current response to saturating
concentrations of ACh, increased the current decay rate due to desensitization,
and decreased the rate of recovery from desensitization. The effect
of isoflurane on peak currents was concentration dependent; at 2{\%}
isoflurane, the peak current was reduced by half. The effect of isoflurane
on the peak current induced by nonsaturating concentrations of ACh
was smaller. We measured the onset and recovery of current inhibition
by isoflurane, by rapidly applying and removing isoflurane to the
patch within 100 microseconds. 2{\%} isoflurane, currents were inhibited
with a time constant of 200-300 microseconds and recovered with a
time constant of 500-700 microseconds. We interpreted our results
in terms of a kinetic model in which isoflurane binds directly to
both open and closed channels (not necessarily within the pore of
the channel) and stops the flow of ions through open channels. This
model provides a quantitative explanation for the kinetic and equilibrium
effects of isoflurane on peak currents activated by saturating concentrations
of ACh. Our data support the idea that the flickering effect of isoflurane
on single ACh receptor channels is caused by rapid binding and dissociation
of isoflurane to an inhibitory binding site on the protein. The effects
of isoflurane on the apparent affinity of ACh and on desensitization
are not predicted by the model. These effects may arise from the
binding of isoflurane to other sites, not necessarily on the protein
itself.},

of type A gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) neurotransmitter receptors.
Given this role, it is therefore important to understand how these
receptors are regulated by endogenous modulators in the brain and
determine where they bind to the receptor. One of the most potent
groups of modulators is the neurosteroids which regulate the activity
of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors. This level of regulation
is thought to be physiologically important and its dysfunction may
be relevant to numerous neurological conditions. The aim of this
review is to summarise those studies that over the last 20 years
have focussed upon finding the binding sites for neurosteroids on
GABA(A) receptors. We consider the nature of steroid binding sites
in other proteins where this has been determined at atomic resolution
and how their generic features were mapped onto GABA(A) receptors
to help locate 2 putative steroid binding sites. Altogether, the
findings strongly suggest that neurosteroids do bind to discrete
sites on the GABA(A) receptor and that these are located within the
transmembrane domains of alpha and beta receptor subunits. The implications
for neurosteroid binding to other inhibitory receptors such as glycine
and GABA(C) receptors are also considered. Identifying neurosteroid
binding sites may enable the precise pathophysiological role(s) of
neurosteroids in the CNS to be established for the first time, as
well as providing opportunities for the design of novel drug entities.},

Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+), benign familial neonatal convulsions and nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, three autosomal dominant idiopathic epilepsies, result from mutations affecting voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, respectively. Disruption of GABAergic neurotransmission mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) has been implicated in epilepsy for many decades. We now report a K289M mutation in the GABA(A) receptor gamma2-subunit gene (GABRG2) that segregates in a family with a phenotype closely related to GEFS+ (ref. 8), an autosomal dominant disorder associating febrile seizures and generalized epilepsy previously linked to mutations in sodium channel genes. The K289M mutation affects a highly conserved residue located in the extracellular loop between transmembrane segments M2 and M3. Analysis of the mutated and wild-type alleles in Xenopus laevis oocytes confirmed the predicted effect of the mutation, a decrease in the amplitude of GABA-activated currents. We thus provide the first genetic evidence that a GABA(A) receptor is directly involved in human idiopathic epilepsy.},

calculations have emerged as a powerful tool that can play a predictive

and nonequilibrium work methods are discussed, demonstrating that
at little to no additional cost, free-energy estimates could be markedly
improved and bounded by meaningful error estimates. Monitoring the
probability distributions that underlie the transformation between

stratifying the reaction pathway, and choosing the most appropriate

abstract = {The photoactivatable sterol probe [3alpha-(3)H]6-Azi-5alpha-cholestan-3beta-ol
([3H]Azicholesterol) was used to identify domains in the Torpedo
californica nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) that interact
with cholesterol. [3H]Azicholesterol partitioned into nAChR-enriched
membranes very efficiently ({\textgreater}98{\%}), photoincorporated into nAChR
subunits on an equal molar basis, and neither the pattern nor the
extent of labeling was affected by the presence of the agonist carbamylcholine,
consistent with photoincorporation at the nAChR lipid-protein interface.
Sites of [3H]Azicholesterol incorporation in each nAChR subunit were
initially mapped by Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease digestion to
two relatively large homologous fragments that contain either the
transmembrane segments M1-M2-M3 (e.g., alphaV8-20) or M4 (e.g., alphaV8-10).
The distribution of [3H]Azicholesterol labeling between these two
fragments (e.g., alphaV8-20, 29{\%}; alphaV8-10, 71{\%}), suggests that
the M4 segment has the greatest interaction with membrane cholesterol.
Photolabeled amino acid residues in each M4 segment were identified
by Edman degradation of isolated tryptic fragments and generally
correspond to acidic residues located at either end of each transmembrane
helix (e.g., alphaAsp-407). [3H]Azicholesterol labeling was also
mapped to peptides that contain either the M3 or M1 segment of each
nAChR subunit. These results establish that cholesterol likely interacts
with the M4, M3, and M1 segments of each subunit, and therefore,
the cholesterol binding domain fully overlaps the lipid-protein interface
of the nAChR.},

(nAcChoR) fails completely in the absence of cholesterol is unknown.
Affinity-purified nAcChoRs from Torpedo reconstituted into 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine/1,
2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate/steroid bilayers at mole ratios
of 58:12:30 were used to distinguish between three regions of the
membrane where cholesterol might act: the lipid bilayer, the lipid-protein
interface, or sites within the protein itself. In the bilayer, the
role of fluidity has been ruled out and certain neutral lipids can
substitute for cholesterol [C. Sunshine, M.G. McNamee, Biochim. Biophys.
Acta 1191 (1994) 59-64]; therefore, we first tested the hypothesis
that flip-flop of cholesterol across the membrane is important; a
plausible mechanism might be the relief of mechanical bending strain
induced by a conformation change that expands the two leaflets of
the bilayer asymmetrically. Cholesterol analogs prevented from flipping
by charged groups attached to the 3-position's hydroxyl supported
channel opening, contrary to this hypothesis. The second hypothesis
is that interstitial cholesterol binding sites exist deep within
the nAcChoR that must be occupied for channel opening to occur. When
cholesterol hemisuccinate was covalently 'tethered' to the glycerol
backbone of phosphatidylcholine, channel opening was still supported.
Thus, if there are functionally important cholesterol sites, they
must be very close to the lipid-protein interface and might be termed
periannular.},

abstract = {When nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are reconstituted into lipid
bilayers lacking cholesterol, agonists no longer stimulate cation
flux. The kinetics of this process are difficult to study because
variations in vesicle morphology cause errors in flux measurements.
We developed a new stopped-flow fluorescence assay to study activation
independently of vesicle morphology. When receptors were rapidly
mixed with agonist plus ethidium, the earliest fluorescence increase
reported the fraction of channels that opened and their apparent
rate of fast desensitization. These processes were absent when the
receptor was reconstituted into dioleoylphosphatidylcholine or into
a mixture of that lipid with dioleoylphosphatidic acid (12 mol{\%}),
even though a fluorescent agonist reported that resting-state receptors
were still present. The agonist-induced channel opening probability
increased with bilayer cholesterol, with a midpoint value of 9 +/-
1.7 mol{\%} and a Hill coefficient of 1.9 +/- 0.69, reaching a plateau
above 20-30 mol{\%} cholesterol that was equal to the native value.
On the other hand, the observed fast desensitization rate was comparable
to that for native membranes from the lowest cholesterol concentration
examined (5 mol{\%}). Thus the ability to reach the open state after
activation varies with the cholesterol concentration in the bilayer,
whereas the rate of the open state to fast desensitized state transition
is unaffected. The structural basis for this is unknown, but an interesting
corollary is that the channels of newly synthesized receptors are
not fully primed by cholesterol until they are inserted into the
plasma membrane--a novel form of posttranslational processing.},

abstract = {We have modelled the transmembrane region of the alpha 7 nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor as a mixed alpha-helical/beta-sheet structure.
The model was mainly based on the crystal structure of a pore-forming
toxin, heat-labile enterotoxin. This is a pentameric protein having
a central pore or channel composed of five alpha-helices, one from
each of the 5 B subunits that form this pentamer. The remainder of
this structure is beta-sheet, loops and a short alpha-helix, not
included in the model. The model uses this channel as a template
to build the transmembrane region, from M1 to the middle of M3. The
remainder of M3 and M4 were built de novo as alpha-helices. Great
consideration was given to labelling data available for the transmembrane
region. In general terms, the shape of the model agrees very well
with that obtained independently by electron microscopic analysis
and the secondary structure predicted by the model is in accord with
that estimated independently by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
The M2 helical region of the model is only slightly kinked, contrary
to what is inferred from electron microscopic analysis, but has the
same overall shape and form. On the membrane face of the model, the
presence of deep pockets may provide the structural basis for the
distinction between annular and non-annular lipid binding sites.
Also, the transmembrane region is clearly asymmetric in the direction
perpendicular to the membrane, and this may have strong influence
on the surrounding lipid composition of each leaflet of the cytoplasmic
membrane.},

The ED(50) against pentylenetetrazole-induced tonic seizures ranged
from 0.48 mg/kg (L-676,893) to {\textgreater}160 mg/kg (L-685,869) cf. 0. 26 mg/kg
for diazepam. Although avermectins are without acute toxic effects,
they have been historically shown to have relative low LD(50) values
in mammals. The mechanisms involved in the anticonvulsant effect
and the toxicity were investigated. A series of avermectin analogs
displaced [(3)H]ivermectin binding to rat brain membranes and recombinant
GABA(A) receptors (alpha1beta3gamma2-subtype) with the same affinities,
strongly suggesting that [(3)H]ivermectin labels the GABA(A) receptor
in rodent brain. Avermectins, which were anticonvulsant, were also
potent inhibitors of [(3)H]ivermectin binding in rat brain. However,
the rank order for anticonvulsant activity did not parallel the rank
order for affinity at the [(3)H]ivermectin site and it was reasoned
that avermectins may have differential affinity or efficacy at subtypes
of the GABA(A) receptor. All the active compounds tested potentiated
the effects of GABA at recombinant GABA(A) receptors in oocytes and
at native cortical GABA(A) receptors and the efficacy of avermectins
at the GABA(A) receptor correlated best with their anticonvulsant
potency. Although avermectins weakly inhibited [(3)H]strychnine binding
in rat spinal cord, and inhibited glycine responses on primary cultured
cortical neurons, activity at glycine receptors did not correlate
with either anticonvulsant activity or toxicity. Because both anticonvulsant
activity and toxicity correlated best with activity at GABA(A) receptors,
it is unlikely that these effects can be separated, which may contraindicate
the potential use of avermectins as anticonvulsants.},

simulation and analyses of root mean-square fluctuations, block partitioning

The most relevant motions comprise a bending, hinged at the beta10-M1
region, accompanied by concerted tilting of the M2 helices that widens
the intracellular end of the channel. Despite the nanosecond timescale,
the observations suggest that tilting of the M2 helices may initiate
opening of the pore. The results also reveal direct coupling between
a twisting motion of the extracellular domain and dynamic changes
of M2. Covariance analysis of interresidue motions shows that this
coupling arises through a network of residues within the Cys and
M2-M3 loops where Phe135 is stabilized within a hydrophobic pocket
formed by Leu270 and Ile271. The resulting concerted motion causes
a downward shift of the M2 helices that disrupts a hydrophobic girdle

abstract = {We have developed a homology model of the GABA(A) receptor, using the subunit combination of alpha1beta2gamma2, the most prevalent type in the mammalian brain. The model is produced in two parts: the membrane-embedded channel domain and the extracellular N-terminal domain. The pentameric transmembrane domain model is built by modeling each subunit by homology with the equivalent subunit of the heteropentameric acetylcholine receptor transmembrane domain. This segment is then joined with the extracellular domain built by homology with the acetylcholine binding protein. The all-atom model forms a wide extracellular vestibule that is connected to an oval chamber near the external surface of the membrane. A narrow, cylindrical transmembrane channel links the outer segment of the pore to a shallow intracellular vestibule. The physiological properties of the model so constructed are examined using electrostatic calculations and Brownian dynamics simulations. A deep energy well of approximately 80 kT accommodates three Cl(-) ions in the narrow transmembrane channel and seven Cl(-) ions in the external vestibule. Inward permeation takes place when one of the ions queued in the external vestibule enters the narrow segment and ejects the innermost ion. The model, when incorporated into Brownian dynamics, reproduces key experimental features, such as the single-channel current-voltage-concentration profiles. Finally, we simulate the gamma2 K289M epilepsy inducing mutation and examine Cl(-) ion permeation through the mutant receptor.},

abstract = {General anaesthetics have enjoyed long and widespread use but their
molecular mechanism of action remains poorly understood. There is
good evidence that their principal targets are pentameric ligand-gated
ion channels (pLGICs) such as inhibitory GABA(A) (?-aminobutyric
acid) receptors and excitatory nicotinic acetylcholine receptors,
which are respectively potentiated and inhibited by general anaesthetics.
The bacterial homologue from Gloeobacter violaceus (GLIC), whose
X-ray structure was recently solved, is also sensitive to clinical
concentrations of general anaesthetics. Here we describe the crystal
structures of the complexes propofol/GLIC and desflurane/GLIC. These
reveal a common general-anaesthetic binding site, which pre-exists
in the apo-structure in the upper part of the transmembrane domain
of each protomer. Both molecules establish van der Waals interactions
with the protein; propofol binds at the entrance of the cavity whereas
the smaller, more flexible, desflurane binds deeper inside. Mutations
of some amino acids lining the binding site profoundly alter the
ionic response of GLIC to protons, and affect its general-anaesthetic
pharmacology. Molecular dynamics simulations, performed on the wild
type (WT) and two GLIC mutants, highlight differences in mobility
of propofol in its binding site and help to explain these effects.
These data provide a novel structural framework for the design of
general anaesthetics and of allosteric modulators of brain pLGICs.},

abstract = {The GABA(A) receptor $\gamma$2 subunit nonsense mutation Q351X has been associated with the genetic epilepsy syndrome generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus, which includes a spectrum of seizures types from febrile seizures to Dravet syndrome. Although most genetic epilepsy syndromes are mild and remit with age, Dravet syndrome has a more severe clinical course with refractory seizures associated with developmental delay and cognitive impairment. The basis for the broad spectrum of seizure phenotypes is uncertain. We demonstrated previously that the GABA(A) receptor $\gamma$2 subunit gene Q351X mutation suppressed biogenesis of wild-type partnering $\alpha$1 and $\beta$2 subunits in addition to its loss of function. Here we show that $\gamma$2S(Q351X) subunits have an additional impairment of biogenesis. Mutant $\gamma$2(Q351X) subunits were degraded more slowly than wild-type $\gamma$2 subunits and formed SDS-resistant, high-molecular-mass complexes or aggregates in multiple cell types, including neurons. The half-life of $\gamma$2S(Q351X) subunits was ∼4 h, whereas that of $\gamma$2S subunits was ∼2 h. Mutant subunits formed complexes rapidly after synthesis onset. Using multiple truncated subunits, we demonstrated that aggregate formation was a general phenomenon for truncated $\gamma$2S subunits and that their Cys-loop cysteines were involved in aggregate formation. Protein aggregation is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, but the effects of the mutant $\gamma$2S(Q351X) subunit aggregates on neuronal function and survival are unclear. Additional validation of the mutant subunit aggregation in vivo and determination of the involved signaling pathways will help reveal the pathological effects of these mutant subunit aggregates in the pathogenesis of genetic epilepsy syndromes.},

the X-ray structure at 2.9 A resolution of the bacterial Gloeobacter
violaceus pentameric ligand-gated ion channel homologue (GLIC) at
pH 4.6 in an apparently open conformation. This cationic channel
is known to be permanently activated by protons. The structure is
arranged as a funnel-shaped transmembrane pore widely open on the
outer side and lined by hydrophobic residues. On the inner side,
a 5 A constriction matches with rings of hydrophilic residues that
are likely to contribute to the ionic selectivity. Structural comparison
with ELIC, a bacterial homologue from Erwinia chrysanthemi solved
in a presumed closed conformation, shows a wider pore where the narrow
hydrophobic constriction found in ELIC is removed. Comparative analysis
of GLIC and ELIC reveals, in concert, a rotation of each extracellular
beta-sandwich domain as a rigid body, interface rearrangements, and
a reorganization of the transmembrane domain, involving a tilt of
the M2 and M3 alpha-helices away from the pore axis. These data are
consistent with a model of pore opening based on both quaternary

abstract = {Molecular mechanics models have been applied extensively to study
the dynamics of proteins and nucleic acids. Here we report the development
of a third-generation point-charge all-atom force field for proteins.
Following the earlier approach of Cornell et al., the charge set
was obtained by fitting to the electrostatic potentials of dipeptides
calculated using B3LYP/cc-pVTZ//HF/6-31G** quantum mechanical methods.
The main-chain torsion parameters were obtained by fitting to the
energy profiles of Ace-Ala-Nme and Ace-Gly-Nme di-peptides calculated
using MP2/cc-pVTZ//HF/6-31G** quantum mechanical methods. All other
parameters were taken from the existing AMBER data base. The major
departure from previous force fields is that all quantum mechanical
calculations were done in the condensed phase with continuum solvent
models and an effective dielectric constant of epsilon = 4. We anticipate
that this force field parameter set will address certain critical
short comings of previous force fields in condensed-phase simulations
of proteins. Initial tests on peptides demonstrated a high-degree
of similarity between the calculated and the statistically measured
Ramanchandran maps for both Ace-Gly-Nme and Ace-Ala-Nme di-peptides.
Some highlights of our results include (1) well-preserved balance
between the extended and helical region distributions, and (2) favorable
type-II poly-proline helical region in agreement with recent experiments.
Backward compatibility between the new and Cornell et al. charge
sets, as judged by overall agreement between dipole moments, allows
a smooth transition to the new force field in the area of ligand-binding
calculations. Test simulations on a large set of proteins are also
discussed.},

an affinity to water also is essential. It was recently found that
compounds with very low affinities to water do not produce anesthesia

anesthesia might arise because of interactions at molecular sites
near the interface of neuronal membranes with the aqueous environment
and, therefore, might require increased concentrations of anesthetic
molecules at membrane interfaces. As an initial test of this hypothesis,
we calculated in molecular dynamics simulations the free energy profiles
for the transfer of anesthetic 1,1,2-trifluoroethane and nonanesthetic
perfluoroethane across water-membrane and water-hexane interfaces.
Consistent with the hypothesis, it was found that trifluoroethane,
but not perfluoroethane, exhibits a free energy minimum and, therefore,
increased concentrations at both interfaces. The transfer of trifluoroethane
from water to the nonpolar hexane or interior of the membrane is
accompanied by a considerable, solvent-induced shift in the conformational
equilibrium around the C-C bond.},

GABA(A) receptor by the neurotransmitter GABA plays a crucial role
in controlling neuronal excitability. This essential form of neuronal
regulation may be subject to "fine tuning" by particular metabolites

GABA(A) receptor to enhance the actions of GABA. Originally such
steroids were considered to act as endocrine messengers, being synthesised
in peripheral glands such as the adrenals and ovaries and crossing
the blood brain barrier to influence neuronal signalling. However,
it is now evident that certain neurons and glia may produce such
"neurosteroids" and that these locally synthesised modulators may
act in a paracrine, or indeed an autocrine manner to influence neuronal
activity. Neurosteroid synthesis may change dynamically in a variety
of physiological situations (e.g. stress, pregnancy) and perturbations
in their levels are implicated in a variety of neurological and psychiatric
disorders. Here we will consider (1) evidence supporting the concept
that neurosteroids act as local regulators of neuronal inhibition,
(2) that extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors appear to be a particularly
important neurosteroid target and (3) recent advances in defining
the neurosteroid binding site(s) on the GABA(A) receptor.},

abstract = {Some neurotransmitter-gated ion channels are very much more sensitive
to general anesthetics than others, even when they are genetically
and structurally related. The most striking example of this is the
extreme sensitivity of heteromeric neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors to inhalational general anesthetics compared with the marked
insensitivity of the closely related homomeric neuronal nicotinic
receptors. Here we investigate the role of the alpha subunit in determining
the anesthetic sensitivity of these receptors by using alpha(3)/alpha(7)
chimeric subunits that are able to form functional homomeric receptors.
By comparing the sensitivities of a number of chimeras to the inhalational
agent halothane we show that the short (13 amino acids) putative
extracellular loop connecting the second and third transmembrane
segments is a critical determinant of anesthetic sensitivity. In
addition, using site-directed mutagenesis, we show that two particular
amino acids in this loop play a dominant role. When mutations are
made in this loop, there is a good correlation between increasing
anesthetic sensitivity and decreasing acetylcholine sensitivity.
We conclude that this extracellular loop probably does not participate
directly in anesthetic binding, but rather determines receptor sensitivity
indirectly by playing a critical role in transducing anesthetic binding
into an effect on channel gating.},

(15)N solution-state NMR. Both 1-chloro-1,2,2-trifluorocyclobutane
(F3) and isoflurane, two volatile general anesthetics, induced nonuniform
changes in chemical shifts among residues in TM2e. Saturation transfer
difference NMR experiments further confirmed the direct anesthetic
interaction with TM2e. A significant and more specific anesthetic
interaction was observed on three leucine residues at the helix C-terminus.
Although the TM2e helical structure remained after addition of anesthetics,
plausible shortening and lengthening of helix hydrogen bonds were
evidenced by periodic changes in backbone amide chemical shifts.
The TM2e backbone dynamics were determined on the basis of the (15)N

The ATPase activity measured for the ATPase reconstituted with the

of Ca2+ binding to the ATPase is two Ca2+ ions bound per ATPase molecule
in the native membrane or in (C18:1,CHS)PC, but one bound per ATPase
molecule in di(C14:1)PC or (C14: 1,CHS)PC. Addition of cholesterol

remains 1:1 in mixtures of di(C14: 1)PC and (C14:1,CHS)PC. Removal

an increase in fluorescence intensity for the ATPase in di(C14:1)PC

(nAChR) requires the interaction of the protein with distinct lipid
species present in the receptor's membrane microenvironment. Two
classes of lipid binding sites present at the protein-membrane interface
have been postulated: annular binding sites primarily occupied by
phospholipids and non-annular binding sites mainly occupied by cholesterol
[Jones {\&} McNamee (1988) Biochemistry 27, 2364-2374]. We investigated
the binding of these lipids to the nAChR and potential dynamics of
these interactions during events associated with signal transduction
by electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR) using spin-labeled
analogues of phospholipids, androstane, and stearic acid. Protein-lipid
interactions were characterized in receptor-rich membranes prepared
from Torpedo californica electric tissue preserving the native lipid
environment of the nAChR. We found a strong preference of the receptor
for the phosphatidylserine (PS) analogue as compared to the other
probes. Up to 57{\%} of PS were perturbed by the membrane protein,
while the fraction of motionally restricted lipid for the other analogues
was on the order of 30{\%}. After removal of the extramembrane portions
of the membrane-bound receptor, we observed a loss of binding sites
for the spin-labeled analogue of androstane and for stearic acid,
but not for phospholipids and sphingomyelin analogues. Our results
demonstrate the existence of topologically distinct lipid binding
sites for different lipid species. In the case of cholesterol, extramembrane
portions of the receptor are involved, whereas the transmembrane
segments meet the requirements for the binding of phospholipids.
Tyrosine phosphorylation of the nAChR did not affect protein-lipid
interactions in samples of intact nAChR. Similarly, no significant
changes were observed in the presence of carbamoylcholine at concentrations

abstract = {Neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) mediate rapid synaptic transmission by activating receptors belonging to the gene superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs). These channels are pentameric proteins that function as signal transducers, converting chemical messages into electrical signals. Neurotransmitters activate LGICs by interacting with a ligand-binding site, triggering a conformational change in the protein that results in the opening of an ion channel. This process, which is known as 'gating', occurs rapidly and reversibly, but the molecular rearrangements involved are not well understood. Here we show that optimal gating in the GABA(A) receptor, a member of the LGIC superfamily, is dependent on electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged Asp 57 and Asp 149 residues in extracellular loops 2 and 7, and the positively charged Lys 279 residue in the transmembrane 2-3 linker region of the alpha1-subunit. During gating, Asp 149 and Lys 279 seem to move closer to one another, providing a potential mechanism for the coupling of ligand binding to opening of the ion channel.},

abstract = {Cys-loop receptor neurotransmitter-gated ion channels are pentameric
assemblies of subunits that contain three domains: extracellular,
transmembrane, and intracellular. The extracellular domain forms
the agonist binding site. The transmembrane domain forms the ion
channel. The cytoplasmic domain is involved in trafficking, localization,
and modulation by cytoplasmic second messenger systems but its role
in channel assembly and function is poorly understood and little
is known about its structure. The intracellular domain is formed
by the large ({\textgreater}100 residues) loop between the alpha-helical M3 and
M4 transmembrane segments. Putative prokaryotic Cys-loop homologues
lack a large M3M4 loop. We replaced the complete M3M4 loop (115 amino
acids) in the 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3A (5-HT(3A)) subunit with
a heptapeptide from the prokaryotic homologue from Gloeobacter violaceus.
The macroscopic electrophysiological and pharmacological characteristics
of the homomeric 5-HT(3A)-glvM3M4 receptors were comparable to 5-HT(3A)
wild type. The channels remained cation-selective but the 5-HT(3A)-glvM3M4
single channel conductance was 43.5 pS as compared with the subpicosiemens
wild-type conductance. Coexpression of hRIC-3, a protein that modulates
expression of 5-HT(3) and acetylcholine receptors, significantly
attenuated 5-HT-induced currents with wild-type 5-HT(3A) but not
5-HT(3A)-glvM3M4 receptors. A similar deletion of the M3M4 loop in
the anion-selective GABA-rho1 receptor yielded functional, GABA-activated,
anion-selective channels. These results imply that the M3M4 loop
is not essential for receptor assembly and function and suggest that
the cytoplasmic domain may fold as an independent module from the
transmembrane and extracellular domains.},

abstract = {Mutations that impair the expression and/or function of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors can lead to epilepsy. The familial epilepsy gamma2(K289M) mutation affects a basic residue conserved in the TM2-3 linker of most GABAA subunits. We investigated the effect on expression and function of the Lys --{\textgreater} Met mutation in mouse alpha1(K278M), beta2(K274M), and gamma2(K289M) subunits. Compared with cells expressing wild-type and alpha1beta2gamma2(K289M) receptors, cells expressing alpha1(K278M)beta2gamma2 and alpha1beta2(K274M)gamma2 receptors exhibited reduced agonist-evoked current density and reduced GABA potency, with no change in single channel conductance. The low current density of alpha1beta2(K274M)gamma2 receptors coincided with reduced surface expression. By contrast the surface expression of alpha1(K278M)beta2gamma2 receptors was similar to wild-type and alpha1beta2gamma2(K289M) receptors suggesting that the alpha1(K278M) impairs function. In keeping with this interpretation GABA-activated channels mediated by alpha1(K278M)beta2gamma2 receptors had brief open times. To a lesser extent gamma2(K289M) also reduced mean open time, whereas beta2(K274M) had no effect. We used propofol as an alternative GABAA receptor agonist to test whether the functional deficits of mutant subunits were specific to GABA activation. Propofol was less potent as an activator of alpha1(K278M)beta2gamma2 receptors. By contrast, neither beta2(K274M) nor gamma2(K289M) affected the potency of propofol. The beta2(K274M) construct was unique in that it reduced the efficacy of propofol activation relative to GABA. These data suggest that the alpha1 subunit Lys-278 residue plays a pivotal role in channel gating that is not dependent on occupancy of the GABA binding site. Moreover, the conserved TM2-3 loop lysine has an asymmetric function in different GABAA subunits.},

abstract = {Fast inhibitory neurotransmission is essential for nervous system function and is mediated by binding of inhibitory neurotransmitters to receptors of the Cys-loop family embedded in the membranes of neurons. Neurotransmitter binding triggers a conformational change in the receptor, opening an intrinsic chloride channel and thereby dampening neuronal excitability. Here we present the first three-dimensional structure, to our knowledge, of an inhibitory anion-selective Cys-loop receptor, the homopentameric Caenorhabditis elegans glutamate-gated chloride channel $\alpha$ (GluCl), at 3.3 {\AA}resolution. The X-ray structure of the GluCl-Fab complex was determined with the allosteric agonist ivermectin and in additional structures with the endogenous neurotransmitter L-glutamate and the open-channel blocker picrotoxin. Ivermectin, used to treat river blindness, binds in the transmembrane domain of the receptor and stabilizes an open-pore conformation. Glutamate binds in the classical agonist site at subunit interfaces, and picrotoxin directly occludes the pore near its cytosolic base. GluCl provides a framework for understanding mechanisms of fast inhibitory neurotransmission and allosteric modulation of Cys-loop receptors.},

on the protein was limited, but with the production of the x-ray
crystal structure of the Lymnea stagnalis acetylcholine binding protein

ray nicotinic channel, we were provided with a window to examine
the mechanism by which this channel operates. A 15-ns all-atom simulation
of a homology model of the homomeric human alpha7 form of the receptor
was conducted in a solvated palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol-phosphatidylcholine
bilayer and examined in detail. The receptor was unliganded. The
structure undergoes a twist-to-close motion that correlates movements
of the C loop in the ligand binding domain, via the beta10-strand
that connects the two, with the 10 degrees rotation and inward movement
of two nonadjacent subunits. The Cys loop appears to act as a stator
around which the alpha-helical transmembrane domain can pivot and
rotate relative to the rigid beta-sheet binding domain. The M2-M3
loop may have a role in controlling the extent or kinetics of these
relative movements. All of this motion, along with essential dynamics
analysis, is suggestive of the direction of larger motions involved
in gating of the channel.},

abstract = {Cys-loop receptors are molecular targets of general anesthetics, but
the knowledge of anesthetic binding to these proteins remains limited.
Here we investigate anesthetic binding to the bacterial Gloeobacter
violaceus pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC), a structural
homolog of cys-loop receptors, using an experimental and computational
hybrid approach. Tryptophan fluorescence quenching experiments showed
halothane and thiopental binding at three tryptophan-associated sites
in the extracellular (EC) domain, transmembrane (TM) domain, and
EC-TM interface of GLIC. An additional binding site at the EC-TM
interface was predicted by docking analysis and validated by quenching
experiments on the N200W GLIC mutant. The binding affinities (K(D))
of 2.3 ± 0.1 mM and 0.10 ± 0.01 mM were derived from the fluorescence
quenching data of halothane and thiopental, respectively. Docking
these anesthetics to the original GLIC crystal structure and the
structures relaxed by molecular dynamics simulations revealed intrasubunit
sites for most halothane binding and intersubunit sites for thiopental
binding. Tryptophans were within reach of both intra- and intersubunit
binding sites. Multiple molecular dynamics simulations on GLIC in
the presence of halothane at different sites suggested that anesthetic
binding at the EC-TM interface disrupted the critical interactions
for channel gating, altered motion of the TM23 linker, and destabilized
the open-channel conformation that can lead to inhibition of GLIC
channel current. The study has not only provided insights into anesthetic
binding in GLIC, but also demonstrated a successful fusion of experiments
and computations for understanding anesthetic actions in complex
proteins.},

prolonged exposure to 2H2O buffer in order to study the structural
changes that lead to both the ligand- and lipid-dependent channel-inactive
states of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). The hydrogen/deuterium
exchange spectra provide insight into both the overall rates and
extent of peptide 1H/2H exchange and the individual rates and extent
to which peptide hydrogens in alpha-helix and beta-sheet conformations
exchange for deuterium. The spectra are also sensitive to the conformation
of the polypeptide backbone and thus the secondary structure of the
nAChR. The various spectral features monitored in the presence and
absence of carbamylcholine and tetracaine are essentially identical,
indicating that there are no large net changes in secondary structure
in the channel-inactive desensitized state. The various spectral
features monitored for the nAChR reconstituted into lipid membranes
either with or without cholesterol are very similar, indicating that
cholesterol is not a major structural regulator of the nAChR. However,
in the absence of both cholesterol and anionic lipids, there is a
slightly enhanced rate of exchange of alpha-helical peptide hydrogens
for deuterium that occurs as a result of either an increase in nAChR
dynamics or an increase in the accessibility of transmembrane peptide
hydrogens to 2H2O. The latter may simply be due to an increase in
the "fluidity" and thus permeability of the lipid bilayers to aqueous

abstract = {Construction of a GABAA receptor homology model based on the acetylcholine
(ACh) receptor structure is complicated by the low sequence similarity
between GABAA and ACh M3 transmembrane segments that creates significant
uncertainty in their alignment. We determined the orientation of
the GABAA M2 and M3 transmembrane segments using disulfide cross-linking.
The M2 residues alpha1M266 (11') and alpha1T267 (12') were mutated
to cysteine in either wild type or single M3 cysteine mutant (alpha1V297C,
alpha1A300C to alpha1A305C) backgrounds. We assayed spontaneous and
induced disulfide bond formation. Reduction with DTT significantly
potentiated GABA-induced currents in alpha1T267C-L301C and alpha1T267C-F304C.
Copper phenanthroline-induced oxidation inhibited GABA-induced currents
in these mutants and in alpha1T267C-A305C. Intrasubunit disulfide
bonds formed between these Cys pairs, implying that the alpha-carbon
separation was at most 5.6 A. The reactive alpha1M3 residues (L301,
F304, A305) lie on the same face of an alpha-helix. The unresponsive
ones (A300, I302, E303) lie on the opposite face. In the resting
state, the reactive side of alpha1M3 faces M2-alpha1T267. In conjunction
with the ACh structure, our data indicate that alignment of GABAA
and ACh M3 requires a single gap in the GABAA M2-M3 loop. In the
presence of GABA, oxidation of alpha1T267C-L301C and alpha1T267C-F304C
had no effect, but oxidation of alpha1T267C-A305C caused a significant
increase in spontaneous channel opening. We infer that, as the channel
opens, the distance and/or orientation between M2-alpha1T267 and
M3-alpha1A305 changes such that the disulfide bond stabilizes the
open state. This begins to define the conformational motion that
M2 undergoes during channel opening.},

The ligands bind to a conserved site and evoke currents that slowly
desensitize over time. The protein forms cation selective channels
with properties that resemble the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.
The high single channel conductance and the comparably simple functional
behavior make ELIC an attractive model system to study general mechanisms
of ion conduction and gating in this important family of neurotransmitter
receptors.},

abstract = {Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to study the
secondary structure of purified Torpedo californica nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor (AChR) in reconstituted membranes. Functional studies have
previously demonstrated that the ion channel activity requires the
presence of both sterol and negatively charged phospholipids in membranes.
The present studies are designed to test the hypothesis that the
alpha-helical structure of AChR may be stabilized by specific lipid
molecules (sterol and/or negatively charged phospholipids) and that
these alpha-helices may be responsible for the formation of a potential
ion channel. FTIR data show statistically significant (p less than
0.005) spectral changes due to cholesterol and negatively charged
phospholipids, respectively. On the basis of standard curves describing
the relationship between the spectral properties and the secondary
structural contents of water-soluble proteins, the observed spectral
change at 931 cm-1 can be interpreted as an apparent change in the
alpha-helix content from about 17{\%} in the absence of sterols to
about 20{\%} in the presence of sterols, suggesting that protein-sterol
interactions increase the helical structure of the AChR molecule.
Similarly, the spectral change at 988 cm-1 can be interpreted as
an apparent increase of beta-sheet content in the AChR molecule from
about 20{\%} to about 24{\%} due to the presence of negatively charged
phospholipids. Functional AChR in membranes thus appears to be correlated
with higher alpha-helical and beta-sheet contents. It is concluded
that one role of specific interactions between membrane protein and
lipid molecules may be to maintain specific secondary structures
necessary to support the ion channel function of AChR.},

acts at micromolar concentrations as an anesthetic and positive allosteric
modulator of gamma-aminobutyric acid responses, whereas it inhibits
muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) at concentrations
above 10 microm. We report here that TDBzl-etomidate, a photoreactive
etomidate analog, acts as a positive allosteric nAChR modulator rather
than an inhibitor, and we identify its binding sites by photoaffinity
labeling. TDBzl-etomidate ({\textgreater}10 microm) increased the submaximal response
to acetylcholine (10 microm) with a 2.5-fold increase at 60 microm.
At higher concentrations, it inhibited the binding of the noncompetitive
antagonists [(3)H]tetracaine and [(3)H]phencyclidine to Torpedo nAChR-rich
membranes (IC(50) values of 0. 8 mm). nAChR-rich membranes were photolabeled
with [(3)H]TDBzl-etomidate, and labeled amino acids were identified
by Edman degradation. For nAChRs photolabeled in the absence of agonist
(resting state), there was tetracaine-inhibitable photolabeling of
amino acids in the ion channel at positions M2-9 (deltaLeu-265) and
M2-13 (alphaVal-255 and deltaVal-269), whereas labeling of alphaM2-10
(alphaSer-252) was not inhibited by tetracaine but was enhanced 10-fold
by proadifen or phencyclidine. In addition, there was labeling in
gammaM3 (gammaMet-299), a residue that contributes to the same pocket
in the nAChR structure as alphaM2-10. The pharmacological specificity
of labeling of residues, together with their locations in the nAChR
structure, indicate that TDBzl-etomidate binds at two distinct sites:
one within the lumen of the ion channel (labeling of M2-9 and -13),
an inhibitory site, and another at the interface between the alpha
and gamma subunits (labeling of alphaM2-10 and gammaMet-299) likely
to be a site for positive allosteric modulation.},

abstract = {New lines of evidence suggest that volatile anesthetics interact specifically
with proteins. Direct binding analysis, however, has been largely
limited to soluble proteins. In this study, specific interaction
was investigated between isoflurane, a clinically important volatile
anesthetic, and membrane-bound nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
(nAChRs) from Torpedo electroplax, using (19)F nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy and gas chromatography. The receptors were reconstituted
into 1, 2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) lipid vesicles.
After correcting for nonspecific partitioning into the lipid, the
equilibrium dissociation constant, K(d), of isoflurane binding to
nAChR at 15 degrees C was found to be 0.36 +/- 0.03 mM. This value
is within the clinically relevant concentration range of the agent.
Based on the receptor concentrations in the vesicle suspension assayed
by the bicinchoninic acid method and the fraction of bound isoflurane,
X(b), determined by gas chromatography, an estimate of an average
of 9-10 specifically bound isoflurane molecules can be made for each
receptor, or two for each subunit. Upon binding, the transverse relaxation
time constant (T(2)) of (19)F resonance of isoflurane is decreased
by nearly three orders of magnitude, indicating a dramatic reduction
in the mobility of specifically bound isoflurane. Kinetic analysis
reveals that the off rate of binding, k(-1), is 1.7 x 10(4) s(-1).
The on rate, k(+1), can thus be calculated to be approximately 4.8
x 10(7) M(-1) s(-1), suggesting a nearly diffusion-limited association.
This is in contrast to anesthetic binding to a soluble protein, bovine
serum albumin (BSA), where k(+1) and k(-1) are at least an order
of magnitude slower. It is concluded that the presence of lipids
may be critical for the correct evaluation of binding kinetics between
volatile anesthetics and neuronal receptors.},

the function of GABA type A receptors (GABA(A)Rs), which mediate
inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain. Here, we used a radiolabeled,
photoreactive etomidate analog ([(3)H]azietomidate), which retains
anesthetic potency in vivo and enhances GABA(A)R function in vitro,
to identify directly, for the first time, amino acids that contribute
to a GABA(A)R anesthetic binding site. For GABA(A)Rs purified by
affinity chromatography from detergent extracts of bovine cortex,
[(3)H]azietomidate photoincorporation was increased by GABA and inhibited
by etomidate in a concentration-dependent manner (IC(50) = 30 microm).
Protein microsequencing of fragments isolated from proteolytic digests
established photolabeling of two residues: one within the alphaM1
transmembrane helix at alpha1Met-236 (and/or the homologous methionines
in alpha2,3,5), not previously implicated in etomidate function,
and one within the betaM3 transmembrane helix at beta3Met-286 (and/or
the homologous methionines in beta1,2), an etomidate sensitivity
determinant. The pharmacological specificity of labeling indicates
that these methionines contribute to a single binding pocket for
etomidate located in the transmembrane domain at the interface between
beta and alpha subunits, in what is predicted by structural models
based on homology with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor to be
a water-filled pocket approximately 50 A below the GABA binding site.
The localization of the etomidate binding site to an intersubunit,
not an intrasubunit, binding pocket is a novel conclusion that suggests
more generally that the localization of drug binding sites to subunit
interfaces may be a feature not only for GABA and benzodiazepines
but also for etomidate and other intravenous and volatile anesthetics.},

unknown. Although the importance of hydrophobicity for general anesthetic
drug potency has long been established, it remains uncertain whether
these "nonspecific" drugs act on membrane proteins directly or by
modification of the physical properties of the lipid membrane or
the lipid-protein interface. We find that specific mutations in the
acetylcholine receptor pore-forming M2 domains enhance the sensitivity
of the receptor to the general anesthetics isoflurane, hexanol, and
octanol, suggesting that these agents act by binding directly to
a discrete protein site at or near these residues. The sensitivity
of the receptor to block by general anesthetics increases with increased
hydrophobicity of these residues, demonstrating that hydrophobic
forces dominate the interaction of drugs with their protein site.
Furthermore, octanol inhibits both wild-type and mutant nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors preferentially after channel opening, which
is consistent with a mechanism where drugs bind within the receptor's
pore. Similar sites on postsynaptic ion channels in brain may represent
general anesthetic targets for modulating consciousness.},

dissimilar molecules. Consequently, the mechanism must involve some
rather nonspecific interactions as the target site, generally held
to be in nerve membranes. The primary site of action has been postulated
to be either lipid or protein or both. Although recent work has cast
doubt on the lipid hypotheses, protein models still flourish. In
particular, Seeman and his co-workers have shown that biological
membranes expand when anaesthetic molecules are added, and that this
expansion is far greater than that which occurs with lipid bilayers.
It has been suggested that this difference is due to extensive conformational
changes in the membrane proteins, and several mechanisms have been
proposed to explain this large expansion of proteins. We now report
the first direct measurements of the volumes occupied by general
anaesthetic molecules in both biological membranes and lipid bilayers.
We show that, in fact, biological membranes expand much less and
lipid bilayers expand more than previously reported. The volume that
a general anaesthetic molecule occupies is essentially the same in
biological membranes, lipid bilayers and water. Our results lead
us to question all generalized membrane expansion hypotheses for
the mechanism of general anaesthesia, in favour of hypotheses would

abstract = {Over the past 20 years it has become apparent that certain steroids,
synthesised de novo in the brain, hence named neurosteroids, produce
immediate changes (within seconds) in neuronal excitability, a time
scale that precludes a genomic locus of action. Identified molecular
targets underlying modulation of brain excitability include both
the inhibitory GABA(A) and the excitatory NMDA receptor. Of particular
interest is the interaction of certain neurosteroids with the GABA(A)
receptor, the major inhibitory receptor in mammalian brain. During
the last decade, compelling evidence has accrued to reveal that locally
produced neurosteroids may selectively "fine tune" neuronal inhibition.
A range of molecular mechanisms including the subunit composition
of the receptor(s), phosphorylation and local steroid metabolism,
underpin the region- and neuronal selectivity of action of neurosteroids
at synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors. The relative contribution
played by each of these mechanisms in a variety of physiological
and pathophysiological scenarios is currently being scrutinised at
a cellular and molecular level. However, it is not known how such
mechanisms may act in concert to influence behavioural profiles in
health and disease. An important question concerns the identification
of the anatomical substrates mediating the repertoire of behaviours
produced by neurosteroids. "Knock-in" mice expressing mutant GABA(A)
subunits engineered to be insensitive to benzodiazepines or general
anaesthetics have proved invaluable in evaluating the role of GABA(A)
receptor subtypes in complex behaviours such as sedation, cognition
and anxiety [Rudolph, U., Mohler, H., 2006. GABA-based therapeutic
approaches: GABA(A) receptor subtype functions. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol.
6, 18-23]. However, the development of a similar approach for neurosteroids
has been hampered by the limited knowledge that, until recently,
has surrounded the identity of the amino acid residues contributing
to the neurosteroid binding pocket. Here, we will review recent progress
in identifying the neurosteroid binding site on the GABA(A) receptor,
and discuss how these discoveries will impact on our understanding
of the role of neurosteroids in health and disease.},

The agreement between experimental and calculated phases along the

allowed a detailed description of the whole receptor in the closed-channel
form, including the ligand-binding and intracellular domains, which
have not previously been interpreted at a chemical level. We confirm
that the two ligand-binding alpha subunits have a different extended
conformation from the three other subunits in the closed channel,
and identify several interactions on both pairs of subunit interfaces,
and within the alpha subunits, which may be responsible for their
"distorted" structures. The ACh-coordinating amino acid side-chains
of the alpha subunits are far apart in the closed channel, indicating
that a localised rearrangement, involving closure of loops B and
C around the bound ACh molecule, occurs upon activation. A comparison
of the structure of the alpha subunit with that of AChBP having ligand
present, suggests how the localised rearrangement overcomes the distortions
and initiates the rotational movements associated with opening of
the channel. Both vestibules of the channel are strongly electronegative,
providing a cation-stabilising environment at either entrance of
the membrane pore. Access to the pore on the intracellular side is
further influenced by narrow lateral windows, which would be expected
to screen out electrostatically ions of the wrong charge and size.},

Here we investigate anesthetic binding to the bacterial Gloeobacter violaceus pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC), a structural homolog of cys-loop receptors, using an experimental and computational hybrid approach. Tryptophan fluorescence quenching experiments showed halothane and thiopental binding at three tryptophan-associated sites in the extracellular (EC) domain, transmembrane (TM) domain, and EC-TM interface of GLIC. An additional binding site at the EC-TM interface was predicted by docking analysis and validated by quenching experiments on the N200W GLIC mutant. The binding affinities (K(D)) of 2.3 ± 0.1 mM and 0.10 ± 0.01 mM were derived from the fluorescence quenching data of halothane and thiopental, respectively. Docking these anesthetics to the original GLIC crystal structure and the structures relaxed by molecular dynamics simulations revealed intrasubunit sites for most halothane binding and intersubunit sites for thiopental binding. Tryptophans were within reach of both intra- and intersubunit binding sites. Multiple molecular dynamics simulations on GLIC in the presence of halothane at different sites suggested that anesthetic binding at the EC-TM interface disrupted the critical interactions for channel gating, altered motion of the TM23 linker, and destabilized the open-channel conformation that can lead to inhibition of GLIC channel current. The study has not only provided insights into anesthetic binding in GLIC, but also demonstrated a successful fusion of experiments and computations for understanding anesthetic actions in complex proteins.},

@article{Barrantes2007,
abstract = {This short overview addresses the effects of cholesterol (Chol) on
the stability, supramolecular organization, and function of the murine
muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR). The biophysical
properties of Chol-AChR interaction are discussed first, as they
constitute, in our view, the very source of the modulation exerted
by Chol on receptor structure and function. In the absence of innervation,
AChRs occur in the form of aggregates that remain stable at the cell-surface
membrane of mammalian model cells over a period of hours. Acute Chol
depletion drastically reduces (approximately 50{\%}) the number of
receptor aggregates by accelerating the rate of endocytosis in a
receptor-expressing clonal cell line. Chol depletion also results
in ion channel gain-of-function of the remaining cell-surface AChRs,
whereas Chol enrichment has the opposite effect. Wide-field and confocal
microscopy show AChR clusters as diffraction-limited puncta of approximately
200 nm diameter. Stimulated emission depletion fluorescence microscopy
resolves these puncta into nanoclusters with an average diameter
of approximately 55 nm. Exploiting the enhanced resolution, the effect
of acute Chol depletion is shown to alter the short- and long-range
organization of AChR nanoclusters. In the short range, the 50{\%} AChRs
remaining at the cell surface form larger nanoclusters. On larger
scales (0.5-3.5 microm) Ripley's K-test on stimulated emission depletion
images reveal changes in nanocluster distribution, attributable to
the Chol-related abolition of cytoskeletal physical barriers normally
preventing the lateral diffusion of AChR nanoclusters. We discuss
these observations in the light of the so-called 'raft' hypothesis
and surmise that Chol content at the plasmalemma homeostatically
modulates cell-surface organization and stability of receptor nanodomains
and fine tunes receptor channel function to temporarily compensate
for acute AChR loss from the cell surface.},

The resulting currents were potentiated by phenobarbitone and diazepam,

abstract = {The neuronal alpha4beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR)
is a potential molecular target for general anesthetics. It is unclear,
however, whether anesthetic action produces the same effect on the
open and closed channels. Computations parallel to our previous open
channel study (J. Phys. Chem. B 2009, 113, 12581) were performed
on the closed-channel alpha4beta2 nAChR to investigate the conformation-dependent
anesthetic effects on channel structures and dynamics. Flexible ligand
docking and over 20 ns molecular dynamics simulations revealed similar
halothane-binding sites in the closed and open channels. The sites
with relatively high binding affinities (approximately -6.0 kcal/mol)
were identified at the interface of extracellular (EC) and transmembrane
(TM) domains or at the interface between alpha4 and beta2 subunits.
Despite similar sites for halothane binding, the closed-channel conformation
showed much less sensitivity than the open channel to the structural
and dynamical perturbations from halothane. Compared to the systems
without anesthetics, the amount of water inside the pore decreased
by 22{\%} in the presence of halothane in the open channel but only
by 6{\%} in the closed channel. Comparison of the nonbonded interactions
at the EC/TM interfaces suggested that the beta2 subunits were more
prone than the alpha4 subunits to halothane binding. In addition,
our data support the notion that halothane exerts its effect by disturbing
the quaternary structure and dynamics of the channel. The study concludes
that sensitivity and global dynamics responsiveness of alpha4beta2
nAChR to halothane are conformation dependent. The effect of halothane
on the global dynamics of the open-channel conformation might also
account for the action of other inhaled general anesthetics.},

When 0.1 microM ivermectin was applied to the perfusion medium, the
responses to 2 microM GABA were enhanced to 273{\%} within 60 s, and
the GABA EC50 was reduced from 8.2 to 3.2 microM. Half-maximal potentiation
of GABA responses was found with 17.8 nM ivermectin. The potentiating
effect of ivermectin diminished to 146{\%} within 10 min but the GABA
EC50 did not change any further. At the same time, the maximal GABA-induced
Cl- current decreased to 64{\%}. Both the fast and slow desensitization
time constants of GABA-activated membrane currents were shortened

irreversible. Modulation of the GABA responses by ivermectin did
not interfere with the potentiation induced by diazepam and pentobarbital
or with the sensitivity to blockade by bicuculline, picrotoxin and
Zn2+. These results support the view that ivermectin binds to a novel
site on the GABAA receptor and allosterically enhances the affinity
of the GABA binding site. The more slowly occurring conformational
changes in the ivermectin-GABAA receptor complex apparently accelerate
the desensitization of the GABAA receptor, reducing the amplitude
of maximal GABA-induced currents.},

four-alpha-helix bundle, (Aalpha(2)-L1M/L38M)(2), was designed to
contain a long hydrophobic core, enclosed by four amphipathic alpha-helices,
for specific anesthetic binding. The structural and dynamical analyses
of (Aalpha(2)-L1M/L38M)(2) in the absence of anesthetics (another
study) showed a highly dynamic antiparallel dimer with an asymmetric
arrangement of the four helices and a lateral accessing pathway from
the aqueous phase to the hydrophobic core. In this study, we determined
the high-resolution NMR structure of (Aalpha(2)-L1M/L38M)(2) in the
presence of halothane, a clinically used volatile anesthetic. The
high-solution NMR structure, with a backbone root mean-square deviation
of 1.72 A (2JST), and the NMR binding measurements revealed that
the primary halothane binding site is located between two side-chains
of W15 from each monomer, different from the initially designed anesthetic
binding sites. Hydrophobic interactions with residues A44 and L18
also contribute to stabilizing the bound halothane. Whereas halothane
produces minor changes in the monomer structure, the quaternary arrangement
of the dimer is shifted by about half a helical turn and twists relative
to each other, which leads to the closure of the lateral access pathway
to the hydrophobic core. Quantitative dynamics analyses, including
Modelfree analysis of the relaxation data and the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill
transverse relaxation dispersion measurements, suggest that the most
profound anesthetic effect is the suppression of the conformational
exchange both near and remote from the binding site. Our results
revealed a novel mechanism of an induced fit between anesthetic molecule
and its protein target, with the direct consequence of protein dynamics
changing on a global rather than a local scale. This mechanism may
be universal to anesthetic action on neuronal proteins.},

AChR-rich membrane fragments using small, unilamellar phosphatidylcholine
liposomes. Conditions have been established that allow further subfractionation
of sucrose gradient purified Torpedo electroplax membranes into AChR-rich
and ATPase-rich populations and that, at the same time, achieve cholesterol
depletion without phospholipid back exchange or fusion. The incubation
of membranes with excess liposomes could only achieve about a 50{\%}
reduction in the molar ratio of cholesterol to phospholipid. In no
case was the number of cholesterol molecules per AChR oligomer reduced
below 36. The remaining cholesterol could not be depleted either
by longer incubations or by multiple, sequential depletions. Cholesterol
depletion was accompanied by a significant increase in bulk membrane
fluidity as measured by electron spin resonance spectroscopy, but
the equilibrium binding parameters of acetylcholine to its receptor
were unaltered. This suggests strongly that there exist two pools
of cholesterol in the AChR-rich Torpedo electroplax membrane: an
easily depleted fraction that influences bulk fluidity, and a tightly-bound
fraction perhaps surrounding the AChR oligomer.},

abstract = {Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) are key players in the
early events of electrical signal transduction at chemical synapses.
The family codes for a structurally conserved scaffold of channel
proteins that open in response to the binding of neurotransmitter
molecules. All proteins share a pentameric organization of identical
or related subunits that consist of an extracellular ligand-binding
domain followed by a transmembrane channel domain. The nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is the most thoroughly studied member
of the pLGIC family (for recent reviews see refs 1-3). Two sources
of structural information provided an architectural framework for
the family. The structure of the soluble acetylcholine-binding protein
(AChBP) defined the organization of the extracellular domain and
revealed the chemical basis of ligand interaction. Electron microscopy
studies of the nAChR from Torpedo electric ray have yielded a picture
of the full-length protein and have recently led to the interpretation
of an electron density map at 4.0 A resolution. Despite the wealth
of experimental information, high-resolution structures of any family
member have so far not been available. Until recently, the pLGICs
were believed to be only expressed in multicellular eukaryotic organisms.
The abundance of prokaryotic genome sequences, however, allowed the
identification of several homologous proteins in bacterial sources.
Here we present the X-ray structure of a prokaryotic pLGIC from the
bacterium Erwinia chrysanthemi (ELIC) at 3.3 A resolution. Our study
reveals the first structure of a pLGIC at high resolution and provides
an important model system for the investigation of the general mechanisms

directly occludes the pore near its cytosolic base. GluCl provides
a framework for understanding mechanisms of fast inhibitory neurotransmission

refined structure was derived to an R-factor of 36.7{\%} (R(free) 37.9{\%})
by standard crystallographic methods, after placing the densities
corresponding to a single molecule into an artificial unit cell.
The agreement between experimental and calculated phases along the
helical layer-lines was used to monitor progress in the refinement
and to give an independent measure of the accuracy. The atomic model
allowed a detailed description of the whole receptor in the closed-channel
form, including the ligand-binding and intracellular domains, which
have not previously been interpreted at a chemical level. We confirm
that the two ligand-binding alpha subunits have a different extended
conformation from the three other subunits in the closed channel,
and identify several interactions on both pairs of subunit interfaces,
and within the alpha subunits, which may be responsible for their
"distorted" structures. The ACh-coordinating amino acid side-chains
of the alpha subunits are far apart in the closed channel, indicating
that a localised rearrangement, involving closure of loops B and
C around the bound ACh molecule, occurs upon activation. A comparison
of the structure of the alpha subunit with that of AChBP having ligand
present, suggests how the localised rearrangement overcomes the distortions
and initiates the rotational movements associated with opening of
the channel. Both vestibules of the channel are strongly electronegative,
providing a cation-stabilising environment at either entrance of
the membrane pore. Access to the pore on the intracellular side is
further influenced by narrow lateral windows, which would be expected
to screen out electrostatically ions of the wrong charge and size.},

the knowledge of anesthetic binding to these proteins remains limited.
Here we investigate anesthetic binding to the bacterial Gloeobacter
violaceus pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC), a structural
homolog of cys-loop receptors, using an experimental and computational
hybrid approach. Tryptophan fluorescence quenching experiments showed
halothane and thiopental binding at three tryptophan-associated sites
in the extracellular (EC) domain, transmembrane (TM) domain, and
EC-TM interface of GLIC. An additional binding site at the EC-TM
interface was predicted by docking analysis and validated by quenching
experiments on the N200W GLIC mutant. The binding affinities (K(D))
of 2.3 ± 0.1 mM and 0.10 ± 0.01 mM were derived from the fluorescence
quenching data of halothane and thiopental, respectively. Docking
these anesthetics to the original GLIC crystal structure and the
structures relaxed by molecular dynamics simulations revealed intrasubunit
sites for most halothane binding and intersubunit sites for thiopental
binding. Tryptophans were within reach of both intra- and intersubunit
binding sites. Multiple molecular dynamics simulations on GLIC in
the presence of halothane at different sites suggested that anesthetic
binding at the EC-TM interface disrupted the critical interactions
for channel gating, altered motion of the TM23 linker, and destabilized
the open-channel conformation that can lead to inhibition of GLIC
channel current. The study has not only provided insights into anesthetic
binding in GLIC, but also demonstrated a successful fusion of experiments
and computations for understanding anesthetic actions in complex

abstract = {Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels from the Cys-loop family mediate
fast chemo-electrical transduction, but the mechanisms of ion permeation
and gating of these membrane proteins remain elusive. Here we present
the X-ray structure at 2.9 A resolution of the bacterial Gloeobacter
violaceus pentameric ligand-gated ion channel homologue (GLIC) at
pH 4.6 in an apparently open conformation. This cationic channel
is known to be permanently activated by protons. The structure is
arranged as a funnel-shaped transmembrane pore widely open on the
outer side and lined by hydrophobic residues. On the inner side,
a 5 A constriction matches with rings of hydrophilic residues that
are likely to contribute to the ionic selectivity. Structural comparison
with ELIC, a bacterial homologue from Erwinia chrysanthemi solved
in a presumed closed conformation, shows a wider pore where the narrow
hydrophobic constriction found in ELIC is removed. Comparative analysis
of GLIC and ELIC reveals, in concert, a rotation of each extracellular
beta-sandwich domain as a rigid body, interface rearrangements, and
a reorganization of the transmembrane domain, involving a tilt of
the M2 and M3 alpha-helices away from the pore axis. These data are
consistent with a model of pore opening based on both quaternary
twist and tertiary deformation.},

Reconstitution studies suggest that this cholesterol may be important
in preserving or modulating the function of the acetylcholine receptor-channel

AChR-rich membrane fragments using small, unilamellar phosphatidylcholine
liposomes. Conditions have been established that allow further subfractionation
of sucrose gradient purified Torpedo electroplax membranes into AChR-rich
and ATPase-rich populations and that, at the same time, achieve cholesterol
depletion without phospholipid back exchange or fusion. The incubation
of membranes with excess liposomes could only achieve about a 50{\%}
reduction in the molar ratio of cholesterol to phospholipid. In no
case was the number of cholesterol molecules per AChR oligomer reduced
below 36. The remaining cholesterol could not be depleted either
by longer incubations or by multiple, sequential depletions. Cholesterol
depletion was accompanied by a significant increase in bulk membrane
fluidity as measured by electron spin resonance spectroscopy, but
the equilibrium binding parameters of acetylcholine to its receptor
were unaltered. This suggests strongly that there exist two pools
of cholesterol in the AChR-rich Torpedo electroplax membrane: an
easily depleted fraction that influences bulk fluidity, and a tightly-bound
fraction perhaps surrounding the AChR oligomer.},

abstract = {General anaesthesia can be induced by a wide variety of structurally
dissimilar molecules. Consequently, the mechanism must involve some
rather nonspecific interactions as the target site, generally held
to be in nerve membranes. The primary site of action has been postulated
to be either lipid or protein or both. Although recent work has cast
doubt on the lipid hypotheses, protein models still flourish. In
particular, Seeman and his co-workers have shown that biological
membranes expand when anaesthetic molecules are added, and that this
expansion is far greater than that which occurs with lipid bilayers.
It has been suggested that this difference is due to extensive conformational
changes in the membrane proteins, and several mechanisms have been
proposed to explain this large expansion of proteins. We now report
the first direct measurements of the volumes occupied by general
anaesthetic molecules in both biological membranes and lipid bilayers.
We show that, in fact, biological membranes expand much less and
lipid bilayers expand more than previously reported. The volume that
a general anaesthetic molecule occupies is essentially the same in
biological membranes, lipid bilayers and water. Our results lead
us to question all generalized membrane expansion hypotheses for
the mechanism of general anaesthesia, in favour of hypotheses would
include more specialized target sites.},

abstract = {Improving our understanding of the mechanisms and effects of anesthetics
is a critically important part of neuroscience. The currently dominant
theory is that anesthetics and similar molecules act by binding to
Cys-loop receptors in the postsynaptic terminal of nerve cells and
potentiate or inhibit their function. Although structures for some
of the most important mammalian channels have still not been determined,
a number of important results have been derived from work on homologous
cationic channels in bacteria. However, partly due to the lack of
a nervous system in bacteria, there are a number of questions about
how these results relate to higher organisms. The recent determination
of a structure of the eukaryotic chloride channel, GluCl, is an important
step toward accurate modeling of mammalian channels, because it is
more similar in function to human Cys-loop receptors such as GABAAR
or GlyR. One potential issue with using GluCl to model other receptors
is the presence of the large ligand ivermectin (IVM) positioned between
all five subunits. Here, we have performed a series of microsecond
molecular simulations to study how the dynamics and structure of
GluCl change in the presence versus absence of IVM. When the ligand
is removed, subunits move at least 2 {\AA} closer to each other compared
to simulations with IVM bound. In addition, the pore radius shrinks
to 1.2 {\AA}, all of which appears to support a model where IVM binding
between subunits stabilizes an open state, and that the relaxed nonIVM
conformations might be suitable for modeling other channels. Interestingly,
the presence of IVM also has an effect on the structure of the important
loop C located at the neurotransmitter-binding pocket, which might
help shed light on its partial agonist behavior.},

out to further characterize lipid-protein interactions involving
the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) from Torpedo californica

microenvironment, cis- and trans-parinaric acids were used to take
advantage of the preferential partitioning behavior of the trans
isomer for the gel phase. A relatively higher extent of energy transfer
from the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of AChR in dielaidoylphosphatidylcholine
bilayers to cis-parinaric acid in both the gel and the fluid phase
suggests that the AChR is surrounded by a relatively fluid annulus
of lipids. The ability of AChR to accommodate and interact with specific
lipids such as cholesterol and fatty acids in the vicinity of pyrene-labeled
cysteine residues in the membranous domain and/or the membrane-water
interface region of the gamma subunit was assessed. Pyrene-labeled
AChR prepared in (6,7-dibromostearoyl)phosphatidylcholine showed
a 25{\%} decrease in fluorescence as sites accessible to phospholipids
were occupied; subsequent addition of dibromocholesterol hemisuccinate
(DiBrCHS) caused further quenching by about 25{\%}. This result is
consistent with the presence of sites accessible to cholesterol,
but not accessible to phospholipids, in the vicinity of the cysteine-bound
pyrene in the membranous domain of the AChR. Quenching by DiBrCHS
was sensitive to the presence of an AChR activator (carbamylcholine)
but not a competitive antagonist (alpha-bungarotoxin). The Stern-Volmer
quenching constant was 0.123 in the absence of added ligands and
0.167 and 0.134 in the presence of carbamylcholine and alpha-bungarotoxin,

receptors belong to the ligand-gated ion channel gene superfamily,
in which all members are comprised of five subunits, each of which
possesses a signature 13-residue disulfide loop (Cys loop) in the
extracellular domain. In this study, we used alanine-scanning mutagenesis
of the residues between C138 and C152 of the Cys loop of the glycine
receptor alpha1 subunit to identify residues critical for receptor
activation and allosteric modulation. Mutation of L142, F145, or
P146 to alanine produced decreases in the potency, maximal amplitude,
and Hill coefficient for currents elicited by glycine and impaired
receptor activation by the agonist taurine. These residues, along
with D148, are positionally conserved in the family of LGIC subunits.
Mutation at several other positions had little or no effect. The
inhaled anesthetics halothane and isoflurane potentiate submaximal
agonist responses at wild-type receptors, via an allosteric site.
The mutations L142A, F145A, P146A, and D148A abolished positive modulation
by these anesthetics, in some cases revealing a small inhibitory
effect. A molecular model of the glycine receptor alpha1 subunit
suggests that the Cys loop is positioned in a region of the receptor
at the interface between the extracellular and transmembrane domains
and that the critical functional residues identified here lie along
the face of a predominantly hydrophobic surface. The present data
implicate the Cys loop as an important functional moiety in the process
of glycine receptor activation and allosteric regulation by anesthetics.},

@article{Ochoa1989,
abstract = {1. Loss of response after prolonged or repeated application of stimulus
is generally termed desensitization. A wide variety of phenomena
occurring in living organisms falls under this general definition
of desensitization. There are two main types of desensitization processes:
specific and non-specific. 2. Desensitization of the nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor is triggered by prolonged or repeated exposure to agonists
and results in inactivation of its ion channel. It is a case of specific
desensitization and is an intrinsic molecular property of the receptor.
3. Desensitization of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor at the
neuromuscular junction was first reported by Katz and Thesleff in
1957. Desensitization of the receptor has been demonstrated by rapid
kinetic techniques and also by the characteristic "burst kinetics"
obtained from single-channel recordings of receptor activity in native
as well as in reconstituted membranes. In spite of a number of studies,
the detailed molecular mechanism of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
desensitization is not known with certainty. The progress of desensitization
is accompanied by an increase in affinity of the receptor for its
agonist. This change in affinity is attributed to a conformational
change of the receptor, as detected by spectroscopic and kinetic
studies. A four-state general model is consistent with the major
experimental observations. 4. Desensitization of the nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor can be potentially modulated by exogenous and endogenous
substances and by covalent modifications of the receptor structure.
Modulators include the noncompetitive blockers, calcium, the thymic
hormone peptides (thymopoietin and thymopentin), substance P, the
calcitonin gene-related peptide, and receptor phosphorylation. Phosphorylation
is an important posttranslational covalent modification that is correlated
with the regulation and desensitization of the receptor through various
protein kinases. 5. Although the physiological significance of desensitization
of the nicotinic receptor is not yet fully understood, desensitization
of receptors probably plays a significant role in the operation of
the neuronal networks associated in memory and learning processes.
Desensitization of the nicotinic receptor could also possibly be
related to the neuromuscular disease, myasthenia gravis.},

classes of lipid binding sites present at the protein-membrane interface
have been postulated: annular binding sites primarily occupied by
phospholipids and non-annular binding sites mainly occupied by cholesterol
[Jones {\&} McNamee (1988) Biochemistry 27, 2364-2374]. We investigated
the binding of these lipids to the nAChR and potential dynamics of
these interactions during events associated with signal transduction
by electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR) using spin-labeled
analogues of phospholipids, androstane, and stearic acid. Protein-lipid
interactions were characterized in receptor-rich membranes prepared
from Torpedo californica electric tissue preserving the native lipid
environment of the nAChR. We found a strong preference of the receptor
for the phosphatidylserine (PS) analogue as compared to the other
probes. Up to 57{\%} of PS were perturbed by the membrane protein,
while the fraction of motionally restricted lipid for the other analogues
was on the order of 30{\%}. After removal of the extramembrane portions
of the membrane-bound receptor, we observed a loss of binding sites
for the spin-labeled analogue of androstane and for stearic acid,

demonstrate the existence of topologically distinct lipid binding
sites for different lipid species. In the case of cholesterol, extramembrane
portions of the receptor are involved, whereas the transmembrane
segments meet the requirements for the binding of phospholipids.
Tyrosine phosphorylation of the nAChR did not affect protein-lipid
interactions in samples of intact nAChR. Similarly, no significant
changes were observed in the presence of carbamoylcholine at concentrations

over 10 ns molecular dynamics simulations in a ternary lipid mixture
of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl
phosphatidic acid (POPA), and CHOL with a ratio of 3:1:1 (Haddadian
et al., J. Phys. Chem. B 2008, 112, 13981). On average there were
65 and 74 interfacial lipids around the closed- and open-channel
alpha4beta2 nAChR, respectively, in the equilibrated simulation systems.
In the open-channel system, 42{\%} of the interfacial POPA had acyl
chains partially inserted into intra- or intersubunit cavities, as
compared to only 7{\%} in the closed-channel alpha4beta2. No CHOL was
found in cavities within single subunits, though some CHOL infiltrated
into the gaps between subunits. Because of its smaller headgroup,
POPA could access some nonannular sites where POPC could not easily
reach due to steric exclusion. Furthermore, POPA acted not only as
an acceptor for hydrogen bonding (H bonding) as POPC did, but also
as a donor through its hydroxyl group for H bonding with the backbone
of the protein. The charged headgroup of POPA allowed the lipid to
form stable salt bridges with conserved Arg and Lys residues at the
interfaces of the transmembrane (TM) and extracellular (EC) or intracellular
(IC) domains of the alpha4beta2. A higher number of salt bridges
and hydrogen bonds (H bonds) between POPA and the alpha4beta2 nAChR
were found in the open system than in the closed system, suggesting
a potential role of POPA in the equilibrium between different channel
states. Most interfacial POPA molecules showed lower order parameters
than the bulk POPA due to the mixed effect of gauche defects, hydrophobic
mismatch, and the lipid orientations near the magic angle. These
unique properties enable the interfacial POPA to achieve what POPC
cannot with regard to specific interactions with the protein, thereby
making POPA essential for the function of nAChR.},

GABA (RDL) and glycine (alpha1) receptors expressed in Xenopus laevis

agonist (GABA or glycine as appropriate) evoked currents at GABA(A),
glycine, and RDL receptors, whereas etomidate and 5alpha3alpha were
highly selective for the GABA(A) receptor. Utilizing site-directed
mutagenesis, we demonstrate that the nature of the interaction of
propofol, pentobarbitone and etomidate (but not 5alpha3alpha) with
mammalian and invertebrate ionotropic GABA receptors depends critically
upon the nature of a single amino acid located in the second transmembrane
region (TM2) of these receptors. These data are discussed in relation
to the specificity of action of general anaesthetics.},

abstract = {We have modelled the transmembrane region of the alpha 7 nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor as a mixed alpha-helical/beta-sheet structure.
The model was mainly based on the crystal structure of a pore-forming
toxin, heat-labile enterotoxin. This is a pentameric protein having
a central pore or channel composed of five alpha-helices, one from
each of the 5 B subunits that form this pentamer. The remainder of
this structure is beta-sheet, loops and a short alpha-helix, not
included in the model. The model uses this channel as a template
to build the transmembrane region, from M1 to the middle of M3. The
remainder of M3 and M4 were built de novo as alpha-helices. Great
consideration was given to labelling data available for the transmembrane
region. In general terms, the shape of the model agrees very well
with that obtained independently by electron microscopic analysis
and the secondary structure predicted by the model is in accord with
that estimated independently by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
The M2 helical region of the model is only slightly kinked, contrary
to what is inferred from electron microscopic analysis, but has the
same overall shape and form. On the membrane face of the model, the
presence of deep pockets may provide the structural basis for the
distinction between annular and non-annular lipid binding sites.
Also, the transmembrane region is clearly asymmetric in the direction
perpendicular to the membrane, and this may have strong influence
on the surrounding lipid composition of each leaflet of the cytoplasmic
membrane.},

cryo-electron microscopy data of the membrane domain collected on

complete three-dimensional model to explore protein flexibility.
Among the first 10 lowest frequency modes, only the first mode produces
a structural reorganization compatible with channel gating: a wide
opening of the channel pore caused by a concerted symmetrical quaternary
twist motion of the protein with opposing rotations of the upper
(extracellular) and lower (transmembrane) domains. Still, significant
reorganizations are observed within each subunit, that involve their
bending at the domain interface, an increase of angle between the
two beta-sheets composing the extracellular domain, the internal
beta-sheet being significantly correlated to the movement of the
M2 alpha-helical segment. This global symmetrical twist motion of
the pentameric protein complex, which resembles the opening transition
of other multimeric ion channels, reasonably accounts for the available
experimental data and thus likely describes the nAChR gating process.},

abstract = {Why agonist-induced activation of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
(nAcChoR) fails completely in the absence of cholesterol is unknown.
Affinity-purified nAcChoRs from Torpedo reconstituted into 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine/1,
2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate/steroid bilayers at mole ratios
of 58:12:30 were used to distinguish between three regions of the
membrane where cholesterol might act: the lipid bilayer, the lipid-protein
interface, or sites within the protein itself. In the bilayer, the
role of fluidity has been ruled out and certain neutral lipids can
substitute for cholesterol [C. Sunshine, M.G. McNamee, Biochim. Biophys.
Acta 1191 (1994) 59-64]; therefore, we first tested the hypothesis
that flip-flop of cholesterol across the membrane is important; a
plausible mechanism might be the relief of mechanical bending strain
induced by a conformation change that expands the two leaflets of
the bilayer asymmetrically. Cholesterol analogs prevented from flipping
by charged groups attached to the 3-position's hydroxyl supported
channel opening, contrary to this hypothesis. The second hypothesis
is that interstitial cholesterol binding sites exist deep within
the nAcChoR that must be occupied for channel opening to occur. When
cholesterol hemisuccinate was covalently 'tethered' to the glycerol
backbone of phosphatidylcholine, channel opening was still supported.
Thus, if there are functionally important cholesterol sites, they
must be very close to the lipid-protein interface and might be termed
periannular.},

abstract = {Ivermectin is an anthelmintic drug that works by activating glutamate-gated
chloride channel receptors (GluClRs) in nematode parasites. GluClRs
belong to the Cys-loop receptor family that also includes glycine
receptor (GlyR) chloride channels. GluClRs and A288G mutant GlyRs
are both activated by low nanomolar ivermectin concentrations. The
crystal structure of the Caenorhabditis elegans $\alpha$ GluClR complexed
with ivermectin has recently been published. Here, we probed ivermectin
sensitivity determinants on the $\alpha$1 GlyR using site-directed mutagenesis
and electrophysiology. Based on a mutagenesis screen of transmembrane
residues, we identified Ala288 and Pro230 as crucial sensitivity
determinants. A comparison of the actions of selamectin and ivermectin
suggested the benzofuran C05-OH was required for high efficacy. When
taken together with docking simulations, these results supported
a GlyR ivermectin binding orientation similar to that seen in the
GluClR crystal structure. However, whereas the crystal structure
shows that ivermectin interacts with the alpha GluClR via H-bonds
with Leu218, Ser260, and Thr285 ($\alpha$ GluClR numbering), our data indicate
that H-bonds with residues homologous to Ser260 and Thr285 are not
important for high ivermectin sensitivity or direct agonist efficacy
in A288G $\alpha$1 GlyRs or three other GluClRs. Our data also suggest that
van der Waals interactions between the ivermectin disaccharide and
GlyR M2-M3 loop residues are unimportant for high ivermectin sensitivity.
Thus, although our results corroborate the ivermectin binding orientation
as revealed by the crystal structure, they demonstrate that some
of the binding interactions revealed by this structure do not pertain
to other highly ivermectin-sensitive Cys-loop receptors.},

mapped to proteolytic fragments consistent with PM labeling of cysteine
residues in alphaM1, alphaM4, gammaM1, and gammaM4. The topography
of the pyrene-labeled Cys residues with respect to the membrane and
the apparent affinity for representative lipids were determined by
differential fluorescence quenching with spin-labeled derivatives
of fatty acids, phosphatidylcholine, and the steroids cholestane

selectivity for the whole AChR protein and its transmembrane domains.
In all cases labeled residues were found to lie in a shallow position.
For M4 segments, this is compatible with a linear alpha-helical structure,
but not so for M1, for which "classical" models locate Cys residues
at the center of the hydrophobic stretch. The transmembrane topography
of M1 can be rationalized on the basis of the presence of a substantial
amount of non-helical structure, and/or of kinks attributable to
the occurrence of the evolutionarily conserved proline residues.
The latter is a striking feature of M1 in the AChR and all members
of the rapid ligand-gated ion channel superfamily.},

anesthesia might arise because of interactions at molecular sites

we calculated in molecular dynamics simulations the free energy profiles
for the transfer of anesthetic 1,1,2-trifluoroethane and nonanesthetic
perfluoroethane across water-membrane and water-hexane interfaces.
Consistent with the hypothesis, it was found that trifluoroethane,
but not perfluoroethane, exhibits a free energy minimum and, therefore,
increased concentrations at both interfaces. The transfer of trifluoroethane

accompanied by a considerable, solvent-induced shift in the conformational

was administered systemically to rats which were tested in the Geller-Seifter
conflict paradigm, an established animal model of anxiety. Allopregnanolone
was found to produce significant anxiolytic-like effects at a dose
of 8 mg/kg. When three ligands that function at different sites on
the gamma-aminobutyric acid/benzodiazepine receptor-chloride ionophore
complex (GABA(A) receptors) were examined in conjunction with allopregnanolone,
the anti-conflict effects of allopregnanolone were effectively reversed
only by the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist RO15-4513 (ethyl-8-azido-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo
[1,5-alpha]-[1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate). Since this inverse
agonist has been reported to inhibit the GABA(A)-activated chloride
flux in neuronal membranes, it is likely that the stimulation of
the chloride channel in GABA(A) receptors is an important component
of the effects of allopregnanolone. In contrast, the benzodiazepine
receptor antagonist flumazenil (ethyl-8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo

which binds at the picrotoxinin site on the GABA(A) receptors and
blocks the behavioral actions of ethanol, also dose-dependently reversed
the anti-conflict effect of this neurosteroid. The results suggest
that allopregnanolone may be working either at a site specific for

evidence shows that the effects on lipid bilayers of clinically relevant
levels of anesthetics are very small. Effects on most proteins are
also small, but there are notable examples of proteins that are extremely
sensitive to anesthetics and mimic the pharmacological profile of
anesthetic target sites in animals. Such target sites are amphiphilic
in nature, having both hydrophobic and polar components. The polar
components appear to behave as good hydrogen-bond acceptors but poor
hydrogen-bond donors. Although the targets can accept molecules with
a wide variety of shapes and chemical groupings, they are unaffected
by molecules exceeding a certain size. Overall, the data can be explained
by supposing that the primary target sites underlying general anesthesia

for all transmembrane (TM) domains. This is in disagreement with
several previous reports that the first TM domain of nAChR and other
Cys-loop receptors are not entirely helical. In this study, we determined
the structure and backbone dynamics of an extended segment encompassing
the first TM domain (TM1e) of nAChR beta(2) subunit in dodecylphosphocholine
micelles, using solution-state NMR and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy.
Both CD and NMR results show less helicity in TM1e than in Torpedo
nAChR structure (Protein Data Bank: 2BG9). The helical ending residues
at the C-terminus are the same in the TM1e NMR structure and the
Torpedo nAChR structure, but the helical starting residue (I-217)
in TM1e is seven residues closer to the C-terminus. Interestingly,
the helical starting residue is two residues before the highly conserved
P-219, in accordance with the hypothesis that proline causes helical
distortions at three residues preceding it. The NMR relaxation measurements
show a dynamics pattern consistent with TM1e structure. The substantial
nonhelical content adds greater flexibilities to TM1e, thereby implicating
a different molecular basis for nAChR function compared to a longer
and more rigid helical TM1.},

compounds, 1-chloro-1,2,2-trifluorocyclobutane (F3) and 1,2-dichlorohexafluorocyclobutane
(F6), exhibit completely different anesthetic properties. Whereas
the former is a potent general anesthetic, the latter produces no
anesthesia. Two linear compounds, isoflurane and 2,3-dichlorooctofluorobutane
(F8), although not a structural pair, also show the same anesthetic
discrepancy. Using 19F nuclear magnetic spectroscopy, we investigated
the time-averaged submolecular distribution of these compounds in
a vesicle suspension of phosphatidylcholine lipids. A two-site exchange
model was used to interpret the observed changes in resonance frequencies
as a function of the solubilization of these compounds in membrane
and in water. At clinically relevant concentrations, the anesthetics
F3 and isoflurane distributed preferentially to regions of the membrane
that permit easy contact with water. The frequency changes of these
two anesthetics can be well characterized by the two-site exchange
model. In contrast, the nonanesthetics F6 and F8 solubilized deeply
into the lipid core, and their frequency change significantly deviated
from the prediction of the model. It is concluded that although anesthetics
and nonanesthetics may show similar hydrophobicity in bulk solvents
such as olive oil, their distributions in various regions in biomembranes,
and hence their effective concentrations at different submolecular
sites, may differ significantly.},

a reorganization of the transmembrane domain, involving a tilt of

of two nonadjacent subunits. The Cys loop appears to act as a stator
around which the alpha-helical transmembrane domain can pivot and
rotate relative to the rigid beta-sheet binding domain. The M2-M3

abstract = {The effects of lipids on the maintenance of characteristic functional
properties of the acetylcholine receptor during the course of reconstitution
into lipid vesicles were studied by following the kinetics of agonist-induced
state transitions. The requirements for successful preservation of
these properties could be dissected into two components: (a) adequate
nature and concentration of lipids during detergent solubilization;
(b) correct lipid environment during reincorporation into lipid vesicles
by the cholate dialysis procedure. Optimal bulk lipid concentrations
and lipid:cholate ratios for preserving state transitions during
solubilization were studied by using both crude soybean lipids and
pure synthetic phospholipids. The latter class of lipids was found
to be unsuitable substitutes for the crude soybean lipids, irrespective
of their polar head group and/or fatty acyl chain, even when detergent:lipid
ratios as high as 1:1 (w/w) were employed. Addition of cholesteryl
hemisuccinate was able to make up this deficiency, attaining preservation
of acetylcholine receptor state transitions at cholate:steroid ratios
of about 6:1 (w/w). The presence of steroid decreased the amount
of protein solubilized. The correct choice of lipid type was also
essential to the reincorporation step, and higher concentrations
of lipid were required--about 20 mg/mL for soybean lipids. Pure phospholipids
at similar concentrations, however, were unable to maintain the state
transitions. Again, steroid (40-46{\%} cholesteryl hemisuccinate/mol
of total lipid) provided the adequate conditions at the reincorporation
stage and enhanced the amount of protein reincorporated into the
vesicles. A large (70-90{\%}) percentage of the receptor was reincorporated
with the correct vectorial sidedness. No specificity could be detected
for the phospholipid polar head or alkyl chain in relation to any
of these findings. The effect of the protein on the physical state
of the lipids in the reconstituted vesicles was studied by diphenylhexatriene
fluorescence depolarization. The results may be interpreted as a
disordering of the acyl chains in the gel state and an ordering in
the liquid-crystalline state in the presence of protein, accompanied
by shifts in the transition temperatures of the pure phospholipids
to lower values.},

abstract = {The X-ray structure of a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel from
Erwinia chrysanthemi (ELIC) has recently provided structural insight
into this family of ion channels at high resolution. The structure
shows a homo-pentameric protein with a barrel-stave architecture
that defines an ion-conduction pore located on the fivefold axis
of symmetry. In this structure, the wide aqueous vestibule that is
encircled by the extracellular ligand-binding domains of the five
subunits narrows to a discontinuous pore that spans the lipid bilayer.
The pore is constricted by bulky hydrophobic residues towards the
extracellular side, which probably serve as barriers that prevent
the diffusion of ions. This interrupted pore architecture in ELIC
thus depicts a non-conducting conformation of a pentameric ligand-gated
ion channel, the thermodynamically stable state in the absence of
bound ligand. As ligand binding promotes pore opening in these ion
channels and the specific ligand for ELIC has not yet been identified,
we have turned our attention towards a homologous protein from the
cyanobacterium Gloebacter violaceus (GLIC). GLIC was shown to form
proton-gated channels that are activated by a pH decrease on the
extracellular side and that do not desensitize after activation.
Both prokaryotic proteins, ELIC and GLIC form ion channels that are
selective for cations over anions with poor discrimination among
monovalent cations, characteristics that resemble the conduction
properties of the cation-selective branch of the family that includes
acetylcholine and serotonin receptors. Here we present the X-ray
structure of GLIC at 3.1 A resolution. The structure reveals a conformation
of the channel that is distinct from ELIC and that probably resembles
the open state. In combination, both structures suggest a novel gating
mechanism for pentameric ligand-gated ion channels where channel
opening proceeds by a change in the tilt of the pore-forming helices.},

of the AcChR in asolectin phospholipid vesicles in the absence of
either cholesterol or the nonpolar lipids present in crude asolectin
extracts results in a considerable loss of the ability of the AcChR
to support cation channel function. This functional loss is accompanied
by spectral changes in the conformationally-sensitive amide I band
of the protein infrared spectrum which are indicative of alteration
in the protein secondary structure. Quantitative estimation of such
alteration by band-fitting analysis reveals a marked decrease in
ordered protein structures such as the alpha-helix and beta-pleated
sheet, concomitant with an increase in less ordered structures appearing
at 1644 cm-1 in the infrared spectrum. Furthermore, the addition
of increasing amounts of cholesterol to the reconstituted bilayer
produces a progressive, complete recovery both in the control of
cation channel function and in the infrared spectrum. This restoration
of AcChR structure and function by cholesterol, however, does not
occur when the AcChR is reconstituted in vesicles made from purified
egg phosphatidylcholine, thus suggesting that the presence in the
reconstituted bilayer of phospholipids other than phosphatidylcholine
may be required for cholesterol to exert its modulatory effects.(ABSTRACT

acid (GABA), called the GABAA receptor, is a member of a gene superfamily
of ligand-gated ion channels. This receptor is a hetero-oligomeric
protein composed of several distinct polypeptide types (alpha, beta,
gamma, and delta). Molecular cloning of these polypeptides reveals
that they show 20-40{\%} identity with each other, and 10-20{\%} identity
with polypeptides of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and strychnine-sensitive
glycine receptor. Each polypeptide type is also represented by a
family of genes whose members have 60-80{\%} amino acid sequence identity.
Regions of conserved and variable amino acid sequence suggest structural
and functional domains within each polypeptide. All of the polypeptides
when expressed in heterologous cells produce GABA-activated chloride
channels, and the different subtypes express different pharmacological
properties. The distributions of mRNAs for the different GABAA receptor
polypeptides and their subtypes show significant brain regional variation
consistent with pharmacological and biochemical evidence for receptor
heterogeneity. Subpopulations of GABAA receptors with different cellular
and regional locations show differential sensitivity to GABA, to
modulators like steroids, to physiological regulation, to disease
processes, and to pharmacological manipulation by drugs such as benzodiazepines.
The properties of the different subpopulations of GABAA receptors
are determined by which one or more of the different polypeptides

of different oligomeric protein structures. Molecular cloning techniques
have produced rapid advances in understanding the GABAA receptor

abstract = {In any lipid bilayer membrane, there is an upper limit on the cholesterol
concentration that can be accommodated within the bilayer structure;
excess cholesterol will precipitate as crystals of pure cholesterol
monohydrate. This cholesterol solubility limit is a well-defined
quantity. It is a first-order phase boundary in the phospholipid/cholesterol
phase diagram. There are many different solubility limits in the
literature, but no clear picture has emerged that can unify the disparate
results. We have studied the effects that different sample preparation
methods can have on the apparent experimental solubility limit. We
find that artifactual demixing of cholesterol can occur during conventional
sample preparation and that this demixed cholesterol may produce
artifactual cholesterol crystals. Therefore, phospholipid/cholesterol
suspensions which are prepared by conventional methods may manifest
variable, falsely low cholesterol solubility limits. We have developed
two novel preparative methods which are specifically designed to
prevent demixing during sample preparation. For detection of the
cholesterol crystals, X-ray diffraction has proven to be quantitative
and highly sensitive. Experiments based on these methods yield reproducible
and precise cholesterol solubility limits: 66 mol{\%} for phosphatidylcholine
(PC) bilayers and 51 mol{\%} for phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) bilayers.
We present evidence that these are true, equilibrium values. In contrast
to the dramatic headgroup effect (PC vs. PE), acyl chain variations
had no effect on the cholesterol solubility limit in four different
PC/cholesterol mixtures.},

abstract = {Despite its long history of use and abuse in human culture, the molecular
basis for alcohol action in the brain is poorly understood. The recent
determination of the atomic-scale structure of GLIC, a prokaryotic
member of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC) family,
provides a unique opportunity to characterize the structural basis
for modulation of these channels, many of which are alcohol targets
in brain. We observed that GLIC recapitulates bimodal modulation
by n-alcohols, similar to some eukaryotic pLGICs: methanol and ethanol
weakly potentiated proton-activated currents in GLIC, whereas n-alcohols
larger than ethanol inhibited them. Mapping of residues important
to alcohol modulation of ionotropic receptors for glycine, ?-aminobutyric
acid, and acetylcholine onto GLIC revealed their proximity to transmembrane
cavities that may accommodate one or more alcohol molecules. Site-directed
mutations in the pore-lining M2 helix allowed the identification
of four residues that influence alcohol potentiation, with the direction
of their effects reflecting ?-helical structure. At one of the potentiation-enhancing
residues, decreased side chain volume converted GLIC into a highly
ethanol-sensitive channel, comparable to its eukaryotic relatives.
Covalent labeling of M2 positions with an alcohol analog, a methanethiosulfonate
reagent, further implicated residues at the extracellular end of
the helix in alcohol binding. Molecular dynamics simulations elucidated
the structural consequences of a potentiation-enhancing mutation
and suggested a structural mechanism for alcohol potentiation via
interaction with a transmembrane cavity previously termed the "linking
tunnel." These results provide a unique structural model for independent
potentiating and inhibitory interactions of n-alcohols with a pLGIC
family member.},

abstract = {Volatile anaesthetics have historically been considered to act in
a nonspecific manner on the central nervous system. More recent studies,
however, have revealed that the receptors for inhibitory neurotransmitters
such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine are sensitive
to clinically relevant concentrations of inhaled anaesthetics. The
function of GABA(A) and glycine receptors is enhanced by a number
of anaesthetics and alcohols, whereas activity of the related GABA
rho1 receptor is reduced. We have used this difference in pharmacology
to investigate the molecular basis for modulation of these receptors
by anaesthetics and alcohols. By using chimaeric receptor constructs,
we have identified a region of 45 amino-acid residues that is both
necessary and sufficient for the enhancement of receptor function.
Within this region, two specific amino-acid residues in transmembrane
domains 2 and 3 are critical for allosteric modulation of both GABA(A)
and glycine receptors by alcohols and two volatile anaesthetics.
These observations support the idea that anaesthetics exert a specific
effect on these ion-channel proteins, and allow for the future testing
of specific hypotheses of the action of anaesthetics.},

in the superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels (LGIC). Members of
this superfamily mediate fast intercellular communication in response

and functional crosstalk between the AChR and lipids in the membrane
microenvironment, and the modulation exerted by the latter on ligand
binding and ion translocation. Experimental approaches using Laurdan
extrinsic fluorescence and F{\"{i}}¿½rster-type resonance energy transfer
(FRET) that led to the characterization of the polarity and molecular
dynamics of the liquid-ordered phase AChR-vicinal lipids and the
bulk membrane lipids, and the asymmetry of the AChR-rich membrane
are reviewed first. The topological relationship between protein
and lipid moieties and the changes in physical properties induced
by exogenous lipids are discussed next. This background information
lays the basis for understanding the occurrence of lipid sites in
the AChR transmembrane region, and the selectivity of the protein-lipid
interactions. Changes in FRET efficiency induced by fatty acids,
phospholipid and cholesterol (Chol), led to the identification of
discrete sites for these lipids on the AChR protein, and electron-spin
resonance (ESR) spectroscopy has recently facilitated determination
of the stoichiometry and selectivity for the AChR of the shell lipid.
The influence of lipids on AChR function is discussed next. Combined
single-channel and site-directed mutagenesis data fostered the recognition
of lipid-sensitive residues in the transmembrane region, dissecting
their contribution to ligand binding and channel gating, opening
and closing. Experimental evidence supports the notion that the interface
between the protein moiety and the adjacent lipid shell is the locus
of a variety of pharmacologically relevant processes, including the
action of steroids and other lipids.},

At much higher halothane concentrations, we have identified additional

acts at micromolar concentrations as an anesthetic and positive allosteric
modulator of gamma-aminobutyric acid responses, whereas it inhibits
muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) at concentrations
above 10 microm. We report here that TDBzl-etomidate, a photoreactive
etomidate analog, acts as a positive allosteric nAChR modulator rather
than an inhibitor, and we identify its binding sites by photoaffinity
labeling. TDBzl-etomidate ({\textgreater}10 microm) increased the submaximal response
to acetylcholine (10 microm) with a 2.5-fold increase at 60 microm.
At higher concentrations, it inhibited the binding of the noncompetitive
antagonists [(3)H]tetracaine and [(3)H]phencyclidine to Torpedo nAChR-rich
membranes (IC(50) values of 0. 8 mm). nAChR-rich membranes were photolabeled
with [(3)H]TDBzl-etomidate, and labeled amino acids were identified
by Edman degradation. For nAChRs photolabeled in the absence of agonist
(resting state), there was tetracaine-inhibitable photolabeling of
amino acids in the ion channel at positions M2-9 (deltaLeu-265) and
M2-13 (alphaVal-255 and deltaVal-269), whereas labeling of alphaM2-10
(alphaSer-252) was not inhibited by tetracaine but was enhanced 10-fold
by proadifen or phencyclidine. In addition, there was labeling in
gammaM3 (gammaMet-299), a residue that contributes to the same pocket
in the nAChR structure as alphaM2-10. The pharmacological specificity
of labeling of residues, together with their locations in the nAChR
structure, indicate that TDBzl-etomidate binds at two distinct sites:
one within the lumen of the ion channel (labeling of M2-9 and -13),
an inhibitory site, and another at the interface between the alpha
and gamma subunits (labeling of alphaM2-10 and gammaMet-299) likely
to be a site for positive allosteric modulation.},

of stearic acid (16-doxylstearic acid), androstane, phosphatidylcholine

phosphatidic acid (PA). The phospholipid spin-labels had 16-doxylstearic

corresponding to a relatively mobile bilayer component and a motionally
restricted "protein-perturbed" component. The relative amounts of
mobile and perturbed components were quantitated by spectral subtraction
and integration techniques. The mobile/perturbed ratio was somewhat
temperature dependent, and the results are discussed in terms of
exchange between mobile and perturbed environments. Plots of the
mobile/perturbed ratios vs. lipid/protein ratios at 1 degree C gave
straight lines from which the relative binding affinity of each spin-label

that this steroid probe was incorporated into the AChR-rich membrane
vesicles in regions which were to a certain extent enriched preferentially
in the steroid, both in the presence and in the absence of local
anaesthetics. Since the nitroxide group present in CSL is also a
paramagnetic quencher of the intrinsic protein fluorescence, this
property was used to characterize the AChR-steroid interactions.
The quenching induced by CSL was sensitive both to AChR concentration
and to the action of cholinergic agonists. In competition experiments,
the ability of CSL to quench the AChR intrinsic fluorescence was
markedly inhibited by benzocaine, tetracaine and QX-222 (a quaternary
trimethylammonium derivative of lidocaine), and was totally inhibited
by procaine. The effectiveness of local anaesthetics in inhibiting
CSL-induced quenching followed the order: procaine much greater than
benzocaine approximately greater than tetracaine greater than QX-222.
This inhibition effect was shown not to be charge-dependent. The
data can be interpreted in terms of a model requiring specific association
sites for local anaesthetics on the hydrophobic surface of the AChR
which at least partially overlap with those for steroids.},

the anesthetic sensitivity of these receptors by using alpha(3)/alpha(7)
chimeric subunits that are able to form functional homomeric receptors.
By comparing the sensitivities of a number of chimeras to the inhalational
agent halothane we show that the short (13 amino acids) putative
extracellular loop connecting the second and third transmembrane
segments is a critical determinant of anesthetic sensitivity. In
addition, using site-directed mutagenesis, we show that two particular
amino acids in this loop play a dominant role. When mutations are
made in this loop, there is a good correlation between increasing
anesthetic sensitivity and decreasing acetylcholine sensitivity.
We conclude that this extracellular loop probably does not participate
directly in anesthetic binding, but rather determines receptor sensitivity
indirectly by playing a critical role in transducing anesthetic binding
into an effect on channel gating.},

@article{Haddadian2008,
abstract = {The neuronal alpha4beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR)
is one of the most widely expressed nAChR subtypes in the brain.
Its subunits have high sequence identity (54 and 46{\%} for alpha4
and beta2, respectively) with alpha and beta subunits in Torpedo
nAChR. Using the known structure of the Torpedo nAChR as a template,
the closed-channel structure of the alpha4beta2 nAChR was constructed
through homology modeling. Normal-mode analysis was performed on
this closed structure and the resulting lowest frequency mode was
applied to it for a "twist-to-open" motion, which increased the minimum
pore radius from 2.7 to 3.4 A and generated an open-channel model.
Nicotine could bind to the predicted agonist binding sites in the
open-channel model but not in the closed one. Both models were subsequently
equilibrated in a ternary lipid mixture via extensive molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations. Over the course of 11 ns MD simulations, the open
channel remained open with filled water, but the closed channel showed
a much lower water density at its hydrophobic gate comprised of residues
alpha4-V259 and alpha4-L263 and their homologous residues in the
beta2 subunits. Brownian dynamics simulations of Na+ permeation through
the open channel demonstrated a current-voltage relationship that
was consistent with experimental data on the conducting state of
alpha4beta2 nAChR. Besides establishment of the well-equilibrated
closed- and open-channel alpha4beta2 structural models, the MD simulations
on these models provided valuable insights into critical factors
that potentially modulate channel gating. Rotation and tilting of
TM2 helices led to changes in orientations of pore-lining residue
side chains. Without concerted movement, the reorientation of one
or two hydrophobic side chains could be enough for channel opening.
The closed- and open-channel structures exhibited distinct patterns
of electrostatic interactions at the interface of extracellular and
transmembrane domains that might regulate the signal propagation
of agonist binding to channel opening. A potential prominent role
of the beta2 subunit in channel gating was also elucidated in the
study.},

abstract = {Propofol is the most widely used injectable general anesthetic. Its
targets include ligand-gated ion channels such as the GABA(A) receptor,
but such receptor-channel complexes remain challenging to study at
atomic resolution. Until structural biology methods advance to the
point of being able to deal with systems such as the GABA(A) receptor,
it will be necessary to use more tractable surrogates to probe the
molecular details of anesthetic recognition. We have previously shown
that recognition of inhalational general anesthetics by the model
protein apoferritin closely mirrors recognition by more complex and
clinically relevant protein targets; here we show that apoferritin
also binds propofol and related GABAergic anesthetics, and that the
same binding site mediates recognition of both inhalational and injectable
anesthetics. Apoferritin binding affinities for a series of propofol
analogs were found to be strongly correlated with the ability to
potentiate GABA responses at GABA(A) receptors, validating this model
system for injectable anesthetics. High resolution x-ray crystal
structures reveal that, despite the presence of hydrogen bond donors
and acceptors, anesthetic recognition is mediated largely by van
der Waals forces and the hydrophobic effect. Molecular dynamics simulations
indicate that the ligands undergo considerable fluctuations about
their equilibrium positions. Finally, apoferritin displays both structural
and dynamic responses to anesthetic binding, which may mimic changes
elicited by anesthetics in physiologic targets like ion channels.},

abstract = {The GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor has been solubilized from membrane
preparations of bovine cerebral cortex and has been reconstituted,
in a functionally active form, into phospholipid vesicles. In preliminary
experiments, the receptor was labeled with the photoactive benzodiazepine
[3H]flunitrazepam prior to solubilization. A peptide of apparent
molecular weight 53,500 was specifically labeled by this method,
and this was used as a marker for the receptor during the reconstitution
procedures. The labeled protein was solubilized with approximately
40{\%} efficiency by 1{\%} beta-octyl glucoside. Reconstitution was achieved
by mixing the solubilized proteins with a 4:1 mixture of soybean
asolectin and bovine brain phospholipids, followed by chromatography
on Sephadex G-50-80 to remove detergent. The incorporation of the
GABAA receptor into membrane vesicles has been verified by sucrose
gradient centrifugation in which the [3H]-flunitrazepam-labeled peptide
comigrated with [14C]phosphatidylcholine used as a lipid marker.
Vesicles prepared without labeled markers retained the ability to
bind both [3H]flunitrazepam and the GABA analogue [3H]muscimol. Furthermore,
the binding parameters were very similar to those measured using
native membrane preparations. A novel fluorescence technique has
been used to measure chloride transport mediated by the GABAA receptor
in reconstituted vesicles. Chloride influx was rapidly stimulated
in the presence of micromolar concentrations of muscimol and was
blocked by preincubation of the membranes with muscimol (desensitization).
Flux was also blocked by pretreatment with the competitive GABAA
receptor blocker bicuculline or with the noncompetitive GABAA receptor
antagonist picrotoxin.},

abstract = {Protein-lipid interactions were studied by using Torpedo californica
acetylcholine receptor (AChR) as a model system by reconstituting
purified AChR into membranes containing various synthetic lipids
and native lipids. AChR function was determined by measuring two
activities at 4 degrees C: (1) low to high agonist affinity-state
transition of AChR in the presence of an agonist (carbamylcholine)
in either membrane fragments or sealed vesicles and (2) ion-gating
activity of AChR-containing vesicles in response to carbamylcholine.
Sixteen samples were examined, each containing different lipid compositions
including phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylethanolamine,
asolectin, neutral lipid depleted asolectin, native lipids, and cholesterol-depleted
native lipids. Phosphatidylcholines with different configurations
of fatty acyl chains were used. The dynamic structures of these membranes
were probed by incorporating spin-labeled fatty acid into AChR-containing
vesicles and measuring the order parameters. It was found that both
aspects of AChR function were highly dependent on the lipid environment
even though carbamylcholine binding itself was not affected. An appropriate
membrane fluidity was necessarily required to allow the interconversion
between the low and high affinity states of AChR. An optimal fluidity
hypothesis is proposed to account for the conformational transition
properties of membrane proteins. In addition, the conformational
change was only a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the
AChR-mediated ion flux activity. Among membranes in which AChR manifested
the affinity-state transition, only those containing both cholesterol
and negatively charged phospholipids (such as phosphatidic acid)
retained the ion-gating activity.},

as the cholesterol carrier. 2. Enrichment of neurones with cholesterol
increased the effects of the non-steroidal GABA potentiators propofol,
flunitrazepam and pentobarbitone. A similar result was obtained after
pre-incubation of neurones with epicholesterol, the 3alpha-hydroxy
isomer of cholesterol. 3. In contrast, the effects of the steroidal
GABA potentiators pregnanolone and alfaxalone were reduced by cholesterol
enrichment, but not by epicholesterol. Depletion of membrane cholesterol
increased the potentiation of GABA by pregnanolone and alfaxalone
but did not affect the non-steroidal potentiators. 4. The steroidal
antagonist of GABA, pregnenolone sulphate, reduced the maximum response
to GABA. This effect, also, was diminished in cholesterol-enriched
neurones and enhanced in cholesterol-depleted neurones. 5. The effects
of the cholesterol manipulations that were selective for the steroidal
modulators of GABA are suggested to arise from direct interactions
between membrane cholesterol and the GABA(A) receptor. The separate
effects on the non-steroidal potentiators of GABA of cholesterol-enrichment
or addition of epicholesterol to the neurones are suggested to be
due to changes in membrane fluidity. 6. In view of the likely physiological
modulation of GABA(A) receptors by endogenous neuroactive steroids
and evidence of the in vivo lability of membrane cholesterol, the
present observations may have physiological as well as pharmacological
relevance.},

abstract = {The activities of integral membrane proteins are often affected by
the structures of the lipid molecules that surround them in the membrane.
One important parameter is the hydrophobic thickness of the lipid
bilayer, defined by the lengths of the lipid fatty acyl chains. Membrane
proteins are not rigid entities, and deform to ensure good hydrophobic
matching to the surrounding lipid bilayer. The structure of the lipid
headgroup region is likely to be important in defining the structures
of those parts of a membrane protein that are located in the lipid
headgroup region. A number of examples are given where the conformation
of the headgroup-embedded region of a membrane protein changes during
the reaction cycle of the protein; activities of such proteins might
be expected to be particularly sensitive to lipid headgroup structure.
Differences in hydrogen bonding potential and hydration between the
headgroups of phosphatidycholines and phosphatidylethanolamines could
be important factors in determining the effects of these lipids on
protein activities, as well as any effects related to the tendency
of the phosphatidylethanolamines to form a curved, hexagonal H(II)
phase. Effects of lipid structure on protein aggregation and helix-helix
interactions are also discussed, as well as the effects of charged
lipids on ion concentrations close to the surface of the bilayer.
Interpretations of lipid effects in terms of changes in protein volume,
lipid free volume, and curvature frustration are also described.
Finally, the role of non-annular, or 'co-factor' lipids, tightly

have a force field of its own, but is compatible with GROMOS, OPLS,
AMBER, and ENCAD force fields. In addition, it can handle polarizable
shell models and flexible constraints. The program is versatile,
as force routines can be added by the user, tabulated functions can
be specified, and analyses can be easily customized. Nonequilibrium
dynamics and free energy determinations are incorporated. Interfaces
with popular quantum-chemical packages (MOPAC, GAMES-UK, GAUSSIAN)
are provided to perform mixed MM/QM simulations. The package includes
about 100 utility and analysis programs. GROMACS is in the public
domain and distributed (with source code and documentation) under
the GNU General Public License. It is maintained by a group of developers
from the Universities of Groningen, Uppsala, and Stockholm, and the
Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research in Mainz. Its Web site

first insight into the architecture of the family at high resolution,
its detailed investigation was so far prevented by the fact that
activating ligands were unknown. Here we describe a study on the
functional characterization of ELIC by electrophysiology and X-ray
crystallography. ELIC is activated by a class of primary amines that
include the neurotransmitter GABA at high micro- to millimolar concentrations.
The ligands bind to a conserved site and evoke currents that slowly
desensitize over time. The protein forms cation selective channels
with properties that resemble the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.
The high single channel conductance and the comparably simple functional
behavior make ELIC an attractive model system to study general mechanisms
of ion conduction and gating in this important family of neurotransmitter

abstract = {Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) are key players in the
early events of electrical signal transduction at chemical synapses.
The family codes for a structurally conserved scaffold of channel
proteins that open in response to the binding of neurotransmitter
molecules. All proteins share a pentameric organization of identical
or related subunits that consist of an extracellular ligand-binding
domain followed by a transmembrane channel domain. The nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is the most thoroughly studied member
of the pLGIC family (for recent reviews see refs 1-3). Two sources
of structural information provided an architectural framework for
the family. The structure of the soluble acetylcholine-binding protein
(AChBP) defined the organization of the extracellular domain and
revealed the chemical basis of ligand interaction. Electron microscopy
studies of the nAChR from Torpedo electric ray have yielded a picture
of the full-length protein and have recently led to the interpretation
of an electron density map at 4.0 A resolution. Despite the wealth
of experimental information, high-resolution structures of any family
member have so far not been available. Until recently, the pLGICs
were believed to be only expressed in multicellular eukaryotic organisms.
The abundance of prokaryotic genome sequences, however, allowed the
identification of several homologous proteins in bacterial sources.
Here we present the X-ray structure of a prokaryotic pLGIC from the
bacterium Erwinia chrysanthemi (ELIC) at 3.3 A resolution. Our study
reveals the first structure of a pLGIC at high resolution and provides
an important model system for the investigation of the general mechanisms
of ion permeation and gating within the family.},

abstract = {Identification of bacterial and archaeal counterparts to eukaryotic
ion channels has greatly facilitated studies of structural biophysics
of the channels. Often, searches based only on sequence alignment
tools are inadequate for discovering such distant bacterial and archaeal
counterparts. We address the discovery of bacterial and archaeal
members of the Pentameric Ligand-Gated Ion Channel (pLGIC) family
by a combination of four computational methods. One domain-based
method involves retrieval of proteins with pLGIC-relevant domains
by matching those domains to previously established domain templates
in the InterPro family of databases. The second domain-based method
involves searches using ungapped de-novo motifs discovered by MEME
which were trained with well characterized members of the pLGIC family.
The third and fourth methods involve the use of two sequence alignment
search algorithms BLASTp and psiBLAST respectively. The sequences
returned from all methods were screened by having the correct topology
for pLGIC's, and by returning an annotated member of this family
as one of the first ten hits using BLASTp against a comprehensive
database of eukaryotic proteins. We found the domain based searches
to have high specificity but low sensitivity, while the sequence
alignment methods have higher sensitivity but lower specificity.
The four methods together discovered 69 putative bacterial and archaeal
members of the pLGIC family. We ranked and divide the 69 proteins
into groups according to the similarity of their domain compositions
with known eukaryotic pLGIC's. One especially notable group is more
closely related to eukaryotic pLGIC's than to any other known protein
family, and has the overall topology of pLGIC's, but the functional
domains they contain are sufficiently different from those found
in known pLGIC's that they do not score very well against the pLGIC
domain templates. We conclude that multiple methods used in a coordinated
fashion outperform any single method for identifying likely distant
bacterial and archaeal proteins that may provide useful models for
important eukaryotic channel function. We note also that the methods
used here are largely standard and readily accessible. The novelty
is in the effectiveness of a strategy that combines these methods
for identifying bacterial and archea relatives of this family. Therefore
the paper may serve as a template for a broad group of workers to
reliably identify bacterial and archaeal counterparts to eukaryotic
proteins.},

moiety at the 2-position of the glycerol backbone. Fluorescence quenching
studies show that cholesterol-containing phosphatidylcholines can
bind at the lipid-protein interface of the Ca(2+)-ATPase from skeletal

The ATPase activity measured for the ATPase reconstituted with the
cholesterol-containing phosphatidylcholine containing an oleoyl fatty
acyl chain, (C18:1, CHS)PC, is less than that measured for the ATPase
reconstituted with dioleoylphosphatidylcholine. The activity measured
for the ATPase reconstituted with the cholesterol-containing phosphatidylcholine
containing a myristoleoyl fatty acyl chain, (C14:1, CHS)PC, is less
than that measured in (C18:1,CHS)PC and is comparable to that measured
in dimyristoleoylphosphatidylcholine (di(C14: 1)PC. The stoichiometry
of Ca2+ binding to the ATPase is two Ca2+ ions bound per ATPase molecule
in the native membrane or in (C18:1,CHS)PC, but one bound per ATPase
molecule in di(C14:1)PC or (C14: 1,CHS)PC. Addition of cholesterol
to the ATPase in di(C14:1)PC or (C14:1,CHS)PC increases the Ca2+
binding stoichiometry to the usual 2:1, but the binding stoichiometry
remains 1:1 in mixtures of di(C14: 1)PC and (C14:1,CHS)PC. Removal
of Ca2+ from the Ca(2+)-bound ATPase results in a decrease in tryptophan
fluorescence intensity for the ATPase in the native membrane, but
an increase in fluorescence intensity for the ATPase in di(C14:1)PC
or (C14:1,CHS)PC. Addition of cholesterol to the ATPase in di(C14:1)PC

abstract = {The four-alpha-helix bundle mimics the transmembrane domain of the
Cys-loop receptor family believed to be the protein target for general
anesthetics. Using high resolution NMR, we solved the structure (Protein
Data Bank ID: 2I7U) of a prototypical dimeric four-alpha-helix bundle,
(Aalpha(2)-L1M/L38M)(2,) with designed specific binding pockets for
volatile anesthetics. Two monomers of the helix-turn-helix motif
form an antiparallel dimer as originally designed, but the high-resolution
structure exhibits an asymmetric quaternary arrangement of the four
helices. The two helices from the N-terminus to the linker (helices
1 and 1') are associated with each other in the dimer by the side-chain
ring stacking of F12 and W15 along the long hydrophobic core and
by a nearly perfect stretch of hydrophobic interactions between the
complementary pairs of L4, L11, L18, and L25, all of which are located
at the heptad e position along the helix-helix dimer interface. In
comparison, the axes of the two helices from the linker to the C-terminus
(helices 2 and 2') are wider apart from each other, creating a lateral
access pathway around K47 from the aqueous phase to the center of
the designed hydrophobic core. The site of the L38M mutation, which
was previously shown to increase the halothane binding affinity by
approximately 3.5-fold, is not part of the hydrophobic core presumably
involved in the anesthetic binding but shows an elevated transverse
relaxation (R(2)) rate. Qualitative analysis of the protein dynamics
by reduced spectral density mapping revealed exchange contributions
to the relaxation at many residues in the helices. This observation
was confirmed by the quantitative analysis using the Modelfree approach
and by the NMR relaxation dispersion measurements. The NMR structures
and Autodock analysis suggest that the pocket with the most favorable
amphipathic property for anesthetic binding is located between the
W15 side chains at the center of the dimeric hydrophobic core, with
the possibility of two additional minor binding sites between the
F12 and F52 ring stacks of each monomer. The high-resolution structure
of the designed anesthetic-binding protein offers unprecedented atomistic
details about possible sites for anesthetic-protein interactions
that are essential to the understanding of molecular mechanisms of
general anesthesia.},

abstract = {Cys-loop receptors constitute a superfamily of ion channels gated
by ligands such as acetylcholine, serotonin, glycine, and ?-aminobutyric
acid. All of these receptors are thought to share structural characteristics,
but due to high sequence variation and limited structure availability,
our knowledge about allosteric binding sites is still limited. These
sites are frequent targets of anesthetic and alcohol molecules, and
are of high pharmacological importance. We used molecular simulations
to study ethanol binding and equilibrium exchange for the homomeric
?1 glycine receptor (GlyR?1), modeled on the structure of the Gloeobacter
violaceus pentameric ligand-gated channel. Ethanol has a well-known
potentiating effect and can be used in high concentrations. By performing
two microsecond-scale simulations of GlyR with/without ethanol, we
were able to observe spontaneous binding in cavities and equilibrium
ligand exchange. Of interest, it appears that there are ethanol-binding
sites both between and within the GlyR transmembrane subunits, with
the intersubunit site having the highest occupancy and slowest exchange
(200ns). This model site involves several residues that were previously
identified via mutations as being crucial for potentiation. Finally,
ethanol appears to stabilize the GlyR model built on a presumably
open form of the ligand-gated channel. This stabilization could help
explain the effects of allosteric ligand binding in Cys-loop receptors.},

abstract = {The molecular nature of the site of general anaesthesia has long been
sought through the process of comparing the in vivo potencies of
general anaesthetics with their physical properties, particularly
their ability to dissolve in solvents of various polarities. This
approach has led to the conclusion that the site of general anaesthesia
is largely apolar but contains a strong polar component. However,
there is growing evidence that several physiological targets underlie
general anaesthesia, and that different agents may act selectively
on subsets of these targets. Consequently research now focuses on
the details of general-anaesthetic-protein interactions. There are
large amounts of structural data that identify cavities where anaesthetics
bind on soluble proteins that are readily crystallizable. These proteins
serve as models, having no role in anaesthesia. Two problems make
studies of the more likely targets--excitable membrane proteins--difficult.
One is that they rarely crystallize and the other is that the sites
have their highest affinity for general anaesthetics when the channels
are in the open state. Such states rarely exist for more than tens
of milliseconds. Crystallographers are making progress with the first
problem, whilst anaesthesia researchers have developed a number of
strategies for addressing the second. Some of these (kinetic analysis,
site-directed mutagenesis) provide indirect evidence for sites and
their nature, whilst others seek direct identification of sites by
employing newly developed general anaesthetics that are photoaffinity
labels. Such studies on acetylcholine, glycine and GABA receptors
point to the existence of sites located within the plane of the membrane
either within the ion channel lumen (acetylcholine receptor), or
on the outer side of the alpha-helix lining that lumen (GABAA and
glycine receptors). Bound anaesthetics generally exert their actions
on ion channels by binding to allosteric sites whose topology varies
from one conformation to another, but definitive proof for this mechanism
remains elusive.},

Following the earlier approach of Cornell et al., the charge set
was obtained by fitting to the electrostatic potentials of dipeptides
calculated using B3LYP/cc-pVTZ//HF/6-31G** quantum mechanical methods.
The main-chain torsion parameters were obtained by fitting to the

using MP2/cc-pVTZ//HF/6-31G** quantum mechanical methods. All other
parameters were taken from the existing AMBER data base. The major
departure from previous force fields is that all quantum mechanical
calculations were done in the condensed phase with continuum solvent
models and an effective dielectric constant of epsilon = 4. We anticipate
that this force field parameter set will address certain critical
short comings of previous force fields in condensed-phase simulations
of proteins. Initial tests on peptides demonstrated a high-degree
of similarity between the calculated and the statistically measured
Ramanchandran maps for both Ace-Gly-Nme and Ace-Ala-Nme di-peptides.
Some highlights of our results include (1) well-preserved balance
between the extended and helical region distributions, and (2) favorable

Backward compatibility between the new and Cornell et al. charge

the chemical specificity of sterols. Affinity-purified nAcChoRs from
Torpedo were reconstituted into bilayers at mole ratios of 58:12:30
[1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC)/1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate
(DOPA)/steroid]. When the enantiomer of cholesterol was used, or
when the stereochemistry at the 3-hydroxy group was changed from
beta to alpha by substituting epicholesterol for cholesterol, activation
was still supported. The importance of cholesterol's planar ring
structure was tested by comparing planar cholestanol (5alpha-cholestan-3beta-ol)
with nonplanar coprostanol (5beta-cholestan-3beta-ol). Both supported
activation. Thus, these steroids support activation independent of
structural features known to be important for modulation of lipid
bilayer properties. This provides indirect support for a steroid
binding site possessing very lax structural requirements.},

abstract = {General anesthetics depress central nervous system excitability via
a mechanism that probably involves effects on synaptic ion channels,
but the fundamental molecular nature of the site where they act is
unknown. Although the importance of hydrophobicity for general anesthetic
drug potency has long been established, it remains uncertain whether
these "nonspecific" drugs act on membrane proteins directly or by
modification of the physical properties of the lipid membrane or
the lipid-protein interface. We find that specific mutations in the
acetylcholine receptor pore-forming M2 domains enhance the sensitivity
of the receptor to the general anesthetics isoflurane, hexanol, and
octanol, suggesting that these agents act by binding directly to
a discrete protein site at or near these residues. The sensitivity
of the receptor to block by general anesthetics increases with increased
hydrophobicity of these residues, demonstrating that hydrophobic
forces dominate the interaction of drugs with their protein site.
Furthermore, octanol inhibits both wild-type and mutant nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors preferentially after channel opening, which
is consistent with a mechanism where drugs bind within the receptor's
pore. Similar sites on postsynaptic ion channels in brain may represent
general anesthetic targets for modulating consciousness.},

exchange spectra provide insight into both the overall rates and
extent of peptide 1H/2H exchange and the individual rates and extent
to which peptide hydrogens in alpha-helix and beta-sheet conformations
exchange for deuterium. The spectra are also sensitive to the conformation
of the polypeptide backbone and thus the secondary structure of the
nAChR. The various spectral features monitored in the presence and
absence of carbamylcholine and tetracaine are essentially identical,
indicating that there are no large net changes in secondary structure
in the channel-inactive desensitized state. The various spectral
features monitored for the nAChR reconstituted into lipid membranes
either with or without cholesterol are very similar, indicating that
cholesterol is not a major structural regulator of the nAChR. However,
in the absence of both cholesterol and anionic lipids, there is a
slightly enhanced rate of exchange of alpha-helical peptide hydrogens
for deuterium that occurs as a result of either an increase in nAChR
dynamics or an increase in the accessibility of transmembrane peptide
hydrogens to 2H2O. The latter may simply be due to an increase in
the "fluidity" and thus permeability of the lipid bilayers to aqueous

beta(2) subunit in dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles by (1)H and
(15)N solution-state NMR. Both 1-chloro-1,2,2-trifluorocyclobutane
(F3) and isoflurane, two volatile general anesthetics, induced nonuniform
changes in chemical shifts among residues in TM2e. Saturation transfer
difference NMR experiments further confirmed the direct anesthetic
interaction with TM2e. A significant and more specific anesthetic
interaction was observed on three leucine residues at the helix C-terminus.
Although the TM2e helical structure remained after addition of anesthetics,
plausible shortening and lengthening of helix hydrogen bonds were
evidenced by periodic changes in backbone amide chemical shifts.
The TM2e backbone dynamics were determined on the basis of the (15)N
relaxation rate constants, R(1) and R(2), and the (15)N-[(1)H] NOE
using the model-free approach. The global tumbling time (11.7 ns)
of TM2e in micelles slightly increased ( approximately 12.3-12.5
ns) in the presence of anesthetics. The order parameter, S(2), exceeded
0.9 for all (15)N-labeled residues, showing a restricted internal
motion. Anesthetics appear to have minor effect on the TM2e's internal
motion. This study provided the basis for subsequent more comprehensive
studies of anesthetic effects on the transmembrane domain complex

photoreactive etomidate analog ([(3)H]azietomidate), which retains
anesthetic potency in vivo and enhances GABA(A)R function in vitro,
to identify directly, for the first time, amino acids that contribute
to a GABA(A)R anesthetic binding site. For GABA(A)Rs purified by
affinity chromatography from detergent extracts of bovine cortex,
[(3)H]azietomidate photoincorporation was increased by GABA and inhibited
by etomidate in a concentration-dependent manner (IC(50) = 30 microm).
Protein microsequencing of fragments isolated from proteolytic digests
established photolabeling of two residues: one within the alphaM1
transmembrane helix at alpha1Met-236 (and/or the homologous methionines
in alpha2,3,5), not previously implicated in etomidate function,
and one within the betaM3 transmembrane helix at beta3Met-286 (and/or
the homologous methionines in beta1,2), an etomidate sensitivity
determinant. The pharmacological specificity of labeling indicates
that these methionines contribute to a single binding pocket for
etomidate located in the transmembrane domain at the interface between
beta and alpha subunits, in what is predicted by structural models
based on homology with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor to be
a water-filled pocket approximately 50 A below the GABA binding site.
The localization of the etomidate binding site to an intersubunit,
not an intrasubunit, binding pocket is a novel conclusion that suggests
more generally that the localization of drug binding sites to subunit
interfaces may be a feature not only for GABA and benzodiazepines
but also for etomidate and other intravenous and volatile anesthetics.},

abstract = {Controlling neuronal excitability is vitally important for maintaining
a healthy central nervous system (CNS) and this relies on the activity
of type A gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) neurotransmitter receptors.
Given this role, it is therefore important to understand how these
receptors are regulated by endogenous modulators in the brain and
determine where they bind to the receptor. One of the most potent
groups of modulators is the neurosteroids which regulate the activity
of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors. This level of regulation
is thought to be physiologically important and its dysfunction may
be relevant to numerous neurological conditions. The aim of this
review is to summarise those studies that over the last 20 years
have focussed upon finding the binding sites for neurosteroids on
GABA(A) receptors. We consider the nature of steroid binding sites
in other proteins where this has been determined at atomic resolution
and how their generic features were mapped onto GABA(A) receptors
to help locate 2 putative steroid binding sites. Altogether, the
findings strongly suggest that neurosteroids do bind to discrete
sites on the GABA(A) receptor and that these are located within the
transmembrane domains of alpha and beta receptor subunits. The implications
for neurosteroid binding to other inhibitory receptors such as glycine
and GABA(C) receptors are also considered. Identifying neurosteroid
binding sites may enable the precise pathophysiological role(s) of
neurosteroids in the CNS to be established for the first time, as
well as providing opportunities for the design of novel drug entities.},

were purified from the electric organ of Torpedo marmorata. Their
lipid composition is essentially characterized by the prominence
of cholesterol, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine,
long-chain fatty acyl constituents, and the absence of sphingomyelin.
Solubilised receptor was purified from these fragments and the concentration
of sodium cholate lowered by dialysis to 0.01{\%} (w/v). When this
preparation was injected under a lipid monolayer, an increase of
surface pressure developed, which was not observed with the detergent
alone nor in the absence of lipid film. When covalently radiolabelled
receptor preparations were injected at a constant surface pressure
the radioactivity recovered with the film was proportional to the
increase in area. It is concluded that the pressure or area increases
are due to the penetration of the cholinergic receptor protein into
the lipid film. Incorporation experiments into films formed from
various pure lipids showed that the protein interacts more readily
with cholesterol than with ergosterol, phosphatidylcholine, or other
phospholipids. Its affinity is also higher for long-chain phosphatidylcholines
than for short-chain ones. The degree of unsaturation and fluidity
of the 3-sn-phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) films are of secondary
importance. Parallel experiments with covalently and non-covalently
labelled receptor preparations showed that part of the protein recovered
with the film lost its alpha-toxin binding ability during the penetration.

known as Cys-loop receptors) are a superfamily of proteins that include
the receptors for major neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine,
serotonin, glycine, GABA, glutamate and histamine, and for Zn2+ ions.
They play a central role in fast synaptic signaling in animal nervous
systems and so far have not been found outside of the Metazoa.Using
sensitive sequence-profile searches we have identified homologs of
ART-LGICs in several bacteria and a single archaeal genus, Methanosarcina.
The homology between the animal receptors and the prokaryotic homologs
spans the entire length of the former, including both the ligand-binding
and channel-forming transmembrane domains. A sequence-structure analysis
using the structure of Lymnaea stagnalis acetylcholine-binding protein
and the newly detected prokaryotic versions indicates the presence
of at least one aromatic residue in the ligand-binding boxes of almost
all representatives of the superfamily. Investigation of the domain
architectures of the bacterial forms shows that they may often show
fusions with other small-molecule-binding domains, such as the periplasmic
binding protein superfamily I (PBP-I), Cache and MCP-N domains. Some
of the bacterial forms also occur in predicted operons with the genes
of the PBP-II superfamily and the Cache domains. Analysis of phyletic
patterns suggests that the ART-LGICs are currently absent in all
other eukaryotic lineages except animals. Moreover, phylogenetic
analysis and conserved sequence motifs also suggest that a subset
of the bacterial forms is closer to the metazoan forms.From the information
from the bacterial forms we infer that cation-pi or hydrophobic interactions
with the ligand are likely to be a pervasive feature of the entire
superfamily, even though the individual residues involved in the
process may vary. The conservation pattern in the channel-forming
transmembrane domains also suggests similar channel-gating mechanisms
in the prokaryotic versions. From the distribution of charged residues
in the prokaryotic M2 transmembrane segments, we expect that there
will be examples of both cation and anion selectivity within the
prokaryotic members. Contextual connections suggest that the prokaryotic
forms may function as chemotactic receptors for low molecular weight
solutes. The phyletic patterns and phylogenetic relationships suggest
the possibility that the metazoan receptors emerged through an early
lateral transfer from a prokaryotic source, before the divergence
of extant metazoan lineages.},

@article{Fong1987,
abstract = {Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to study the
secondary structure of purified Torpedo californica nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor (AChR) in reconstituted membranes. Functional studies have
previously demonstrated that the ion channel activity requires the
presence of both sterol and negatively charged phospholipids in membranes.
The present studies are designed to test the hypothesis that the
alpha-helical structure of AChR may be stabilized by specific lipid
molecules (sterol and/or negatively charged phospholipids) and that
these alpha-helices may be responsible for the formation of a potential
ion channel. FTIR data show statistically significant (p less than
0.005) spectral changes due to cholesterol and negatively charged
phospholipids, respectively. On the basis of standard curves describing
the relationship between the spectral properties and the secondary
structural contents of water-soluble proteins, the observed spectral
change at 931 cm-1 can be interpreted as an apparent change in the
alpha-helix content from about 17{\%} in the absence of sterols to
about 20{\%} in the presence of sterols, suggesting that protein-sterol
interactions increase the helical structure of the AChR molecule.
Similarly, the spectral change at 988 cm-1 can be interpreted as
an apparent increase of beta-sheet content in the AChR molecule from
about 20{\%} to about 24{\%} due to the presence of negatively charged
phospholipids. Functional AChR in membranes thus appears to be correlated
with higher alpha-helical and beta-sheet contents. It is concluded
that one role of specific interactions between membrane protein and
lipid molecules may be to maintain specific secondary structures
necessary to support the ion channel function of AChR.},

abstract = {ELIC, the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel from Erwinia chrysanthemi,
is a prototype for Cys-loop receptors. Here we show that acetylcholine
is a competitive antagonist for ELIC. We determine the acetylcholine-ELIC
cocrystal structure to a 2.9-{\AA} resolution and find that acetylcholine
binding to an aromatic cage at the subunit interface induces a significant
contraction of loop C and other structural rearrangements in the
extracellular domain. The side chain of the pore-lining residue F247
reorients and the pore size consequently enlarges, but the channel
remains closed. We attribute the inability of acetylcholine to activate
ELIC primarily to weak cation-$\pi$ and electrostatic interactions in
the pocket, because an acetylcholine derivative with a simple quaternary-to-tertiary
ammonium substitution activates the channel. This study presents
a compelling case for understanding the structural underpinning of
the functional relationship between agonism and competitive antagonism
in the Cys-loop receptors, providing a new framework for developing
novel therapeutic drugs.},

@article{Unwin1993,
abstract = {The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is a cation-selective, ligand-gated
ion channel, involved in signal transmission at the chemical synapse.
This paper reports the three-dimensional appearance of the channel
in the closed conformation, at 9 A resolution. The structure was
determined by electron microscopy of tubular crystals of Torpedo
postsynaptic membranes embedded in amorphous ice. The analysis was
carried out by averaging data from separate images, using helical
diffraction methods. The images were recorded over a wide range of
defocus (7000 to 18,800 A) so that all spacings in the object were
well sampled. Tubes of only one kind ((-16.6) helical family) were
processed, so that the Fourier terms could be averaged directly in
reciprocal space. The three-dimensional map, obtained from 26 images,
resolves some elements of secondary structure within the five protein
subunits. In the synaptic part of each subunit, about 30 A from the
bilayer surface, there is a group of three rods that are oriented
predominantly perpendicular to the plane of the bilayer and twist
around each other as in a left-handed coil. These rods presumably
are alpha-helices. Two of them line the entrance to the channel,
and the third is on the outside. The distinctive appearance of the
alpha subunits in this region suggests that the rods may be involved
in forming the binding pocket for acetylcholine. In the bilayer-spanning
part of each subunit there is only one rod clearly visible, which
forms the wall lining the pore, and so is assumed to be the transmembrane
helix, M2. This rod does not form a straight path through the lipid
bilayer, but bends, or kinks, near its mid-point, where it is closest
to the axis of the pore, and tilts radially outwards on either side.
It is flanked on the lipid-facing sides by a continuous rim of density,
which seems likely to be composed of beta-sheet. A tentative alignment
is made between the three-dimensional densities and the sequence
of M2, based on correlation of the appearance of the rods with a
special pattern of amino acid residues in the sequence. This alignment
places the charged groups at the ends of M2 symmetrically on either
side of the bilayer, and a highly conserved leucine residue (Leu251
of the alpha subunit) at the level of the kink.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED

abstract = {The reconstruction of the purified sodium- and chloride-coupled gamma-aminobutyric
acid transporter from rat brain into asolectin liposomes requires
the addition of brain lipids (Radian, R., and Kanner, B. I. (1985)
J. Biol. Chem. 260, 11859-11865). The reconstitution assay was used
to identify the component(s) from brain lipids responsible for the
stimulation during the fractionation of brain lipids. The distribution
of the active component was found to be similar to that of cholesterol.
Furthermore, cholesterol was found to mimic the effect of brain lipids
and it stimulated the transport activity up to 20-fold. Optimal reconstituted
transport activity was achieved with mixtures of cholesterol and
any one of several phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine
or phosphatidylglycerol. gamma-Aminobutyric acid transport in these
liposomes of defined composition exhibited all the properties of
the native transporter, such as the absolute dependence on sodium
and chloride and electrogenicity. Cholesterol could not be replaced
by cholest-4-en-3one and other steroids, and thus its effect is probably
not due to effects on membrane fluidity. The requirement was also
not due to effects on intactness of the liposomes or incorporation
of proteins into them. Furthermore it was found that the reconstitution
of the sodium and potassium coupled L-glutamic acid transporter from
rat brain also required cholesterol. However, in this case the optimal
activity was reached by 4-5-fold lower levels of cholesterol than
those necessary for gamma-aminobutyric acid transport. When cholesterol
depletion from the transporters was incomplete, addition of exogenous
brain lipids was not required. Thus, if the cholesterol was still
associated with the transporter proteins, its final concentration,
as a fraction of the total lipids present in the reconstitution mixture,
was only about 0.01 mol{\%}. Thus, it is likely that the effects of
cholesterol are due to direct interactions with the cotransporters
and not to an average effect on membrane properties.},

human alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor using molecular dynamics
simulation and analyses of root mean-square fluctuations, block partitioning
of segmental motion, and principal component analysis. The results
reveal flexible regions and concerted global motions of the subunits
encompassing extracellular and transmembrane domains of the subunits.
The most relevant motions comprise a bending, hinged at the beta10-M1
region, accompanied by concerted tilting of the M2 helices that widens
the intracellular end of the channel. Despite the nanosecond timescale,
the observations suggest that tilting of the M2 helices may initiate
opening of the pore. The results also reveal direct coupling between
a twisting motion of the extracellular domain and dynamic changes
of M2. Covariance analysis of interresidue motions shows that this
coupling arises through a network of residues within the Cys and
M2-M3 loops where Phe135 is stabilized within a hydrophobic pocket
formed by Leu270 and Ile271. The resulting concerted motion causes
a downward shift of the M2 helices that disrupts a hydrophobic girdle
formed by 9' and 13' residues.},

abstract = {Alcoholism is a complex disease with both genetic and environmental
risk factors. To identify genes that affect the risk for alcoholism,
we systematically ascertained and carefully assessed individuals
in families with multiple alcoholics. Linkage and association analyses
suggested that a region of chromosome 4p contained genes affecting
a quantitative endophenotype, brain oscillations in the beta frequency
range (13-28 Hz), and the risk for alcoholism. To identify the individual
genes that affect these phenotypes, we performed linkage disequilibrium
analyses of 69 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) within a cluster
of four GABA(A) receptor genes, GABRG1, GABRA2, GABRA4, and GABRB1,
at the center of the linked region. GABA(A) receptors mediate important
effects of alcohol and also modulate beta frequencies. Thirty-one
SNPs in GABRA2, but only 1 of the 20 SNPs in the flanking genes,
showed significant association with alcoholism. Twenty-five of the
GABRA2 SNPs, but only one of the SNPs in the flanking genes, were
associated with the brain oscillations in the beta frequency. The
region of strongest association with alcohol dependence extended
from intron 3 past the 3' end of GABRA2; all 43 of the consecutive
three-SNP haplotypes in this region of GABRA2 were highly significant.
A three-SNP haplotype was associated with alcoholism, with P=.000000022.
No coding differences were found between the high-risk and low-risk
haplotypes, suggesting that the effect is mediated through gene regulation.
The very strong association of GABRA2 with both alcohol dependence
and the beta frequency of the electroencephalogram, combined with
biological evidence for a role of this gene in both phenotypes, suggest
that GABRA2 might influence susceptibility to alcohol dependence
by modulating the level of neural excitation.},

METHODS:: The structure of the torpedo acetylcholine receptor (nAChR$\alpha$),
the structures of the $\alpha$4 and $\beta$2 subunits of the human nAChR, the
structures of the eukaryotic glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl),
and the prokaryotic pH-sensing channels, from Gloeobacter violaceus
and Erwinia chrysanthemi, were aligned with the SAlign and 3DMA algorithms.
A multiple sequence alignment from these structures and those of
the GABAaR was performed with ClustalW. The Modeler and Rosetta algorithms
independently created three-dimensional constructs of the GABAaR
from the GluCl template. The CDocker algorithm docked a congeneric
series of propofol derivatives into the binding pocket and scored
calculated binding affinities for correlation with known GABAaR potentiation
EC50s. RESULTS:: Multiple structure alignments of templates revealed
a clear consensus of residue locations relevant to anesthetic effects
except for torpedo nAChR. Within the GABAaR models generated from
GluCl, the residues notable for modulating anesthetic action within
transmembrane segments 1, 2, and 3 converged on the intersubunit
interface between $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits. Docking scores of a propofol
derivative series into this binding site showed strong linear correlation
with GABAaR potentiation EC50. CONCLUSION:: Consensus structural
alignment based on homologous templates revealed an intersubunit
anesthetic binding cavity within the transmembrane domain of the
GABAaR, which showed a correlation of ligand docking scores with
experimentally measured GABAaR potentiation.},

from suspensions of Torpedo marmorata receptor-rich vesicles. They
are composed of pairs of oppositely oriented molecules arranged on
the surface lattice with the symmetry of the plane group p2 (average
unit cell dimensions: a = 90 A, b = 162 A, gamma = 117 degrees).
The receptor in this lattice has an asymmetric distribution of mass
around its perimeter, yet a regular pentagonal shape; thus its five
transmembrane subunits appear to have different lengths, but approximately
equal cross sections. The tubes grow by lateral aggregation on the
vesicle surface of ribbons of the paired molecules. Both ribbons
and tubes were sensitive to dispersal by the disulphide reductant,
dithiothreitol. This observation and other evidence suggest that
the basic pairing interaction in the tubes may be that of the physiological
dimer, involving contact between delta-subunits.},

abstract = {The modulatory effect of cholesterol on the function of two structurally
related peptide receptors, the oxytocin receptor and the brain cholecystokinin
receptor in plasma membranes as well as in intact cells, was analyzed.
Different approaches for cholesterol modification were applied: (i)
depletion and reloading of cholesterol mediated by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin
and cholesterol-methyl-beta-cyclodextrin, respectively, in a reversible
manner; (ii) mild treatment of the plasma membranes with cholesterol
oxidase under control of the membrane fluidity as measured by fluorescence
anisotropy of diphenylhexatriene; and (iii) filipin pretreatment
of membranes. The results allowed us to distinguish two mechanisms
of cholesterol affecting the ligand-binding function of receptors:
changes of the membrane fluidity as demonstrated for the cholecystokinin
receptor, or a putatively specific cholesterol-receptor interaction
as shown for the oxytocin receptor. This was confirmed in a structure-activity
analysis with a variety of sterol analogues substituting for cholesterol
in the membranes. While the agonist binding of the cholecystokinin
receptor was supported by each of the tested steroids and was well
correlated with the corresponding fluorescence anisotropy values,
a stringent and unique requirement of the oxytocin receptor's affinity
state for structural features of the sterol molecule was found. The
molecular requirements differ both from those postulated for sterol-phospholipid
interactions and from those known to be necessary for the functional
activity of other proteins. The different behavior of both peptide
receptors concerning the cholesterol dependence of their ligand binding
was also present in vivo at the level of signal transduction. The
results suggest that cholesterol can modulate receptor function by
two distinct mechanisms, by changes of the membrane fluidity, and/or
by a highly specific molecular interaction.},

within transmembrane 4-alpha-helix bundles of neurotransmitter receptors,

elusive. To provide such detail, we screened soluble proteins containing
this structural motif, and found only one that exhibited evidence
of strong anesthetic binding. Ferritin is a 24-mer of 4-alpha-helix
bundles; both halothane and isoflurane bind with K(A) values of approximately
10(5) M(-1), higher than any previously reported inhaled anesthetic-protein
interaction. The crystal structures of the halothane/apoferritin
and isoflurane/apoferritin complexes were determined at 1.75 A resolution,
revealing a common anesthetic binding pocket within an interhelical
dimerization interface. The high affinity is explained by several
weak polar contacts and an optimal host/guest packing relationship.
Neither the acidic protons nor ether oxygen of the anesthetics contribute
to the binding interaction. Compared with unliganded apoferritin,
the anesthetic produced no detectable alteration of structure or
B factors. The remarkably high affinity of the anesthetic/apoferritin
complex implies greater selectivity of protein sites than previously
thought, and suggests that direct protein actions may underlie effects
at lower than surgical levels of anesthetic, including loss of awareness.},

are strongly supported by mutagenesis data for picrotoxinin and lindane,
which are less potent in a T2'S version of GLIC. Overall, our data

modulated by the endogenous neurosteroids, allopregnanolone and tetrahydro-deoxycorticosterone.
Neurosteroids are synthesized de novo in the brain during stress,
pregnancyand after ethanol consumption, and disrupted steroid regulation
of GABAergic transmission is strongly implicated in several debilitating
conditions such as panic disorder, major depression, schizophrenia,
alcohol dependence and catamenial epilepsy. Determining how neurosteroids
interact with the GABA(A) receptor is a prerequisite for understanding
their physiological and pathophysiological roles in the brain. Here
we identify two discrete binding sites in the receptor's transmembrane
domains that mediate the potentiating and direct activation effects
of neurosteroids. They potentiate GABA responses from a cavity formed
by the alpha-subunit transmembrane domains, whereas direct receptor
activation is initiated by interfacial residues between alpha and
beta subunits and is enhanced by steroid binding to the potentiation
site. Thus, significant receptor activation by neurosteroids relies
on occupancy of both the activation and potentiation sites. These
sites are highly conserved throughout the GABA(A )receptor family,
and their identification provides a unique opportunity for the development
of new therapeutic, neurosteroid-based ligands and transgenic disease
models of neurosteroid dysfunction.},

four-alpha-helix bundle, (Aalpha(2)-L1M/L38M)(2), was designed to
contain a long hydrophobic core, enclosed by four amphipathic alpha-helices,
for specific anesthetic binding. The structural and dynamical analyses
of (Aalpha(2)-L1M/L38M)(2) in the absence of anesthetics (another
study) showed a highly dynamic antiparallel dimer with an asymmetric
arrangement of the four helices and a lateral accessing pathway from
the aqueous phase to the hydrophobic core. In this study, we determined
the high-resolution NMR structure of (Aalpha(2)-L1M/L38M)(2) in the
presence of halothane, a clinically used volatile anesthetic. The
high-solution NMR structure, with a backbone root mean-square deviation
of 1.72 A (2JST), and the NMR binding measurements revealed that
the primary halothane binding site is located between two side-chains
of W15 from each monomer, different from the initially designed anesthetic
binding sites. Hydrophobic interactions with residues A44 and L18
also contribute to stabilizing the bound halothane. Whereas halothane
produces minor changes in the monomer structure, the quaternary arrangement
of the dimer is shifted by about half a helical turn and twists relative
to each other, which leads to the closure of the lateral access pathway
to the hydrophobic core. Quantitative dynamics analyses, including
Modelfree analysis of the relaxation data and the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill
transverse relaxation dispersion measurements, suggest that the most
profound anesthetic effect is the suppression of the conformational
exchange both near and remote from the binding site. Our results
revealed a novel mechanism of an induced fit between anesthetic molecule
and its protein target, with the direct consequence of protein dynamics
changing on a global rather than a local scale. This mechanism may
be universal to anesthetic action on neuronal proteins.},

abstract = {General anaesthetics have enjoyed long and widespread use but their
molecular mechanism of action remains poorly understood. There is
good evidence that their principal targets are pentameric ligand-gated
ion channels (pLGICs) such as inhibitory GABA(A) (?-aminobutyric
acid) receptors and excitatory nicotinic acetylcholine receptors,
which are respectively potentiated and inhibited by general anaesthetics.
The bacterial homologue from Gloeobacter violaceus (GLIC), whose
X-ray structure was recently solved, is also sensitive to clinical
concentrations of general anaesthetics. Here we describe the crystal
structures of the complexes propofol/GLIC and desflurane/GLIC. These
reveal a common general-anaesthetic binding site, which pre-exists
in the apo-structure in the upper part of the transmembrane domain
of each protomer. Both molecules establish van der Waals interactions
with the protein; propofol binds at the entrance of the cavity whereas
the smaller, more flexible, desflurane binds deeper inside. Mutations
of some amino acids lining the binding site profoundly alter the
ionic response of GLIC to protons, and affect its general-anaesthetic
pharmacology. Molecular dynamics simulations, performed on the wild
type (WT) and two GLIC mutants, highlight differences in mobility
of propofol in its binding site and help to explain these effects.
These data provide a novel structural framework for the design of
general anaesthetics and of allosteric modulators of brain pLGICs.},

subunit fragments isolated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide

at 254 nm for 60 s in the presence of 1 mM [(14)C]halothane resulted
in incorporation of approximately 0.5 mol of (14)C/mol of subunit,
with photolabeling distributed within the nAChR extracellular and

A was not. Within the transmembrane domain, alphaTyr-213 within alphaM1

Although the efficiency of photolabeling at the subunit level was
unaffected by agonist, competitive antagonist, or isoflurane, state-dependent
photolabeling was seen in a delta subunit fragment beginning at deltaPhe-206.
Labeling of deltaTyr-212 in the extracellular domain was inhibited

refined structure was derived to an R-factor of 36.7{\%} (R(free) 37.9{\%})
by standard crystallographic methods, after placing the densities
corresponding to a single molecule into an artificial unit cell.
The agreement between experimental and calculated phases along the

and to give an independent measure of the accuracy. The atomic model
allowed a detailed description of the whole receptor in the closed-channel
form, including the ligand-binding and intracellular domains, which
have not previously been interpreted at a chemical level. We confirm
that the two ligand-binding alpha subunits have a different extended
conformation from the three other subunits in the closed channel,
and identify several interactions on both pairs of subunit interfaces,
and within the alpha subunits, which may be responsible for their
"distorted" structures. The ACh-coordinating amino acid side-chains
of the alpha subunits are far apart in the closed channel, indicating
that a localised rearrangement, involving closure of loops B and
C around the bound ACh molecule, occurs upon activation. A comparison
of the structure of the alpha subunit with that of AChBP having ligand
present, suggests how the localised rearrangement overcomes the distortions
and initiates the rotational movements associated with opening of
the channel. Both vestibules of the channel are strongly electronegative,
providing a cation-stabilising environment at either entrance of
the membrane pore. Access to the pore on the intracellular side is
further influenced by narrow lateral windows, which would be expected
to screen out electrostatically ions of the wrong charge and size.},

abstract = {This short overview addresses the effects of cholesterol (Chol) on
the stability, supramolecular organization, and function of the murine
muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR). The biophysical
properties of Chol-AChR interaction are discussed first, as they
constitute, in our view, the very source of the modulation exerted
by Chol on receptor structure and function. In the absence of innervation,
AChRs occur in the form of aggregates that remain stable at the cell-surface
membrane of mammalian model cells over a period of hours. Acute Chol
depletion drastically reduces (approximately 50{\%}) the number of
receptor aggregates by accelerating the rate of endocytosis in a
receptor-expressing clonal cell line. Chol depletion also results
in ion channel gain-of-function of the remaining cell-surface AChRs,
whereas Chol enrichment has the opposite effect. Wide-field and confocal
microscopy show AChR clusters as diffraction-limited puncta of approximately
200 nm diameter. Stimulated emission depletion fluorescence microscopy
resolves these puncta into nanoclusters with an average diameter
of approximately 55 nm. Exploiting the enhanced resolution, the effect
of acute Chol depletion is shown to alter the short- and long-range
organization of AChR nanoclusters. In the short range, the 50{\%} AChRs
remaining at the cell surface form larger nanoclusters. On larger
scales (0.5-3.5 microm) Ripley's K-test on stimulated emission depletion
images reveal changes in nanocluster distribution, attributable to
the Chol-related abolition of cytoskeletal physical barriers normally
preventing the lateral diffusion of AChR nanoclusters. We discuss
these observations in the light of the so-called 'raft' hypothesis
and surmise that Chol content at the plasmalemma homeostatically
modulates cell-surface organization and stability of receptor nanodomains
and fine tunes receptor channel function to temporarily compensate
for acute AChR loss from the cell surface.},

genes of GABA(A) receptor. Five SNPs in GABRB2, namely B2I7G1584T,
rs1816071, rs194072, rs252944 and rs187269, were found to be significantly
associated, and their haplotypes in linkage disequilibrium, with
schizophrenia. This represents the first report on any disease association
of SNPs in the human GABA(A) receptor genes, and focuses attention
on the GABAergic hypothesis of schizophrenia etiology.},

in acutely dissociated rat hippocampal neurones, using the whole-cell
patch clamp technique. Neuronal cholesterol was manipulated within
the range 56-250{\%} control by incubation with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin
for depletion and a complex of cholesterol and methyl-beta-cyclodextrin
for enrichment. Manipulation over a narrower range was achieved with
cholesterol + phosphatidylcholine liposomes. A complex of epicholesterol
and methyl-beta-cyclodextrin was used to insert epicholesterol. Cholesterol
enrichment reduced the potency of GABA, as did cholesterol depletion,
with increases in EC(50) of up to 4-fold. Cholesterol enrichment
reduced the potency of the competitive antagonist bicuculline but
did not affect that of the non-competitive antagonist picrotoxinin.
Cholesterol depletion did not affect the potencies of either antagonist.
Epicholesterol substituted functionally for cholesterol with respect
to the effects of enrichment. In cholesterol-depleted neurones, however,
only incubation with cholesterol was able to restore GABA potency
to normal. These results suggest a specific requirement for cholesterol
at control levels to maintain optimal GABA potency, which may involve
specific binding of cholesterol to the GABA(A) receptor. The reduction
in GABA potency by enrichment with cholesterol or epicholesterol
is more likely to be due to reduced plasma membrane fluidity.},

hydrophobic interior. Energy transfer was found to occur from tryptophan
in the acetylcholine receptor to cysteine-bound pyrene with a distance
of separation of approximately 18 A. However, there was no energy
transfer when pyrene-labeled AChR was reconstituted into membranes

the fluorophore(s) responsible for energy transfer are located in

(GABA(A)R) with an etomidate analog and mutational analyses of direct
activation of GABA(A)R by neurosteroids have each led to the proposal
that these structurally distinct general anesthetics bind to sites
in GABA(A)Rs in the transmembrane domain at the interface between
the beta and alpha subunits. We tested whether the two ligand binding
sites might overlap by examining whether neuroactive steroids inhibited
etomidate analog photolabeling. We previously identified (Li, G.
D., Chiara, D. C., Sawyer, G. W., Husain, S. S., Olsen, R. W., and
Cohen, J. B. (2006) J. Neurosci. 26, 11599-11605) azietomidate photolabeling
of GABA(A)R alpha1Met-236 and betaMet-286 (in alphaM1 and betaM3).
Positioning these two photolabeled amino acids in a single type of
binding site at the interface of beta and alpha subunits (two copies
per pentamer) is consistent with a GABA(A)R homology model based
upon the structure of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and with
recent alphaM1 to betaM3 cross-linking data. Biologically active
neurosteroids enhance rather than inhibit azietomidate photolabeling,
as assayed at the level of GABA(A)R subunits on analytical SDS-PAGE,
and protein microsequencing establishes that the GABA(A)R-modulating
neurosteroids do not inhibit photolabeling of GABA(A)R alpha1Met-236
or betaMet-286 but enhance labeling of alpha1Met-236. Thus modulatory
steroids do not bind at the same site as etomidate, and neither of
the amino acids identified as neurosteroid activation determinants

When 0.1 microM ivermectin was applied to the perfusion medium, the
responses to 2 microM GABA were enhanced to 273{\%} within 60 s, and
the GABA EC50 was reduced from 8.2 to 3.2 microM. Half-maximal potentiation
of GABA responses was found with 17.8 nM ivermectin. The potentiating
effect of ivermectin diminished to 146{\%} within 10 min but the GABA
EC50 did not change any further. At the same time, the maximal GABA-induced
Cl- current decreased to 64{\%}. Both the fast and slow desensitization
time constants of GABA-activated membrane currents were shortened

irreversible. Modulation of the GABA responses by ivermectin did
not interfere with the potentiation induced by diazepam and pentobarbital
or with the sensitivity to blockade by bicuculline, picrotoxin and
Zn2+. These results support the view that ivermectin binds to a novel
site on the GABAA receptor and allosterically enhances the affinity
of the GABA binding site. The more slowly occurring conformational
changes in the ivermectin-GABAA receptor complex apparently accelerate
the desensitization of the GABAA receptor, reducing the amplitude
of maximal GABA-induced currents.},

abstract = {The $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA(A)R) is a target for
general anesthetics of diverse chemical structures, which act as
positive allosteric modulators at clinical doses. Previously, in
a heterogeneous mixture of GABA(A)Rs purified from bovine brain,
[³H]azietomidate photolabeling of $\alpha$Met-236 and $\beta$Met-286 in the $\alpha$M1
and $\beta$M3 transmembrane helices identified an etomidate binding site
in the GABA(A)R transmembrane domain at the interface between the
$\beta$ and $\alpha$ subunits [Li, G. D., et.al. (2006) J. Neurosci. 26, 11599-11605].
To further define GABA(A)R etomidate binding sites, we now use [³H]TDBzl-etomidate,
an aryl diazirine with broader amino acid side chain reactivity than
azietomidate, to photolabel purified human FLAG-$\alpha$1$\beta$3 GABA(A)Rs and
more extensively identify photolabeled GABA(A)R amino acids. [³H]TDBzl-etomidate
photolabeled in an etomidate-inhibitable manner $\beta$3Val-290, in the
$\beta$3M3 transmembrane helix, as well as $\alpha$1Met-236 in $\alpha$1M1, a residue
photolabeled by [³H]azietomidate, while no photolabeling of amino
acids in the $\alpha$M2 and $\beta$M2 helices that also border the etomidate binding
site was detected. The location of these photolabeled amino acids
in GABA(A)R homology models derived from the recently determined
structures of prokaryote (GLIC) or invertebrate (GluCl) homologues
and the results of computational docking studies predict the orientation
of [³H]TDBzl-etomidate bound in that site and the other amino acids
contributing to this GABA(A)R intersubunit etomidate binding site.
Etomidate-inhibitable photolabeling of $\beta$3Met-227 in $\beta$M1 by [³H]TDBzl-etomidate
and [³H]azietomidate also provides evidence of a homologous etomidate
binding site at the $\beta$3-$\beta$3 subunit interface in the $\alpha$1$\beta$3 GABA(A)R.},

abstract = {Construction of a GABAA receptor homology model based on the acetylcholine
(ACh) receptor structure is complicated by the low sequence similarity
between GABAA and ACh M3 transmembrane segments that creates significant
uncertainty in their alignment. We determined the orientation of
the GABAA M2 and M3 transmembrane segments using disulfide cross-linking.
The M2 residues alpha1M266 (11') and alpha1T267 (12') were mutated
to cysteine in either wild type or single M3 cysteine mutant (alpha1V297C,
alpha1A300C to alpha1A305C) backgrounds. We assayed spontaneous and
induced disulfide bond formation. Reduction with DTT significantly
potentiated GABA-induced currents in alpha1T267C-L301C and alpha1T267C-F304C.
Copper phenanthroline-induced oxidation inhibited GABA-induced currents
in these mutants and in alpha1T267C-A305C. Intrasubunit disulfide
bonds formed between these Cys pairs, implying that the alpha-carbon
separation was at most 5.6 A. The reactive alpha1M3 residues (L301,
F304, A305) lie on the same face of an alpha-helix. The unresponsive
ones (A300, I302, E303) lie on the opposite face. In the resting
state, the reactive side of alpha1M3 faces M2-alpha1T267. In conjunction
with the ACh structure, our data indicate that alignment of GABAA
and ACh M3 requires a single gap in the GABAA M2-M3 loop. In the
presence of GABA, oxidation of alpha1T267C-L301C and alpha1T267C-F304C
had no effect, but oxidation of alpha1T267C-A305C caused a significant
increase in spontaneous channel opening. We infer that, as the channel
opens, the distance and/or orientation between M2-alpha1T267 and
M3-alpha1A305 changes such that the disulfide bond stabilizes the
open state. This begins to define the conformational motion that
M2 undergoes during channel opening.},

used to treat river blindness, binds in the transmembrane domain
of the receptor and stabilizes an open-pore conformation. Glutamate
binds in the classical agonist site at subunit interfaces, and picrotoxin
directly occludes the pore near its cytosolic base. GluCl provides

pure synthetic lipids in order to study the influence of the lipid
environment on affinity state transitions and the ion translocation

of cholesteryl hemisuccinate was necessary in liposomes made of cholesteryl
hemisuccinate and dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine to mimic the kinetics
of agonist-induced state transitions observed in native membranes.
With increasing chain length of the saturated lecithins, a marked
increase in carbamylcholine dissociation constants was observed.
Substitution by other dimyristoyl phospholipids for dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine
had the same, though quantitatively less pronounced effects. Introduction
of unsaturation in the acyl chains reverted the effect of increasing
chain length. Unsaturated phosphatidylethanolamines in combination
with 28-35 mol{\%} of cholesteryl hemisuccinate was the best lipid
mixture for reconstitution of the receptor-gating function. When
phosphatidylethanolamine was replaced totally or partially by other
phospholipids with the same or different acyl chain composition,
a marked decrease of ion transport was apparent, even when similar
vesicle size, receptor incorporation, and agonist-induced affinity
transitions were obtained. Therefore, the maintenance of the affinity
state transitions of the reconstituted receptor is a necessary but
not sufficient condition for the manifestation of the ion-gating
receptor activity. On the other hand, the more unsaturated the acyl
chains of phosphatidylethanolamine are, the higher the response that
was observed, suggesting that a critical lipid packing is essential
for the ion translocation function of the receptor.},

abstract = {Cys-loop receptor neurotransmitter-gated ion channels are pentameric
assemblies of subunits that contain three domains: extracellular,
transmembrane, and intracellular. The extracellular domain forms
the agonist binding site. The transmembrane domain forms the ion
channel. The cytoplasmic domain is involved in trafficking, localization,
and modulation by cytoplasmic second messenger systems but its role
in channel assembly and function is poorly understood and little
is known about its structure. The intracellular domain is formed
by the large ({\textgreater}100 residues) loop between the alpha-helical M3 and
M4 transmembrane segments. Putative prokaryotic Cys-loop homologues
lack a large M3M4 loop. We replaced the complete M3M4 loop (115 amino
acids) in the 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3A (5-HT(3A)) subunit with
a heptapeptide from the prokaryotic homologue from Gloeobacter violaceus.
The macroscopic electrophysiological and pharmacological characteristics
of the homomeric 5-HT(3A)-glvM3M4 receptors were comparable to 5-HT(3A)
wild type. The channels remained cation-selective but the 5-HT(3A)-glvM3M4
single channel conductance was 43.5 pS as compared with the subpicosiemens
wild-type conductance. Coexpression of hRIC-3, a protein that modulates
expression of 5-HT(3) and acetylcholine receptors, significantly
attenuated 5-HT-induced currents with wild-type 5-HT(3A) but not
5-HT(3A)-glvM3M4 receptors. A similar deletion of the M3M4 loop in
the anion-selective GABA-rho1 receptor yielded functional, GABA-activated,
anion-selective channels. These results imply that the M3M4 loop
is not essential for receptor assembly and function and suggest that
the cytoplasmic domain may fold as an independent module from the

abstract = {Twenty-five avermectin analogs were assessed in a mouse seizure model.
The ED(50) against pentylenetetrazole-induced tonic seizures ranged
from 0.48 mg/kg (L-676,893) to {\textgreater}160 mg/kg (L-685,869) cf. 0. 26 mg/kg
for diazepam. Although avermectins are without acute toxic effects,
they have been historically shown to have relative low LD(50) values
in mammals. The mechanisms involved in the anticonvulsant effect
and the toxicity were investigated. A series of avermectin analogs
displaced [(3)H]ivermectin binding to rat brain membranes and recombinant
GABA(A) receptors (alpha1beta3gamma2-subtype) with the same affinities,
strongly suggesting that [(3)H]ivermectin labels the GABA(A) receptor
in rodent brain. Avermectins, which were anticonvulsant, were also
potent inhibitors of [(3)H]ivermectin binding in rat brain. However,
the rank order for anticonvulsant activity did not parallel the rank
order for affinity at the [(3)H]ivermectin site and it was reasoned
that avermectins may have differential affinity or efficacy at subtypes
of the GABA(A) receptor. All the active compounds tested potentiated
the effects of GABA at recombinant GABA(A) receptors in oocytes and
at native cortical GABA(A) receptors and the efficacy of avermectins
at the GABA(A) receptor correlated best with their anticonvulsant
potency. Although avermectins weakly inhibited [(3)H]strychnine binding
in rat spinal cord, and inhibited glycine responses on primary cultured
cortical neurons, activity at glycine receptors did not correlate
with either anticonvulsant activity or toxicity. Because both anticonvulsant
activity and toxicity correlated best with activity at GABA(A) receptors,
it is unlikely that these effects can be separated, which may contraindicate
the potential use of avermectins as anticonvulsants.},

abstract = {A photoactivatable steroid, p-azidophenacyl 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 beta-cholan-24-
ate (APL), has been synthesized and used instead of cholesterol to
functionally reconstitute purified acetylcholine receptor (AcChR)
into vesicles made of asolectin phospholipids. Upon irradiation,
the extent of AcChR photolabeling by APL is directly proportional
to the amount of APL incorporated into the reconstituted vesicles
and the maximum stoichiometry observed corresponds to approx. 50
mol of APL bound per mol of AcChR. Furthermore, all four subunits
of the AcChR become labeled by APL and the observed labeling pattern
resembles the 2:1:1:1 stoichiometry characteristic of these subunits
within the AcChR complex. The presence of either cholesterol or neutral
lipids from asolectin in the reconstituted bilayer decreases both,
the incorporation of APl into the vesicles and the covalent labeling
of the AcChR upon irradiation, without altering the stoichiometry
of labeling in AcChR subunits stated above. This suggests that the
potential interaction sites for the photoactivatable probe in the
reconstituted AcChR are mostly those normally occupied by the natural
neutral lipids. Carbamylcholine, a cholinergic agonist, also reduces
the extent of APL photolabeling of the AcChR in a dose-dependent
manner but, in contrast to the effects of cholesterol, the presence
of carbamylcholine alters the stoichiometry of labeling in the AcChR
subunits. This, along with the observation that such a decrease in
the extent of APL photolabeling caused by carbamylcholine can be
blocked by preincubation with alpha-bungarotoxin, suggest that AcChR
desensitization induced by prolonged exposure to cholinergic agonists
encompasses a rearrangement of transmembrane portions of the AcChR
protein, which can be sensed by the photoactivatable probe. Conversely,
presence of (+)-tubocurarine, a competitive cholinergic antagonist,
has no effects on altering either the extent of APL photolabeling
of the AcChR or the distribution of the labeling among AcChR subunits.},

computational predictions, there is limited experimental data available
on the structure of the beta2 subunit. Using high-resolution NMR

a four-helix bundle in the absence of the extracellular and intracellular
domains. The structure exhibited many similarities to those previously
determined for the Torpedo nAChR and the bacterial ion channel GLIC.
We also assessed the influence of the fourth transmembrane helix
(TM4) on the rest of the domain. Although secondary structures and
tertiary arrangements were similar, the addition of TM4 caused dramatic
changes in TM3 dynamics and subtle changes in TM1 and TM2. Taken
together, this study suggests that the structures of the transmembrane
domains of these proteins are largely shaped by determinants inherent
in their sequence, but their dynamics may be sensitive to modulation
by tertiary and quaternary contacts.},

determination effort that spanned several decades [Unwin N (2005)
Refined structure of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor at 4 A
resolution. J Mol Biol 346:967-989]. Purified nAChR must be reconstituted
in a mixture containing cholesterol to function. Proposed modes of
interaction between cholesterol and the protein range from specific
binding to indirect membrane-mediated mechanisms. However, the underlying
cause of nAChR sensitivity to cholesterol remains controversial,
in part because the vast majority of functional studies were conducted
before a medium resolution structure was reported. We show that the
nAChR contains internal sites capable of containing cholesterol,
whose occupation stabilizes the protein structure. We detect sites
at the protein-lipid interface as conventionally predicted from functional
data, as well as deeply buried sites that are not usually considered.
Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that occupation of both superficial
and deeply buried sites most effectively preserves the experimental
structure; the structure collapses in the absence of bound cholesterol.
In particular, we find that bound cholesterol directly supports contacts
between the agonist-binding domain and the pore that are thought
to be essential for activation of the receptor. These results likely
apply to those other ion channels within the Cys-loop superfamily
that depend on cholesterol, such as the GABA receptor.},

abstract = {Cholesterol modulates the plasmalemma's biophysical properties and
influences the function and trafficking of membrane proteins. A fundamental
phenomenon that remains obscure is how the plasmalemma's lipid composition
regulates the activatable pool of membrane receptors. An outstanding
model to study this phenomenon is the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
(nAChR), since the nAChR activatable pool has been estimated to be
but a small fraction of the receptors present in the plasmalemma.
Studies on the effect of cholesterol depletion in the function of
the Torpedo californica nAChR, using the lipid-exposed nAChR mutation
(alphaC418W) that produces a congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS),
demonstrated that cholesterol depletion causes a remarkable increase
in the alphaC418W nAChR's macroscopic current whereas not in the
wild-type (WT). A variety of approaches were used to define the mechanism
responsible for the cholesterol depletion mediated-increase in the
alphaC418W nAChR's macroscopic current. The present study suggests
that a substantial fraction of the alphaC418W nAChRs is located in
caveolin-1-positive domains, "trapped" in a non-activatable state,
and that membrane cholesterol depletion results in the relocation
of these receptors to the activatable pool. Co-fractionation and
co-immunoprecipitation of the alphaC418W nAChR and the membrane raft
protein caveolin-1 (cav1) support the notion that interactions at
lipid-exposed domains regulate the partition of the receptor into
membrane raft microdomains. These results have potential implications
as a novel mechanism to fine-tune cholinergic transmission in the

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ivermectin is a gold standard anthelmintic drug that works
by potently depressing neuronal activity and muscular contractility
in arthropods and nematodes. At the molecular level, ivermectin activates
inhibitory glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluClRs), which are
found exclusively in invertebrates, at nanomolar concentrations.
These receptors belong to the pentameric Cys-loop receptor family
of ligand-gated ion channels. Higher (micromolar) concentrations
of ivermectin also activate and/or modulate vertebrate Cys-loop receptors,
including the excitatory nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and the
inhibitory GABA type-A and glycine receptors (GlyRs). In the last
twelve months, an X-ray crystal structure of ivermectin complexed
with the C. elegans a GluClR demonstrated that ivermectin binds to
the transmembrane region of the receptor in a cleft formed at the
interface of adjacent subunits. This study also identified three
critical hydrogen bonds that were thought to attach ivermectin to
its site. Site-directed mutagenesis and voltage-clamp electrophysiology
have also been employed to probe the binding sites for ivermectin
in the a1 GlyR. This study has raised doubts as to whether the hydrogen
bonds are important for high ivermectin potency in either GlyRs or
GluClRs. Due to its lipophilic nature, it is likely that ivermectin
accumulates in the membrane and binds reversibly (i.e., weakly) to
its target site. Several lines of evidence suggest that ivermectin
opens the channel pore via a structural change that is distinct from
that induced by the endogenous neurotransmitter agonist. Finally,
voltage-clamp fluorometry has demonstrated that ivermectin induces
a global conformational change that propagates to the neurotransmitter
binding site, thus suggesting a mechanism by which ivermectin may
potentiate neurotransmitter-gated currents. Together, this information
provides new insights into the mechanisms of action of this clinically
important drug.},

abstract = {New lines of evidence suggest that volatile anesthetics interact specifically
with proteins. Direct binding analysis, however, has been largely
limited to soluble proteins. In this study, specific interaction
was investigated between isoflurane, a clinically important volatile
anesthetic, and membrane-bound nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
(nAChRs) from Torpedo electroplax, using (19)F nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy and gas chromatography. The receptors were reconstituted
into 1, 2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) lipid vesicles.
After correcting for nonspecific partitioning into the lipid, the
equilibrium dissociation constant, K(d), of isoflurane binding to
nAChR at 15 degrees C was found to be 0.36 +/- 0.03 mM. This value
is within the clinically relevant concentration range of the agent.
Based on the receptor concentrations in the vesicle suspension assayed
by the bicinchoninic acid method and the fraction of bound isoflurane,
X(b), determined by gas chromatography, an estimate of an average
of 9-10 specifically bound isoflurane molecules can be made for each
receptor, or two for each subunit. Upon binding, the transverse relaxation
time constant (T(2)) of (19)F resonance of isoflurane is decreased
by nearly three orders of magnitude, indicating a dramatic reduction
in the mobility of specifically bound isoflurane. Kinetic analysis
reveals that the off rate of binding, k(-1), is 1.7 x 10(4) s(-1).
The on rate, k(+1), can thus be calculated to be approximately 4.8
x 10(7) M(-1) s(-1), suggesting a nearly diffusion-limited association.
This is in contrast to anesthetic binding to a soluble protein, bovine
serum albumin (BSA), where k(+1) and k(-1) are at least an order
of magnitude slower. It is concluded that the presence of lipids
may be critical for the correct evaluation of binding kinetics between
volatile anesthetics and neuronal receptors.},

For example, it is found that the double-annihilation method of computing

but can be modified to yield this quantity. The derivation also makes
it possible to define clearly the changes in translational, rotational,
configurational, and solvent entropy upon binding. It is argued that
molecular mass has a negligible effect upon the standard free energy

the knowledge of anesthetic binding to these proteins remains limited.
Here we investigate anesthetic binding to the bacterial Gloeobacter
violaceus pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC), a structural
homolog of cys-loop receptors, using an experimental and computational
hybrid approach. Tryptophan fluorescence quenching experiments showed
halothane and thiopental binding at three tryptophan-associated sites
in the extracellular (EC) domain, transmembrane (TM) domain, and
EC-TM interface of GLIC. An additional binding site at the EC-TM
interface was predicted by docking analysis and validated by quenching
experiments on the N200W GLIC mutant. The binding affinities (K(D))
of 2.3 ± 0.1 mM and 0.10 ± 0.01 mM were derived from the fluorescence
quenching data of halothane and thiopental, respectively. Docking
these anesthetics to the original GLIC crystal structure and the
structures relaxed by molecular dynamics simulations revealed intrasubunit
sites for most halothane binding and intersubunit sites for thiopental
binding. Tryptophans were within reach of both intra- and intersubunit
binding sites. Multiple molecular dynamics simulations on GLIC in
the presence of halothane at different sites suggested that anesthetic
binding at the EC-TM interface disrupted the critical interactions
for channel gating, altered motion of the TM23 linker, and destabilized
the open-channel conformation that can lead to inhibition of GLIC
channel current. The study has not only provided insights into anesthetic
binding in GLIC, but also demonstrated a successful fusion of experiments
and computations for understanding anesthetic actions in complex
proteins.},

abstract = {We studied the effects of the volatile anesthetic isoflurane on nicotinic
acetylcholine (ACh) receptor channels using a technique for rapid
perfusion of ACh to outside-out patches. Channels were activated
by ACh, at concentrations ranging from 1 microM to 10 mM, and the
macroscopic current flowing through tens or hundreds of channels
was measured. Isoflurane reduced the peak current response to saturating
concentrations of ACh, increased the current decay rate due to desensitization,
and decreased the rate of recovery from desensitization. The effect
of isoflurane on peak currents was concentration dependent; at 2{\%}
isoflurane, the peak current was reduced by half. The effect of isoflurane
on the peak current induced by nonsaturating concentrations of ACh
was smaller. We measured the onset and recovery of current inhibition
by isoflurane, by rapidly applying and removing isoflurane to the
patch within 100 microseconds. 2{\%} isoflurane, currents were inhibited
with a time constant of 200-300 microseconds and recovered with a
time constant of 500-700 microseconds. We interpreted our results
in terms of a kinetic model in which isoflurane binds directly to
both open and closed channels (not necessarily within the pore of
the channel) and stops the flow of ions through open channels. This
model provides a quantitative explanation for the kinetic and equilibrium
effects of isoflurane on peak currents activated by saturating concentrations
of ACh. Our data support the idea that the flickering effect of isoflurane
on single ACh receptor channels is caused by rapid binding and dissociation
of isoflurane to an inhibitory binding site on the protein. The effects
of isoflurane on the apparent affinity of ACh and on desensitization
are not predicted by the model. These effects may arise from the
binding of isoflurane to other sites, not necessarily on the protein
itself.},

the partitioning of the volatile anesthetic halothane from an aqueous

(DOPC) lipids, with embedded alpha-helical peptide bundles based
on the membrane-bound portions of the alpha- and delta-subunits,
respectively, of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. In the molecular
dynamics simulations halothane molecules spontaneously partitioned
into the DOPC bilayer and then preferentially occupied regions close
to lipid headgroups. A single halothane molecule was observed to
bind to tyrosine (Tyr-277) residue in the alpha-subunit, an experimentally
identified specific binding site. The binding of halothane attenuated
the local loop dynamics of alpha-subunit and significantly influenced
global concerted motions suggesting anesthetic action in modulating
protein function. Steered molecular dynamics calculations on a single
halothane molecule partitioned into a DOPC lipid bilayer were performed
to probe the free energy profile of halothane across the lipid-water
interface and rationalize the observed spontaneous partitioning.
Partitioned halothane molecules affect the hydrocarbon chains of
the DOPC lipid, by lowering of the hydrocarbon tilt angles. The anesthetic
molecules also caused a decrease in the number of peptide-lipid contacts.
The observed local and global effects of anesthetic binding on protein
motions demonstrated in this study may underlie the mechanism of
action of anesthetics at a molecular level.},

We found all six mutants to be in the same 'locally closed' conformation

targets of anesthetic molecules, and that ion channels interact differently
with anesthetics in their open and closed conformations. The availability
of an open and a closed structural model for the KirBac1.1 potassium
channel has made it possible to perform a comparative analysis of
the interactions of anesthetics with the same channel in its open

Normal mode analysis on the closed and open channel, in the presence

global as well as the local dynamics of both conformations differently.
In the case of the open channel, the observed reduction of flexibility
of residues in the inner helices suggests a functional modification
action of anesthetics on ion channels. In this context, preferential
quenching of the aromatic residue motion and modulation of global

@article{Mitchell2008,
abstract = {Over the past 20 years it has become apparent that certain steroids,
synthesised de novo in the brain, hence named neurosteroids, produce
immediate changes (within seconds) in neuronal excitability, a time
scale that precludes a genomic locus of action. Identified molecular
targets underlying modulation of brain excitability include both
the inhibitory GABA(A) and the excitatory NMDA receptor. Of particular
interest is the interaction of certain neurosteroids with the GABA(A)
receptor, the major inhibitory receptor in mammalian brain. During
the last decade, compelling evidence has accrued to reveal that locally
produced neurosteroids may selectively "fine tune" neuronal inhibition.
A range of molecular mechanisms including the subunit composition
of the receptor(s), phosphorylation and local steroid metabolism,
underpin the region- and neuronal selectivity of action of neurosteroids
at synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors. The relative contribution
played by each of these mechanisms in a variety of physiological
and pathophysiological scenarios is currently being scrutinised at
a cellular and molecular level. However, it is not known how such
mechanisms may act in concert to influence behavioural profiles in
health and disease. An important question concerns the identification
of the anatomical substrates mediating the repertoire of behaviours
produced by neurosteroids. "Knock-in" mice expressing mutant GABA(A)
subunits engineered to be insensitive to benzodiazepines or general
anaesthetics have proved invaluable in evaluating the role of GABA(A)
receptor subtypes in complex behaviours such as sedation, cognition
and anxiety [Rudolph, U., Mohler, H., 2006. GABA-based therapeutic
approaches: GABA(A) receptor subtype functions. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol.
6, 18-23]. However, the development of a similar approach for neurosteroids
has been hampered by the limited knowledge that, until recently,
has surrounded the identity of the amino acid residues contributing
to the neurosteroid binding pocket. Here, we will review recent progress
in identifying the neurosteroid binding site on the GABA(A) receptor,
and discuss how these discoveries will impact on our understanding
of the role of neurosteroids in health and disease.},

abstract = {Disturbances in critical cognitive processes, such as working memory,
are now regarded as core features of schizophrenia, but available
pharmacological treatments produce little or no improvement in these
cognitive deficits. Although other explanations are possible, these
cognitive deficits appear to reflect a disturbance in executive control,
the processes that facilitate complex information processing and
behavior and that include context representation and maintenance,
functions dependent on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).
Studies in non-human primates indicate that normal working memory
function depends upon appropriate GABA neurotransmission in the DLPFC,
and alterations in markers of GABA neurotransmission are well documented
in the DLPFC of subjects with schizophrenia.Thus, the purpose of
this paper is to review the nature of the altered GABA neurotransmission
in the DLPFC in schizophrenia, and to consider how these findings
might inform the search for new treatments for cognitive dysfunction
in this illness.Postmortem studies suggest that markers of reduced
GABA neurotransmission in schizophrenia may be selective for, or
at least particularly prominent in, the subclass of GABA neurons,
chandelier cells, that provide inhibitory input to the axon initial
segment of populations of pyramidal neurons. Given the critical role
that chandelier cells play in synchronizing the activity of pyramidal
neurons, the pharmacological amelioration of this deficit may be
particularly effective in normalizing the neural network activity
required for working memory function. Because GABA(A) receptors containing
the a(2) subunit are selectively localized to the axon initial segment
of pyramidal cells, and appear to be markedly up-regulated in schizophrenia,
treatment with novel benzodiazepine-like agents with selective activity
at GABA(A) receptors containing the a(2) subunit may be effective
adjuvant agents for improving working memory function in schizophrenia.},

channel study (J. Phys. Chem. B 2009, 113, 12581) were performed
on the closed-channel alpha4beta2 nAChR to investigate the conformation-dependent
anesthetic effects on channel structures and dynamics. Flexible ligand
docking and over 20 ns molecular dynamics simulations revealed similar
halothane-binding sites in the closed and open channels. The sites
with relatively high binding affinities (approximately -6.0 kcal/mol)
were identified at the interface of extracellular (EC) and transmembrane
(TM) domains or at the interface between alpha4 and beta2 subunits.
Despite similar sites for halothane binding, the closed-channel conformation
showed much less sensitivity than the open channel to the structural
and dynamical perturbations from halothane. Compared to the systems
without anesthetics, the amount of water inside the pore decreased
by 22{\%} in the presence of halothane in the open channel but only
by 6{\%} in the closed channel. Comparison of the nonbonded interactions
at the EC/TM interfaces suggested that the beta2 subunits were more
prone than the alpha4 subunits to halothane binding. In addition,
our data support the notion that halothane exerts its effect by disturbing
the quaternary structure and dynamics of the channel. The study concludes
that sensitivity and global dynamics responsiveness of alpha4beta2

receptors ("chaperone-like" effect), these lipids can regulate neurotransmitter
binding, signal transducing functions, and, in the case of multimeric
receptors, subunit assembly and subsequent receptor trafficking to
the cell surface. Several sphingolipids (especially gangliosides)
also exhibit low/moderate affinity for neurotransmitters. We suggest
that such lipids could facilitate (i) the attachment of neurotransmitters
to the post-synaptic membrane and in some cases (ii) their subsequent
delivery to specific protein receptors. Overall, various experimental
approaches provide converging evidence that the biological functions
of neurotransmitters and their receptors are highly dependent upon
sphingolipids and cholesterol, which are active partners of synaptic
transmission. Several decades of research have been necessary to
untangle the skein of a complex network of molecular interactions
between neurotransmitters, their receptors, cholesterol and sphingolipids.
This sophisticated crosstalk between all four distinctive partners
may allow a fine biochemical tuning of synaptic transmission.},

GABA(A) receptor by the neurotransmitter GABA plays a crucial role
in controlling neuronal excitability. This essential form of neuronal
regulation may be subject to "fine tuning" by particular metabolites
of progesterone and deoxycorticosterone, which bind directly to the
GABA(A) receptor to enhance the actions of GABA. Originally such
steroids were considered to act as endocrine messengers, being synthesised
in peripheral glands such as the adrenals and ovaries and crossing
the blood brain barrier to influence neuronal signalling. However,
it is now evident that certain neurons and glia may produce such
"neurosteroids" and that these locally synthesised modulators may
act in a paracrine, or indeed an autocrine manner to influence neuronal
activity. Neurosteroid synthesis may change dynamically in a variety
of physiological situations (e.g. stress, pregnancy) and perturbations
in their levels are implicated in a variety of neurological and psychiatric
disorders. Here we will consider (1) evidence supporting the concept
that neurosteroids act as local regulators of neuronal inhibition,
(2) that extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors appear to be a particularly
important neurosteroid target and (3) recent advances in defining
the neurosteroid binding site(s) on the GABA(A) receptor.},

abstract = {The gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor represents an
elementary switching mechanism integral to the functioning of the
central nervous system and a locus for the action of many mood- and
emotion-altering agents such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, steroids,
and alcohol. Anxiety, sleep disorders, and convulsive disorders have
been effectively treated with therapeutic agents that enhance the
action of GABA at the GABAA receptor or increase the concentration
of GABA in nervous tissue. The GABAA receptor is a multimeric membrane-spanning
ligand-gated ion channel that admits chloride upon binding of the
neurotransmitter GABA and is modulated by many endogenous and therapeutically
important agents. Since GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter
in the CNS, modulation of its response has profound implications
for brain functioning. The GABAA receptor is virtually the only site
of action for the centrally acting benzodiazepines, the most widely
prescribed of the anti-anxiety medications. Increasing evidence points
to an important role for GABA in epilepsy and various neuropsychiatric
disorders. Recent advances in molecular biology and complementary
information derived from pharmacology, biochemistry, electrophysiology,
anatomy and cell biology, and behavior have led to a phenomenal growth
in our understanding of the structure, function, regulation, and
evolution of the GABAA receptor. Benzodiazepines, barbiturates, steroids,
polyvalent cations, and ethanol act as positive or negative modulators
of receptor function. The description of a receptor gene superfamily
comprising the subunits of the GABAA, nicotinic acetylcholine, and
glycine receptors has led to a new way of thinking about gene expression
and receptor assembly in the nervous system. Seventeen genetically
distinct subunit subtypes (alpha 1-alpha 6, beta 1-beta 4, gamma
1-gamma 4, delta, p1-p2) and alternatively spliced variants contribute
to the molecular architecture of the GABAA receptor. Mysteriously,
certain preferred combinations of subunits, most notably the alpha
1 beta 2 gamma 2 arrangement, are widely codistributed, while the
expression of other subunits, such as beta 1 or alpha 6, is severely
restricted to specific neurons in the hippocampal formation or cerebellar
cortex. Nervous tissue has the capacity to exert control over receptor
number, allosteric uncoupling, subunit mRNA levels, and posttranslational
modifications through cellular signal transduction mechanisms under
active investigation. The genomic organization of the GABAA receptor
genes suggests that the present abundance of subtypes arose during
evolution through the duplication and translocations of a primordial
alpha-beta-gamma gene cluster. This review describes these varied
aspects of GABAA receptor research with special emphasis on contemporary
cellular and molecular discoveries.},

californica nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) that interact
with cholesterol. [3H]Azicholesterol partitioned into nAChR-enriched
membranes very efficiently ({\textgreater}98{\%}), photoincorporated into nAChR
subunits on an equal molar basis, and neither the pattern nor the
extent of labeling was affected by the presence of the agonist carbamylcholine,
consistent with photoincorporation at the nAChR lipid-protein interface.
Sites of [3H]Azicholesterol incorporation in each nAChR subunit were
initially mapped by Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease digestion to
two relatively large homologous fragments that contain either the
transmembrane segments M1-M2-M3 (e.g., alphaV8-20) or M4 (e.g., alphaV8-10).
The distribution of [3H]Azicholesterol labeling between these two
fragments (e.g., alphaV8-20, 29{\%}; alphaV8-10, 71{\%}), suggests that
the M4 segment has the greatest interaction with membrane cholesterol.
Photolabeled amino acid residues in each M4 segment were identified
by Edman degradation of isolated tryptic fragments and generally
correspond to acidic residues located at either end of each transmembrane
helix (e.g., alphaAsp-407). [3H]Azicholesterol labeling was also
mapped to peptides that contain either the M3 or M1 segment of each
nAChR subunit. These results establish that cholesterol likely interacts
with the M4, M3, and M1 segments of each subunit, and therefore,
the cholesterol binding domain fully overlaps the lipid-protein interface
of the nAChR.},

abstract = {When nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are reconstituted into lipid
bilayers lacking cholesterol, agonists no longer stimulate cation
flux. The kinetics of this process are difficult to study because
variations in vesicle morphology cause errors in flux measurements.
We developed a new stopped-flow fluorescence assay to study activation
independently of vesicle morphology. When receptors were rapidly
mixed with agonist plus ethidium, the earliest fluorescence increase
reported the fraction of channels that opened and their apparent
rate of fast desensitization. These processes were absent when the
receptor was reconstituted into dioleoylphosphatidylcholine or into
a mixture of that lipid with dioleoylphosphatidic acid (12 mol{\%}),
even though a fluorescent agonist reported that resting-state receptors
were still present. The agonist-induced channel opening probability
increased with bilayer cholesterol, with a midpoint value of 9 +/-
1.7 mol{\%} and a Hill coefficient of 1.9 +/- 0.69, reaching a plateau
above 20-30 mol{\%} cholesterol that was equal to the native value.
On the other hand, the observed fast desensitization rate was comparable
to that for native membranes from the lowest cholesterol concentration
examined (5 mol{\%}). Thus the ability to reach the open state after
activation varies with the cholesterol concentration in the bilayer,
whereas the rate of the open state to fast desensitized state transition
is unaffected. The structural basis for this is unknown, but an interesting
corollary is that the channels of newly synthesized receptors are
not fully primed by cholesterol until they are inserted into the
plasma membrane--a novel form of posttranslational processing.},

from Torpedo californica have been measured in reconstituted membranes
containing purified receptor and defined lipids. The ability of brominated
lipids to partially quench the intrinsic fluorescence of the acetylcholine
receptor has been exploited to monitor contacts between the protein
and the surrounding lipid. Relative binding constants for lipid binding
to the protein have been quantitatively determined by measuring quenching
observed in mixtures of brominated and nonbrominated lipids by use
of equilibrium exchange equations developed by London and Feigenson
[London, E., {\&} Feigenson, G. W. (1981) Biochemistry 20, 1939-1948]

G. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 1432-1441]. Dioleoylphosphatidylcholine
and its dibromo derivative are the two principal lipids used in the
reconstituted membranes to establish the quenching parameters. Competition
studies between cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine indicate that
cholesterol does not compete effectively for the phospholipid sites
presumed to surround the membrane-embedded portions of the receptor
(annular lipids). However, dibromocholesterol partially quenches
the receptor and leads to additional quenching of receptor in pure
dibromophosphatidylcholine membranes. The results are consistent
with the presence of additional binding sites for cholesterol that
are not accessible to phospholipids (nonannular sites). Similar results
are obtained by using cholesterol hemisuccinate and its dibromo analogue,
both of which can be introduced into membranes more easily than cholesterol
because of their greater solubility in water. Fatty acids appear
to compete for both annular and nonannular sites, and analysis of
the quenching data suggests that there are 5-10 nonannular sites
associated with the receptor. Cholesterol has been shown to play
a critical role in both acetylcholine receptor structural stabilization
and ion channel activity, and the results presented here provide
additional information about cholesterol-receptor interactions.},

Molecular dynamics simulations predicted critical GABA binding interactions with aromatic residues F206, Y254, and Y109 and hydrophilic residues E204, S176, R111, R166, S176, and T251. These residues were mutated, expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and their functions assessed using electrophysiology. The data support the binding mechanism provided by the simulations, which predict that GABA forms many interactions with binding site residues, the most significant of which are cation-$\pi$ interactions with F206 and Y254, H-bonds with E204, S205, R111, S176, T251, and ionic interactions with R111 and E204. These findings clarify the roles of a range of residues in binding GABA in the RDL receptor, and also show that molecular dynamics simulations are a useful tool to identify specific interactions in Cys-loop receptors.},

Its mutation to residues other than aspartic acid dramatically inhibits activity, and proton translocation is lost. However, this glutamic acid is replaced by a nonacidic residue in some structurally distant members of the heme-copper oxidases, which have a tyrosine residue in the vicinity. Here, using cytochrome c oxidase from Paracoccus denitrificans, we show that replacement of the glutamic acid and a conserved glycine nearby lowers the catalytic activity to {\textless}0.1{\%} of the wild-type value. But if, in addition, a phenylalanine that lies close in the structure is changed to tyrosine, the activity rises more than 100-fold and proton translocation is restored. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the tyrosine can support a transient array of water molecules that may be essential for proton transfer in the heme-copper oxidases. Surprisingly, the glutamic acid is thus not indispensable, which puts important constraints on the catalytic mechanism of these enzymes.},

MD simulations of the muscle nicotinic receptor, imbedded in a lipid bilayer with an applied transmembrane potential, reveal single cation translocation events during transient periods of channel hydration. During the simulation trajectory, cations paused for prolonged periods near several rings of anionic residues projecting from the lumen of the extracellular domain of the receptor, but subsequently the cation moved rapidly through the hydrophobic transmembrane region as the constituent alpha-helices exhibited back and forth rocking motions. Cocrystallization of acetylcholine binding protein with sulfate ions revealed coordination of five sulfates with residues from one of these charged rings; in cation-selective Cys-loop receptors this ring contains negatively charged residues, whereas in anion-selective receptors it contains positively charged residues. In the muscle nicotinic receptor, charge reversal of residues of this ring decreases unitary conductance by up to 80{\%}. Thus in Cys-loop receptors, a series of charged rings along the ion translocation pathway concentrates hydrated ions relative to bulk solution, giving rise to charge selectivity, and then subtle motions of the hydrophobic transmembrane, coupled with transient periods of water filling, enable rapid ion flux.},

abstract = {We have developed a homology model of the GABA(A) receptor, using the subunit combination of alpha1beta2gamma2, the most prevalent type in the mammalian brain. The model is produced in two parts: the membrane-embedded channel domain and the extracellular N-terminal domain. The pentameric transmembrane domain model is built by modeling each subunit by homology with the equivalent subunit of the heteropentameric acetylcholine receptor transmembrane domain. This segment is then joined with the extracellular domain built by homology with the acetylcholine binding protein. The all-atom model forms a wide extracellular vestibule that is connected to an oval chamber near the external surface of the membrane. A narrow, cylindrical transmembrane channel links the outer segment of the pore to a shallow intracellular vestibule. The physiological properties of the model so constructed are examined using electrostatic calculations and Brownian dynamics simulations. A deep energy well of approximately 80 kT accommodates three Cl(-) ions in the narrow transmembrane channel and seven Cl(-) ions in the external vestibule. Inward permeation takes place when one of the ions queued in the external vestibule enters the narrow segment and ejects the innermost ion. The model, when incorporated into Brownian dynamics, reproduces key experimental features, such as the single-channel current-voltage-concentration profiles. Finally, we simulate the gamma2 K289M epilepsy inducing mutation and examine Cl(-) ion permeation through the mutant receptor.},

abstract = {Cys-loop receptors are molecular targets of general anesthetics, but the knowledge of anesthetic binding to these proteins remains limited. Here we investigate anesthetic binding to the bacterial Gloeobacter violaceus pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC), a structural homolog of cys-loop receptors, using an experimental and computational hybrid approach. Tryptophan fluorescence quenching experiments showed halothane and thiopental binding at three tryptophan-associated sites in the extracellular (EC) domain, transmembrane (TM) domain, and EC-TM interface of GLIC. An additional binding site at the EC-TM interface was predicted by docking analysis and validated by quenching experiments on the N200W GLIC mutant. The binding affinities (K(D)) of 2.3 ± 0.1 mM and 0.10 ± 0.01 mM were derived from the fluorescence quenching data of halothane and thiopental, respectively. Docking these anesthetics to the original GLIC crystal structure and the structures relaxed by molecular dynamics simulations revealed intrasubunit sites for most halothane binding and intersubunit sites for thiopental binding. Tryptophans were within reach of both intra- and intersubunit binding sites. Multiple molecular dynamics simulations on GLIC in the presence of halothane at different sites suggested that anesthetic binding at the EC-TM interface disrupted the critical interactions for channel gating, altered motion of the TM23 linker, and destabilized the open-channel conformation that can lead to inhibition of GLIC channel current. The study has not only provided insights into anesthetic binding in GLIC, but also demonstrated a successful fusion of experiments and computations for understanding anesthetic actions in complex proteins.},

abstract = {Although general anesthetics are known to modulate the activity of ligand-gated ion channels in the Cys-loop superfamily, there is at present neither consensus on the underlying mechanisms, nor predictive models of this modulation. Viable models need to offer quantitative assessment of the relative importance of several identified anesthetic binding sites. However, to date, precise affinity data for individual sites has been challenging to obtain by biophysical means. Here, the likely role of pore block inhibition by the general anesthetics isoflurane and propofol of the prokaryotic pentameric channel GLIC is investigated by molecular simulations. Microscopic affinities are calculated for both single and double occupancy binding of isoflurane and propofol to the GLIC pore. Computations are carried out for an open-pore conformation in which the pore is restrained to crystallographic radius, and a closed-pore conformation that results from unrestrained molecular dynamics equilibration of the structure. The GLIC pore is predicted to be blocked at the micromolar concentrations for which inhibition by isofluorane and propofol is observed experimentally. Calculated affinities suggest that pore block by propofol occurs at signifcantly lower concentrations than those for which inhibition is observed: we argue that this discrepancy may result from binding of propofol to an allosteric site recently identified by X-ray crystallography, which may cause a competing gain-of-function effect. Affinities of isoflurane and propofol to the allosteric site are also calculated, and shown to be 3 mM for isoflurane and 10 $\mu$M for propofol; both anesthetics have a lower affinity for the allosteric site than for the unoccupied pore.},

abstract = {The ligand-gated ion channel from Erwinia chrysanthemi (ELIC) is a prokaryotic homolog of the eukaryotic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) that responds to the binding of neurotransmitter acetylcholine and mediates fast signal transmission. ELIC is similar to the nAChR in its primary sequence and overall subunit organization, but despite their structural similarity, it is not clear whether these two ligand-gated ion channels operate in a similar manner. Further, it is not known to what extent mechanistic insights gleaned from the ELIC structure translate to eukaryotic counterparts such as the nAChR. Here we use molecular-dynamics simulations to probe the conformational dynamics and hydration of the transmembrane pore of ELIC. The results are compared with those from our previous simulation of the human alpha7 nAChR. Overall, ELIC displays increased stability compared to the nAChR, whereas the two proteins exhibit remarkable similarity in their global motion and flexibility patterns. The majority of the increased stability of ELIC does not stem from the deficiency of the models used in the simulations, and but rather seems to have a structural basis. Slightly altered dynamical correlation features are also observed among several loops within the membrane region. In sharp contrast to the nAChR, ELIC is completely dehydrated from the pore center to the extracellular end throughout the simulation. Finally, the simulation of an ELIC mutant substantiates the important role of F246 on the stability, hydration and possibly function of the ELIC channel.},

abstract = {GABA acts on GABA(A) receptors to evoke both phasic inhibitory synaptic events and persistent, tonic currents. The gamma2 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor is involved in both phasic and tonic signaling in the hippocampus. Several mutations of this subunit are linked to human epileptic syndromes with febrile seizures, yet it is not clear how they perturb neuronal activity. Here, we examined the expression and functional impact of recombinant gamma2 in hippocampal neurons. We show that the K289M mutation has no effect on membrane trafficking and synaptic aggregation of recombinant gamma2, but accelerates the decay of synaptic currents. In contrast, the R43Q mutation primarily reduces surface expression of recombinant gamma2. However, it has no dominant effect on synaptic currents but instead reduces tonic GABA currents, at least in part by reducing surface expression of the alpha5 subunit. Our data suggests that the phenotypic specificity of mutations affecting the GABA(A) receptor gamma2 gene may result from different actions specific to distinct modes of GABAergic signaling.},

abstract = {Mutations that impair the expression and/or function of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors can lead to epilepsy. The familial epilepsy gamma2(K289M) mutation affects a basic residue conserved in the TM2-3 linker of most GABAA subunits. We investigated the effect on expression and function of the Lys --{\textgreater} Met mutation in mouse alpha1(K278M), beta2(K274M), and gamma2(K289M) subunits. Compared with cells expressing wild-type and alpha1beta2gamma2(K289M) receptors, cells expressing alpha1(K278M)beta2gamma2 and alpha1beta2(K274M)gamma2 receptors exhibited reduced agonist-evoked current density and reduced GABA potency, with no change in single channel conductance. The low current density of alpha1beta2(K274M)gamma2 receptors coincided with reduced surface expression. By contrast the surface expression of alpha1(K278M)beta2gamma2 receptors was similar to wild-type and alpha1beta2gamma2(K289M) receptors suggesting that the alpha1(K278M) impairs function. In keeping with this interpretation GABA-activated channels mediated by alpha1(K278M)beta2gamma2 receptors had brief open times. To a lesser extent gamma2(K289M) also reduced mean open time, whereas beta2(K274M) had no effect. We used propofol as an alternative GABAA receptor agonist to test whether the functional deficits of mutant subunits were specific to GABA activation. Propofol was less potent as an activator of alpha1(K278M)beta2gamma2 receptors. By contrast, neither beta2(K274M) nor gamma2(K289M) affected the potency of propofol. The beta2(K274M) construct was unique in that it reduced the efficacy of propofol activation relative to GABA. These data suggest that the alpha1 subunit Lys-278 residue plays a pivotal role in channel gating that is not dependent on occupancy of the GABA binding site. Moreover, the conserved TM2-3 loop lysine has an asymmetric function in different GABAA subunits.},

abstract = {The GABA(A) receptor $\gamma$2 subunit nonsense mutation Q351X has been associated with the genetic epilepsy syndrome generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus, which includes a spectrum of seizures types from febrile seizures to Dravet syndrome. Although most genetic epilepsy syndromes are mild and remit with age, Dravet syndrome has a more severe clinical course with refractory seizures associated with developmental delay and cognitive impairment. The basis for the broad spectrum of seizure phenotypes is uncertain. We demonstrated previously that the GABA(A) receptor $\gamma$2 subunit gene Q351X mutation suppressed biogenesis of wild-type partnering $\alpha$1 and $\beta$2 subunits in addition to its loss of function. Here we show that $\gamma$2S(Q351X) subunits have an additional impairment of biogenesis. Mutant $\gamma$2(Q351X) subunits were degraded more slowly than wild-type $\gamma$2 subunits and formed SDS-resistant, high-molecular-mass complexes or aggregates in multiple cell types, including neurons. The half-life of $\gamma$2S(Q351X) subunits was ∼4 h, whereas that of $\gamma$2S subunits was ∼2 h. Mutant subunits formed complexes rapidly after synthesis onset. Using multiple truncated subunits, we demonstrated that aggregate formation was a general phenomenon for truncated $\gamma$2S subunits and that their Cys-loop cysteines were involved in aggregate formation. Protein aggregation is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, but the effects of the mutant $\gamma$2S(Q351X) subunit aggregates on neuronal function and survival are unclear. Additional validation of the mutant subunit aggregation in vivo and determination of the involved signaling pathways will help reveal the pathological effects of these mutant subunit aggregates in the pathogenesis of genetic epilepsy syndromes.},

Two rapid reaction techniques, the cell-flow and the laser-pulse photolysis methods, were used in combination with whole-cell current recordings. 150-muM 5alpha-THDOC does not affect the rate constant for channel opening (k(op)) of approximately 250 s(-1) but does decrease the rate constant for channel closing (k(cl)) from 121 +/- 11 s(-1) to 56 +/- 21 s(-1). This results in an increase in the channel-opening equilibrium constant ((Phi(-1) = k(op)/k(cl)) by a factor of about 2, leading to about 50{\%} alleviation of the malfunction of the inheritable mutated (alpha1beta2gamma2L(K289M)) GABA(A) receptor linked to GEFS+.},

abstract = {Major advances in the identification of genes implicated in idiopathic epilepsy have been made. Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+), benign familial neonatal convulsions and nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, three autosomal dominant idiopathic epilepsies, result from mutations affecting voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, respectively. Disruption of GABAergic neurotransmission mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) has been implicated in epilepsy for many decades. We now report a K289M mutation in the GABA(A) receptor gamma2-subunit gene (GABRG2) that segregates in a family with a phenotype closely related to GEFS+ (ref. 8), an autosomal dominant disorder associating febrile seizures and generalized epilepsy previously linked to mutations in sodium channel genes. The K289M mutation affects a highly conserved residue located in the extracellular loop between transmembrane segments M2 and M3. Analysis of the mutated and wild-type alleles in Xenopus laevis oocytes confirmed the predicted effect of the mutation, a decrease in the amplitude of GABA-activated currents. We thus provide the first genetic evidence that a GABA(A) receptor is directly involved in human idiopathic epilepsy.},

abstract = {Although many genes that predispose for epilepsy in humans have been determined, those that underlie the classical syndromes of idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) have yet to be identified. We report that an Ala322Asp mutation in GABRA1, encoding the alpha1 subunit of the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subtype A (GABA(A)), is found in affected individuals of a large French Canadian family with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Compared with wildtype receptors, GABA(A) receptors that contain the mutant subunit show a lesser amplitude of GABA-activated currents in vitro, indicating that seizures may result from loss of function of this inhibitory ligand-gated channel. Our results confirm that mutation of GABRA1 predisposes towards a common idiopathic generalized epilepsy syndrome in humans.},

abstract = {We present a refined model of the membrane-associated Torpedo acetylcholine (ACh) receptor at 4A resolution. An improved experimental density map was obtained from 342 electron images of helical tubes, and the refined structure was derived to an R-factor of 36.7{\%} (R(free) 37.9{\%}) by standard crystallographic methods, after placing the densities corresponding to a single molecule into an artificial unit cell. The agreement between experimental and calculated phases along the helical layer-lines was used to monitor progress in the refinement and to give an independent measure of the accuracy. The atomic model allowed a detailed description of the whole receptor in the closed-channel form, including the ligand-binding and intracellular domains, which have not previously been interpreted at a chemical level. We confirm that the two ligand-binding alpha subunits have a different extended conformation from the three other subunits in the closed channel, and identify several interactions on both pairs of subunit interfaces, and within the alpha subunits, which may be responsible for their "distorted" structures. The ACh-coordinating amino acid side-chains of the alpha subunits are far apart in the closed channel, indicating that a localised rearrangement, involving closure of loops B and C around the bound ACh molecule, occurs upon activation. A comparison of the structure of the alpha subunit with that of AChBP having ligand present, suggests how the localised rearrangement overcomes the distortions and initiates the rotational movements associated with opening of the channel. Both vestibules of the channel are strongly electronegative, providing a cation-stabilising environment at either entrance of the membrane pore. Access to the pore on the intracellular side is further influenced by narrow lateral windows, which would be expected to screen out electrostatically ions of the wrong charge and size.},

The emerging insights might be expected to explain how mutations of receptors cause neurological disease, but the opposite is generally true.

abstract = {Neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) mediate rapid synaptic transmission by activating receptors belonging to the gene superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs). These channels are pentameric proteins that function as signal transducers, converting chemical messages into electrical signals. Neurotransmitters activate LGICs by interacting with a ligand-binding site, triggering a conformational change in the protein that results in the opening of an ion channel. This process, which is known as 'gating', occurs rapidly and reversibly, but the molecular rearrangements involved are not well understood. Here we show that optimal gating in the GABA(A) receptor, a member of the LGIC superfamily, is dependent on electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged Asp 57 and Asp 149 residues in extracellular loops 2 and 7, and the positively charged Lys 279 residue in the transmembrane 2-3 linker region of the alpha1-subunit. During gating, Asp 149 and Lys 279 seem to move closer to one another, providing a potential mechanism for the coupling of ligand binding to opening of the ion channel.},

By measuring electrophysiological responses in chimeric alpha7/alpha3 receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes, we have showed the involvement of the M2-M3 loop in coupling agonist binding to the channel gate. An aspartate residue therein, Asp-266 in the alpha7 subunit, was identified by site-directed mutagenesis as crucial, since mutants at this position exhibited very poor functional responses to three different nicotinic agonists. We have extended this investigation to another neuronal nicotinic receptor (alpha3/beta4), and found that a homologous residue in the beta4 subunit, Asp-268, played a similar role in coupling. These findings are consistent with a hypothesis that the aspartate residue in the M2-M3 loop, which is conserved in all homomer-forming alpha-type subunits and all neuronal beta-type subunits that combine to form functional receptors, is a major determinant of information transmission from binding site to channel gate in all neuronal nicotinic receptors.},

abstract = {The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) transduces binding of nerve-released ACh into opening of an intrinsic ion channel, yet the intraprotein interactions behind transduction remain to be fully elucidated. Attention has focused on the region of the AChR in which the beta1-beta2 and Cys-loops from the extracellular domain project into a cavity framed by residues preceding the first transmembrane domain (pre-M1) and the linker spanning transmembrane domains M2 and M3. Previous studies identified a principal transduction pathway in which the pre-M1 domain is coupled to the M2-M3 linker through the beta1-beta2 loop. Here we identify a parallel pathway in which the pre-M1 domain is coupled to the M2-M3 linker through the Cys-loop. Mutagenesis, single-channel kinetic analyses and thermodynamic mutant cycle analyses reveal energetic coupling among alphaLeu 210 from the pre-M1 domain, alphaPhe 135 and alphaPhe 137 from the Cys-loop, and alphaLeu 273 from the M2-M3 linker. Residues at equivalent positions of non-alpha-subunits show negligible coupling, indicating these interresidue couplings are specific to residues in the alpha-subunit. Thus, the extracellular beta1-beta2 and Cys-loops bridge the pre-M1 domain and M2-M3 linker to transduce agonist binding into channel gating.},

abstract = {GABA(A) receptors are the major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain and are the site of action of many clinically important drugs. These receptors are composed of five subunits that can belong to eight different subunit classes. If all GABA(A) receptor subunits could randomly combine with each other, an extremely large number of GABA(A) receptor subtypes with distinct subunit composition and arrangement would be formed. Depending on their subunit composition, these receptors would exhibit distinct pharmacological and electrophysiological properties. Recent evidence, however, indicates that not all subunits can assemble efficiently with each other and form functional homo- or hetero-oligomeric receptors. In addition, the efficiency of formation of hetero-oligomeric assembly intermediates determines the subunit stoichiometry and subunit arrangement for each receptor and thus further reduces the possible heterogeneity of GABA(A) receptors in the brain. Studies investigating the subunit composition of native GABA(A) receptors support this conclusion, but also indicate that receptors composed of one, two, three, four, or five different subunits might exist in the brain. Using a recently established immunodepletion technique, the subunit composition and quantitative importance of native GABA(A) receptor subtypes can be determined. This information, together with studies on the regional, cellular and subcellular distribution of these receptor subtypes, will be the basis for a rational development of drugs that specifically affect the GABAergic system.},

Here we present the first three-dimensional structure, to our knowledge, of an inhibitory anion-selective Cys-loop receptor, the homopentameric Caenorhabditis elegans glutamate-gated chloride channel $\alpha$ (GluCl), at 3.3 {\AA} resolution. The X-ray structure of the GluCl-Fab complex was determined with the allosteric agonist ivermectin and in additional structures with the endogenous neurotransmitter L-glutamate and the open-channel blocker picrotoxin. Ivermectin, used to treat river blindness, binds in the transmembrane domain of the receptor and stabilizes an open-pore conformation. Glutamate binds in the classical agonist site at subunit interfaces, and picrotoxin directly occludes the pore near its cytosolic base. GluCl provides a framework for understanding mechanisms of fast inhibitory neurotransmission and allosteric modulation of Cys-loop receptors.},

Here we present the X-ray structure at 2.9 A resolution of the bacterial Gloeobacter violaceus pentameric ligand-gated ion channel homologue (GLIC) at pH 4.6 in an apparently open conformation. This cationic channel is known to be permanently activated by protons. The structure is arranged as a funnel-shaped transmembrane pore widely open on the outer side and lined by hydrophobic residues. On the inner side, a 5 A constriction matches with rings of hydrophilic residues that are likely to contribute to the ionic selectivity. Structural comparison with ELIC, a bacterial homologue from Erwinia chrysanthemi solved in a presumed closed conformation, shows a wider pore where the narrow hydrophobic constriction found in ELIC is removed. Comparative analysis of GLIC and ELIC reveals, in concert, a rotation of each extracellular beta-sandwich domain as a rigid body, interface rearrangements, and a reorganization of the transmembrane domain, involving a tilt of the M2 and M3 alpha-helices away from the pore axis. These data are consistent with a model of pore opening based on both quaternary twist and tertiary deformation.},

abstract = {Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) are key players in the early events of electrical signal transduction at chemical synapses. The family codes for a structurally conserved scaffold of channel proteins that open in response to the binding of neurotransmitter molecules. All proteins share a pentameric organization of identical or related subunits that consist of an extracellular ligand-binding domain followed by a transmembrane channel domain. The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is the most thoroughly studied member of the pLGIC family (for recent reviews see refs 1-3). Two sources of structural information provided an architectural framework for the family. The structure of the soluble acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP) defined the organization of the extracellular domain and revealed the chemical basis of ligand interaction. Electron microscopy studies of the nAChR from Torpedo electric ray have yielded a picture of the full-length protein and have recently led to the interpretation of an electron density map at 4.0 A resolution. Despite the wealth of experimental information, high-resolution structures of any family member have so far not been available. Until recently, the pLGICs were believed to be only expressed in multicellular eukaryotic organisms. The abundance of prokaryotic genome sequences, however, allowed the identification of several homologous proteins in bacterial sources. Here we present the X-ray structure of a prokaryotic pLGIC from the bacterium Erwinia chrysanthemi (ELIC) at 3.3 A resolution. Our study reveals the first structure of a pLGIC at high resolution and provides an important model system for the investigation of the general mechanisms of ion permeation and gating within the family.},

abstract = {Aggregation is a social behavior that varies between and within species, providing a model to study the genetic basis of behavioral diversity. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, aggregation is regulated by environmental context and by two neuromodulatory pathways, one dependent on the neuropeptide receptor NPR-1 and one dependent on the TGF-$\beta$ family protein DAF-7. To gain further insight into the genetic regulation of aggregation, we characterize natural variation underlying behavioral differences between two wild-type C. elegans strains, N2 and CB4856. Using quantitative genetic techniques, including a survey of chromosome substitution strains and QTL analysis of recombinant inbred lines, we identify three new QTLs affecting aggregation in addition to the two known N2 mutations in npr-1 and glb-5. Fine-mapping with near-isogenic lines localized one QTL, accounting for 5{\%}-8{\%} of the behavioral variance between N2 and CB4856, 3' to the transcript of the GABA neurotransmitter receptor gene exp-1. Quantitative complementation tests demonstrated that this QTL affects exp-1, identifying exp-1 and GABA signaling as new regulators of aggregation. exp-1 interacts genetically with the daf-7 TGF-$\beta$ pathway, which integrates food availability and population density, and exp-1 mutations affect the level of daf-7 expression. Our results add to growing evidence that genetic variation affecting neurotransmitter receptor genes is a source of natural behavioral variation.},
