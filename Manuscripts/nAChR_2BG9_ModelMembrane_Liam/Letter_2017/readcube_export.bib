abstract = {The effects of lipids on the maintenance of characteristic functional properties of the acetylcholine receptor during the course of reconstitution into lipid vesicles were studied by following the kinetics of agonist-induced state transitions. The requirements for successful preservation of these properties could be dissected into two components: (a) adequate nature and concentration of lipids during detergent solubilization; (b) correct lipid environment during reincorporation into lipid vesicles by the cholate dialysis procedure. Optimal bulk lipid concentrations and lipid:cholate ratios for preserving state transitions during solubilization were studied by using both crude soybean lipids and pure synthetic phospholipids. The latter class of lipids was found to be unsuitable substitutes for the crude soybean lipids, irrespective of their polar head group and/or fatty acyl chain, even when detergent:lipid ratios as high as 1:1 (w/w) were employed. Addition of cholesteryl hemisuccinate was able to make up this deficiency, attaining preservation of acetylcholine receptor state transitions at cholate:steroid ratios of about 6:1 (w/w). The presence of steroid decreased the amount of protein solubilized. The correct choice of lipid type was also essential to the reincorporation step, and higher concentrations of lipid were required--about 20 mg/mL for soybean lipids. Pure phospholipids at similar concentrations, however, were unable to maintain the state transitions. Again, steroid (40-46{\%} cholesteryl hemisuccinate/mol of total lipid) provided the adequate conditions at the reincorporation stage and enhanced the amount of protein reincorporated into the vesicles. A large (70-90{\%}) percentage of the receptor was reincorporated with the correct vectorial sidedness. No specificity could be detected for the phospholipid polar head or alkyl chain in relation to any of these findings. The effect of the protein on the physical state of the lipids in the reconstituted vesicles was studied by diphenylhexatriene fluorescence depolarization. The results may be interpreted as a disordering of the acyl chains in the gel state and an ordering in the liquid-crystalline state in the presence of protein, accompanied by shifts in the transition temperatures of the pure phospholipids to lower values.},

abstract = {The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) is the archetype molecule in the superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels (LGIC). Members of this superfamily mediate fast intercellular communication in response to endogenous neurotransmitters. This review is focused on the structural and functional crosstalk between the AChR and lipids in the membrane microenvironment, and the modulation exerted by the latter on ligand binding and ion translocation. Experimental approaches using Laurdan extrinsic fluorescence and F{\"{o}}rster-type resonance energy transfer (FRET) that led to the characterization of the polarity and molecular dynamics of the liquid-ordered phase AChR-vicinal lipids and the bulk membrane lipids, and the asymmetry of the AChR-rich membrane are reviewed first. The topological relationship between protein and lipid moieties and the changes in physical properties induced by exogenous lipids are discussed next. This background information lays the basis for understanding the occurrence of lipid sites in the AChR transmembrane region, and the selectivity of the protein-lipid interactions. Changes in FRET efficiency induced by fatty acids, phospholipid and cholesterol (Chol), led to the identification of discrete sites for these lipids on the AChR protein, and electron-spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy has recently facilitated determination of the stoichiometry and selectivity for the AChR of the shell lipid. The influence of lipids on AChR function is discussed next. Combined single-channel and site-directed mutagenesis data fostered the recognition of lipid-sensitive residues in the transmembrane region, dissecting their contribution to ligand binding and channel gating, opening and closing. Experimental evidence supports the notion that the interface between the protein moiety and the adjacent lipid shell is the locus of a variety of pharmacologically relevant processes, including the action of steroids and other lipids. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Although the Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) reconstituted into phosphatidylcholine (PC) membranes lacking cholesterol and anionic lipids adopts a conformation where agonist binding is uncoupled from channel gating, the underlying mechanism remains to be defined. Here, we examine the mechanism behind lipid-dependent uncoupling by comparing the propensities of two prokaryotic homologs, GLIC and ELIC, to adopt a similar uncoupled conformation. Membrane-reconstituted GLIC and ELIC both exhibit folded structures in the minimal PC membranes that stabilize an uncoupled nAChR. GLIC, with a large number of aromatic interactions at the interface between the outermost transmembrane $\alpha$-helix, M4, and the adjacent transmembrane $\alpha$-helices, M1 and M3, retains the ability to flux cations in this uncoupling PC membrane environment. In contrast, ELIC, with a level of aromatic interactions intermediate between that of the nAChR and GLIC, does not undergo agonist-induced channel gating, even though it does not exhibit the expected biophysical characteristics of the uncoupled state. Engineering new aromatic interactions at the M4-M1/M3 interface to promote effective M4 interactions with M1/M3, however, increases the stability of the transmembrane domain to restore channel function. Our data provide direct evidence that M4 interactions with M1/M3 are modulated during lipid sensing. Aromatic residues strengthen M4 interactions with M1/M3 to reduce the sensitivities of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels to their surrounding membrane environment.},

abstract = {Ontologies and rules play a central role in the development of the Semantic Web. Recent research in this context focuses especially on highly scalable formalisms for the Web of Data, which may highly benefit from exploiting database technologies. In this paper, as a first step towards closing the gap between the Semantic Web and databases, we introduce a family of expressive extensions of Datalog, called Datalog±, as a new paradigm for query answering over ontologies. The Datalog± family admits existentially quantified variables in rule heads, and has suitable restrictions to ensure highly efficient ontology querying. We show in particular that Datalog± encompasses and generalizes the tractable description logic EL and the DL-Lite family of tractable description logics, which are the most common tractable ontology languages in the context of the Semantic Web and databases. We also show how stratified negation can be added to Datalog± while keeping ontology querying tractable. Furthermore, the Datalog± family is of interest in its own right, and can, moreover, be used in various contexts such as data integration and data exchange. It paves the way for applying results from databases to the context of the Semantic Web.},

abstract = {The presence of lipid rafts in the membranes of living cells remains hotly disputed despite their incontrovertible existence in liposomes at 298 K. In attempts to resolve this debate, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been extensively used to study lipid phase separation at high resolution. However, computation has been of limited utility in this respect because the experimental distributions of phases in lamellar lipid mixtures are poorly reproduced by simulations. In particular, all-atom (AA) approaches suffer from restrictions on accessible timescales and system sizes whereas the more efficient coarse-grained (CG) force fields remain insufficiently accurate to achieve correspondence with experiment. In this work, we refine the CG Martini parameters for the high- and low-melting temperature (Tm) lipids 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC).

abstract = {G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are located in membranes rich in cholesterol. The membrane spanning surfaces of GPCRs contain exposed backbone carbonyl groups and residue side chains potentially capable of forming hydrogen bonds to cholesterol molecules buried deep within the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations allow the observation of GPCRs in cholesterol-containing lipid bilayers for long times (50 $\mu$s), sufficient to ensure equilibration of the system. We have detected a number of deep cholesterol binding sites on $\beta$2adrenergic and A2Aadenosine receptors, and shown changes in these sites on agonist binding. The requirements for binding are modest, just a potential hydrogen bond partner close to a cleft or hole in the surface. This makes it likely that similar binding sites for cholesterol will exist on other classes of membrane protein.},

abstract = {The state of aggregation of potassium channel KcsA was determined as a function of lipid:protein molar ratio in bilayer membranes of the zwitterionic lipid phosphatidylcholine (PC) and of the anionic lipid phosphatidylglycerol (PG). EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) with spin-labeled phospholipids was used to determine the number of motionally restricted lipids per KcsA tetramer. Unexpectedly, this number decreased with a decreasing lipid:KcsA tetramer molar ratio in the range of 88:1 to 30:1, consistent with sharing of annular lipid shells and KcsA-KcsA contact at high mole fractions of protein. Fluorescence quenching experiments with brominated phospholipids showed a decrease in fluorescence quenching at low lipid:KcsA tetramer mole ratios, also consistent with KcsA-KcsA contact at high mole fractions of protein. The effects of low mole ratios of lipid seen in EPR and fluorescence quenching experiments were more marked in bilayers of PC than in bilayers of PG, suggesting stronger association of PG than PC with KcsA. This was confirmed by direct measurement of lipid association constants using spin-labeled phospholipids, showing higher association constants for all anionic lipids than for PC. The results show that the probability of contacts between KcsA tetramers will be very low at lipid:protein molar ratios that are typical of native biological membranes.},

The fluorescence emission spectrum of Dauda bound to KcsA in bilayers of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine contains three components, which can be attributed to KcsA-bound and lipid-bound Dauda together with unbound Dauda. The binding of Dauda to KcsA was characterized by a dissociation constant of 0.47 ± 0.10 $\mu$M with 0.94 ± 0.06 binding site per KcsA tetramer. Displacement of KcsA-bound Dauda by the tetrabutylammonium (TBA) ion confirmed that the Dauda binding site was in the central cavity of KcsA. Dissociation constants for a range of fatty acids were determined by displacement of Dauda: binding of fatty acids increased in strength with an increasing chain length from C14 to C20 but then decreased in strength from C20 to C22. Increasing the number of double bonds in the chain from one to four had little effect on binding, dissociation constants for oleic acid and arachidonic acid, for example, being 2.9 ± 0.2 and 3.0 ± 0.4 $\mu$M, respectively. Binding of TBA to KcsA was very slow, whereas binding of Dauda was fast, suggesting that TBA can enter the cavity only through an open channel whereas Dauda can bind to the closed channel, presumably entering the cavity via the lipid bilayer.},

abstract = {The lateral mobility of surface receptors can define the signaling properties of a synapse and rapidly change synaptic function. Here we use single-particle tracking with Quantum Dots to follow nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on the surface of chick ciliary ganglion neurons in culture. We find that both heteropentameric alpha3-containing receptors (alpha3*-nAChRs) and homopentameric alpha7-containing receptors (alpha7-nAChRs) access synaptic domains by lateral diffusion. They have comparable mobilities and display Brownian motion in extrasynaptic space but are constrained and move more slowly in synaptic space. The two receptor types differ in the nature of their synaptic restraints. Disruption of lipid rafts, PDZ-containing scaffolds, and actin filaments each increase the mobility of alpha7-nAChRs in synaptic space while collapse of microtubules has no effect. The opposite is seen for alpha3*-nAChRs where synaptic mobility is increased only by microtubule collapse and not the other manipulations. Other differences are found for regulation of alpha3*-nAChR and alpha7-nAChR mobilities in extrasynaptic space. Most striking are effects on the immobile populations of alpha7-nAChRs and alpha3*-nAChRs. Disruption of either lipid rafts or PDZ scaffolds renders half of the immobile alpha3*-nAChRs mobile without changing the proportion of immobile alpha7-nAChRs. Similar results were obtained with chick sympathetic ganglion neurons, though regulation of receptor mobility differed in at least one respect from that seen with ciliary ganglion neurons. Control of nAChR lateral mobility, therefore, is determined by mechanisms that are domain specific, receptor subtype dependent, and cell-type constrained. The outcome is a system that could tailor nicotinic signaling capabilities to specific needs of individual locations.},

abstract = {Synapse efficacy heavily relies on the number of neurotransmitter receptors available at a given time. In addition to the equilibrium between the biosynthetic production, exocytic delivery and recycling of receptors on the one hand, and the endocytic internalization on the other, lateral diffusion and clustering of receptors at the cell membrane play key roles in determining the amount of active receptors at the synapse. Mobile receptors traffic between reservoir compartments and the synapse by thermally driven Brownian motion, and become immobilized at the peri-synaptic region or the synapse by: (a) clustering mediated by homotropic inter-molecular receptor-receptor associations; (b) heterotropic associations with non-receptor scaffolding proteins or the subjacent cytoskeletal meshwork, leading to diffusional "trapping," and (c) protein-lipid interactions, particularly with the neutral lipid cholesterol. This review assesses the contribution of some of these mechanisms to the supramolecular organization and dynamics of the paradigm neurotransmitter receptor of muscle and neuronal cells -the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). Currently available information stemming from various complementary biophysical techniques commonly used to interrogate the dynamics of cell-surface components is critically discussed. The translational mobility of nAChRs at the cell surface differs between muscle and neuronal receptors in terms of diffusion coefficients and residence intervals at the synapse, which cover an ample range of time regimes. A peculiar feature of brain $\alpha$7 nAChR is its ability to spend much of its time confined peri-synaptically, vicinal to glutamatergic (excitatory) and GABAergic (inhibitory) synapses. An important function of the $\alpha$7 nAChR may thus be visiting the territories of other neurotransmitter receptors, differentially regulating the dynamic equilibrium between excitation and inhibition, depending on its residence time in each domain.},

Cholesterol removal by methyl-$\beta$-cyclodextrin (M$\beta$CD) induced an increase in the frequency of miniature end-plate potentials (MEPPs) and spontaneous destaining of synaptic vesicles labeled with the styryl dye FM1-43. Treatment with M$\beta$CD also increased the size of MEPPs without causing significant changes in nicotinic receptor clustering. At the ultrastructural level, synaptic vesicles from nerve terminals treated with M$\beta$CD were larger than those from control. In addition, treatment with M$\beta$CD reduced the fusion of synaptic vesicles that are mobilized during KCl-evoked stimulation, but induced recycling of those vesicles that fuse spontaneously. We therefore suggest that M$\beta$CD might favor the release of vesicles that belong to a pool that is different from that involved in the KCl-evoked release. These results reveal fundamental differences in the synaptic vesicle cycle for spontaneous and evoked release, and suggest that deregulation of cholesterol affects synaptic vesicle biogenesis and increases transmitter packing.},

abstract = {The ionotropic 5HT(3) receptor was expressed in transiently transfected mammalian cells, yielding an unprecedented high concentration of up to 12 million receptors per cell. Receptor traffic in the plasma membrane of live cells was observed continuously over 24 h by fluorescence scanning confocal microscopy. This was possible by using 5HT(3) receptor-specific fluorescent ligands with high binding affinity and low off-rate to pulse label receptors at any time after appearance on the cell surface, and label subsequently those receptors expressed later by another, spectrally distinguishable, high-affinity fluorescent ligand. Having reached a critical cell surface concentration of approximately 3000 receptors/microm(2), the receptors started to aggregate in patches with a 4-fold increased surface concentration. The clusters were constantly delivered from a pool of freshly expressed receptors isotropically distributed within the basolateral region of the cell membrane. From there, they migrated to and accumulated on the apical cell surface approximately 9 h after transfection. Individual clusters grew until they reached a critical size of 1-2 microm when they merged to form with 3-5 microm large macroclusters. Clustered receptors were immobile on the minute time scale but always coexisted with monomeric receptors in the regions surrounding the clusters as revealed by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Because the receptor density of 12 000 receptors/microm(2) in the patches is as high as that found in two-dimensional crystals of certain membrane proteins, such patches might be a proper source for direct crystallization of membrane proteins without prior purification.},

Deterioration in the quality of sperm worldwide is the recent scenario and one of its reasons is testicular ischemic/ reperfusion (IR) injury. Therefore the present study aims at producing new drugs for the treatment of testicular IR injury. Methods: 42 animals were selected for the study and divided into 7 groups, each containing 6 rats. Bioflavonoids were tested for their efficacy in reversing the damage done to the testicular tissue by causing testicular torsion and detorsion in rats. As oxidative stress produced in the above condition causes tissue damage, MDA level was measured and antioxidant enzymes SOD and catalse were evaluated. Histological examination was conducted to find the extent of damage and the protective effect of rutin and naringin. One-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc test were used for data analysis. A p-value{\textless}0.001 was considered statistically significant. Results: MDA levels increased and antioxidant enzymes decreased drastically in the group of rats with testicular torsion and detorsion which clearly indicates a rise in oxidative stress (68{\%} rise in the case of MDA and 20{\%} and 16{\%} decrease in SOD and catalase concentrations, respectively). Rutin and naringin-treated groups showed the beneficial effects of the medicinal drugs, particularly in higher doses. Rutin, 10 mg/kg, was effective when compared to naringin in providing protection. Compared to the animals in the control group, there was a 30{\%} reduction in MDA levels and a 20{\%} increment in SOD levels plus a five-fold increase in catalse in the rutin-treated group (10 mg/kg). Histological examination supported the above claims. Conclusion: Oxidative stress in testicular injury affects the quality of sperm. Rutin and naringin in higher doses protected testicular tissue effectively. Further studies in this direction may prove beneficial.},

abstract = {Rapsyn, a peripheral membrane protein of skeletal muscle, clusters nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) at high density in the postsynaptic membrane. The mechanism of nAChR clustering by rapsyn was analyzed by expressing nAChRs in HEK293T cells with various fragments of mouse rapsyn fused to green fluorescent protein. Membrane targeting of rapsyn is conferred solely by its acylated N terminus, as the myristoylated N-terminal 15 amino acids of rapsyn are sufficient to target green fluorescent protein to the plasma membrane. However, neither N-terminal myristoylation nor the conserved N-terminal amino acid sequence is essential. Membrane targeting, self-association, and nAChR clustering are preserved when the first 10 amino acids of rapsyn were replaced by those of src, which also contains a consensus sequence for N-myristoylation, or by those of GAP43, which contains a palmitoylation sequence. Rapsyn1-90, containing two tetratrichopeptide repeats is sufficient for self-association. Rapsyn1-360, lacking the cysteine rich domain, clusters nAChRs, while rapsyn1-287, containing seven tetratrichopeptide repeats, does not cluster nAChRs. We identified rapsyn298-331 as a potential coiled-coil domain, and established that mutations disrupting coiled-coil propensity prevent nAChR clustering. Thus the structural domains of rapsyn necessary for membrane targeting, self-association, and nAChR clustering are distinct, with nAChR-rapsyn interaction mediated by a previously unrecognized coiled-coil motif.},

abstract = {The activities of integral membrane proteins are often affected by the structures of the lipid molecules that surround them in the membrane. One important parameter is the hydrophobic thickness of the lipid bilayer, defined by the lengths of the lipid fatty acyl chains. Membrane proteins are not rigid entities, and deform to ensure good hydrophobic matching to the surrounding lipid bilayer. The structure of the lipid headgroup region is likely to be important in defining the structures of those parts of a membrane protein that are located in the lipid headgroup region. A number of examples are given where the conformation of the headgroup-embedded region of a membrane protein changes during the reaction cycle of the protein; activities of such proteins might be expected to be particularly sensitive to lipid headgroup structure. Differences in hydrogen bonding potential and hydration between the headgroups of phosphatidycholines and phosphatidylethanolamines could be important factors in determining the effects of these lipids on protein activities, as well as any effects related to the tendency of the phosphatidylethanolamines to form a curved, hexagonal HIIphase. Effects of lipid structure on protein aggregation and helix-helix interactions are also discussed, as well as the effects of charged lipids on ion concentrations close to the surface of the bilayer. Interpretations of lipid effects in terms of changes in protein volume, lipid free volume, and curvature frustration are also described. Finally, the role of non-annular, or 'co-factor' lipids, tightly bound to membrane proteins, is described. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Recent research in this context focuses especially on highly scalable formalisms for the Web of Data, which may highly benefit from exploiting database technologies. In this paper, as a first step towards closing the gap between the Semantic Web and databases, we introduce a family of expressive extensions of Datalog, called Datalog±, as a new paradigm for query answering over ontologies. The Datalog± family admits existentially quantified variables in rule heads, and has suitable restrictions to ensure highly efficient ontology querying. We show in particular that Datalog± encompasses and generalizes the tractable description logic EL and the DL-Lite family of tractable description logics, which are the most common tractable ontology languages in the context of the Semantic Web and databases. We also show how stratified negation can be added to Datalog± while keeping ontology querying tractable. Furthermore, the Datalog± family is of interest in its own right, and can, moreover, be used in various contexts such as data integration and data exchange. It paves the way for applying results from databases to the context of the Semantic Web.},

abstract = {The effects of glycosylation and membrane environment on the structural stability of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) from Torpedo have been investigated to improve our understanding of factors that influence eukaryotic membrane protein crystallization. Gel shift assays and carbohydrate-specific staining show that the deglycosylation enzyme, Endo F1, removes at least 50{\%} of membrane-reconstituted nAChR glycosylation. The extent of deglycosylation with Endo F1 increases upon detergent solubilization. Removal of between 60-100{\%} of high mannose moieties from the nAChR has no effect on nAChR secondary structure, stability, or flexibility. Deglycosylation does not influence either agonist binding or the ability of the nAChR to undergo agonist-induced conformational change. In contrast, nAChR structural stability, flexibility, and function are all negatively influenced by simple changes in reconstituted membrane lipid composition. Our results suggest that deglycosylation may represent a feasible approach for enhancing the crystallizability of the nAChR. Our data also demonstrate that the dependence of nAChR structural stability on lipid environment may represent a significant obstacle to nAChR crystallization. Some membrane proteins may have evolved complex interactions with their lipid environments. Understanding the complexity of these interactions may be essential for devising an appropriate strategy for the crystallization of some membrane proteins. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Torpedo acetylcholine receptor was reconstituted into liposomes of pure synthetic lipids in order to study the influence of the lipid environment on affinity state transitions and the ion translocation function of the receptor. A critical concentration of 30 to 40{\%} of cholesteryl hemisuccinate was necessary in liposomes made of cholesteryl hemisuccinate and dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine to mimic the kinetics of agonist-induced state transitions observed in native membranes. With increasing chain length of the saturated lecithins, a marked increase in carbamylcholine dissociation constants was observed. Substitution by other dimyristoyl phospholipids for dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine had the same, though quantitatively less pronounced effects. Introduction of unsaturation in the acyl chains reverted the effect of increasing chain length. Unsaturated phosphatidylethanolamines in combination with 28-35 mol{\%} of cholesteryl hemisuccinate was the best lipid mixture for reconstitution of the receptor-gating function. When phosphatidylethanolamine was replaced totally or partially by other phospholipids with the same or different acyl chain composition, a marked decrease of ion transport was apparent, even when similar vesicle size, receptor incorporation, and agonist-induced affinity transitions were obtained. Therefore, the maintenance of the affinity state transitions of the reconstituted receptor is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the manifestation of the ion-gating receptor activity. On the other hand, the more unsaturated the acyl chains of phosphatidylethanolamine are, the higher the response that was observed, suggesting that a critical lipid packing is essential for the ion translocation function of the receptor.},

@misc{Simons1997,
abstract = {A new aspect of cell membrane structure is presented, based on the dynamic clustering of sphingolipids and cholesterol to form rafts that move within the fluid bilayer. It is proposed that these rafts function as platforms for the attachment of proteins when membranes are moved around inside the cell and during signal transduction. In the prevailing view of cellular membrane structure, lipids in the bilayer function mainly as a solvent for membrane proteins 1. But in the fluid bilayer, different lipid species are asymmetrically distributed over the exoplasmic and cytoplasmic leaflets of the membrane 2. The lipids are also organized in the lateral dimension and impose more short-and long-range order than was previously recognized 3. This lateral organization probably results from preferential packing of sphingolipids and cholesterol into moving platforms , or rafts, onto which specific proteins attach within the bilayer. We now propose a model for membrane structure that describes the organization of these lipid microdomains and we present evidence that proteins can selectively be included or excluded from these microdomains. We conclude that the function of these microdomains is to serve as rafts for the transport of selected membranes or as relay stations in intracellular signalling. The concept In epithelial cells, plasma membranes are polarized into apical and basolateral domains 4 , with the former being enriched in sphingolipids (glycosphingolipids and sphingomyelin) and the latter in the glycerolipid phosphatidylcholine 2,5. Mixing of sphingolipids and phosphatidyl-choline, both of which are localized to the exoplasmic leaflet, is prevented by the tight junctions between the two cell-surface domains 2,5. Studies on the delivery of newly synthesized sphingolipids in epithelial MDCK cells showed that a simple glycosphingolipid, glucosylceramide, was preferentially transported to the apical membrane 5,6. To explain delivery to the apical domain, it was proposed that glycosphingolipid clusters formed within the exoplasmic leaflet of the Golgi membrane 5 : these microdomains were considered to be sorting centres for proteins destined for delivery to the apical plasma membrane. In support of this model, glycosylphosphatidylinositol(GPI)-anchored proteins use glyco-lipid anchors as apical sorting determinants 7. Moreover, caveolae, small invaginations of the plasma membrane that are devoid of clathrin coats and are present in many cell types 8 , contain clusters of glycosphingolipids 9 and need cholesterol to function 10. As caveolae may be involved in endocytosis 9 and transcytosis 11 , a function for sphingolipid rafts in membrane trafficking was plausible 12 .},

Colocalized domains have never been observed to spontaneously move out of registry. This result indicates that the lipid compositions in one leaflet are strongly coupled to compositions in the opposing leaflet. Predictions of the interleaflet coupling parameter, $\Lambda$, vary by a factor of 50. We measure the value of $\Lambda$ by applying high shear forces to supported lipid bilayers. This causes the upper leaflet to slide over the lower leaflet, moving domains out of registry. We find that the threshold shear stress required to deregister domains in the upper and lower leaflets increases with the inverse length of domains. We derive a simple, closed-form expression relating the threshold shear to $\Lambda$, and find $\Lambda$ = 0.016 ± 0.004 kBT/nm2.},

This can be attributed to two factors: the experimental challenges that arise from the difficult chemical nature of membrane proteins, and the unclear relationship between their activity and their native environment. New approaches are therefore required to address these challenges. Recent developments in mass spectrometry have shown that it is possible to study membrane proteins in a solvent-free environment and provide detailed insights into complex interactions, ligand binding and folding processes. Interestingly, not only detergent micelles but also lipid bilayer nanodiscs or bicelles can serve as a means for the gentle desolvation of membrane proteins in the gas phase. In this manner, as well as by direct addition of lipids, it is possible to study the effects of different membrane components on the structure and function of the protein components allowing us to add functional data to the least accessible part of the proteome.},

Activation of the TRPV4 channel has been implicated in endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation. Here, we studied the contribution of $\omega$-3 PUFAs to TRPV4 function by precisely manipulating the fatty acid content in Caenorhabditis elegans. By genetically depriving the worms of PUFAs, we determined that the metabolism of $\omega$-3 fatty acids is required for TRPV4 activity. Functional, lipid metabolome, and biophysical analyses demonstrated that $\omega$-3 PUFAs enhance TRPV4 function in human endothelial cells and support the hypothesis that lipid metabolism and membrane remodeling regulate cell reactivity. We propose a model whereby the eicosanoid's epoxide group location increases membrane fluidity and influences the endothelial cell response by increasing TRPV4 channel activity. $\omega$-3 PUFA-like molecules might be viable antihypertensive agents for targeting TRPV4 to reduce systemic blood pressure. Dietary $\omega$-3 fatty acids have beneficial cardiovascular effects, but their molecular targets remain largely unknown.

We determined a 3.25 {\AA} crystal structure of the GLIC-DHA complex in a potentially desensitized conformation. The DHA molecule is bound at the channel-periphery near the M4 helix and exerts a long-range allosteric effect on the pore across domain-interfaces. In this previously unobserved conformation, the extracellular-half of the pore-lining M2 is splayed open, reminiscent of the open conformation, while the intracellular-half is constricted, leading to a loss of both water and permeant ions. These findings, in combination with spin-labeling/EPR spectroscopic measurements in reconstituted-membranes, provide novel mechanistic details of desensitization in pentameric channels.},

abstract = {Voltage-gated ion channels are crucial for both neuronal and cardiac excitability. Decades of research have begun to unravel the intriguing machinery behind voltage sensitivity. Although the details regarding the arrangement and movement in the voltage-sensing domain are still debated, consensus is slowly emerging. There are three competing conceptual models: the helical-screw, the transporter, and the paddle model. In this review we explore the structure of the activated voltage-sensing domain based on the recent X-ray structure of a chimera between Kv1.2 and Kv2.1. We also present a model for the closed state. From this we conclude that upon depolarization the voltage sensor S4 moves {\~{}}13 {\AA} outwards and rotates {\~{}}180{\textordmasculine}, thus consistent with the helical-screw model. S4 also moves relative to S3b which is not consistent with the paddle model. One interesting feature of the voltage sensor is that it partially faces the lipid bilayer and therefore can interact both with the membrane itself and with physiological and pharmacological molecules reaching the channel from the membrane.

abstract = {In summary, we have shown that the conventional explanation for the site of action of a ligand which alters the conductance of a membrane ion channel is that the ligand interacts or binds with the ion channel protein, changing its conductance, is inadequate to explain the primary site of action of the antiarrhythmic n-3 PUFAs. We have shown that when a neutral asparagine is replaced by a positively charged lysine in the N406 amino acid site in the $\alpha$-subunit of the human cardiac sodium channel, the n-3 fatty acids lose their inhibitory action on the sodium current. The inadequacy of this finding to explain the primary site of action of the n-3 PUFAs is demonstrated by the inhibitory effect on all other cardiac ion channels, so far tested. We show that ion channels, which share no amino acid homology with the PUFAs, have their conductance also reduced in the presence of the PUFAs, Thus a more general conceptual framework or paradigm is needed to account for the broad action of the PUFAs on diverse different ion channels lacking amino acid homology. We have been testing the membrane tension hypothesis of Andersen and associates. According to this hypothesis, the fatty acids are not acting directly on the ion channel protein but accumulating in the phospholipid membrane in immediate juxtaposition to the site in the membrane where the ion channel protein penetrates the membrane phospholipid bilayer. This alters membrane tensions exerted by the phospholipid membrane on the ion channel, which in turn causes conformational changes in the ion channel, altering the conductance of the ion channel. Our preliminary data seem to support this membrane tension hypothesis. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

FFA are continuously being produced and degraded, and a feedback regulatory function has been attributed to their turnover. The massive increase observed under some pathological conditions, especially in brain, has been interpreted as a protective mechanism possibly operative on ion channels, which in some cases is of stimulatory nature and in other cases inhibitory. Here we discuss the correlation between the structure of FFA and their ability to modulate protein function, evaluating the influence of saturation/unsaturation, number of double bonds, and cis vs. trans isomerism. We further focus on the mechanisms of FFA modulation operating on voltage-gated and ligand-gated ion channel function, contrasting the still conflicting evidence on direct vs. indirect mechanisms of action.},

These substructures, identified in a 10 $\mu$s all-atom trajectory of liquid-ordered/liquid-disordered coexistence (Lo/Ld) are composed of saturated hydrocarbon chains packed with local hexagonal order and separated by interstitial regions enriched in cholesterol and unsaturated chains. Lipid hydrocarbon chain order parameters calculated from the Lo phase are in excellent agreement with 2H NMR measurements; the local hexagonal packing is also consistent with 1H-MAS NMR spectra of the Lo phase, NMR diffusion experiments, and small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering. The balance of cholesterol-rich to local hexagonal order is proposed to control the partitioning of membrane components into the Lo regions. The latter have been frequently associated with formation of so-called rafts, platforms in the plasma membranes of cells that facilitate interaction between components of signaling pathways.},

Such heterogeneities lead to demixing of lipid constituents and formation of distinct liquid domains in the membrane. We study lateral heterogeneities in terms of topological rearrangements of lipids to identify the liquid-liquid phase coexistence in model membranes. Using ideas from the physics of amorphous systems and glasses, we calculate the degree of nonaffine deformation associated with individual lipids to characterize the liquid-ordered (Lo) and liquid-disordered (Ld) regions in model lipid bilayers. We explore the usage of this method on all-atom and coarse-grained lipid bilayer trajectories. This method is helpful in defining the instantaneous Lo−Lddomain boundaries in complex multicomponent bilayer systems. The characterization is also used to highlight the effect of line-active molecules on the phase boundaries and domain mixing. Overall, we propose a framework to explore the molecular origin of spatial and dynamical heterogeneity in biomembrane systems, which can be exploited not only in computer simulations but also in experiments.},

Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations have been used to reveal the mechanisms of self-assembly of protein/membrane and protein/detergent complexes for representatives of two classes of membrane protein, namely, glycophorin (a simple $\alpha$-helical bundle) and OmpA (a $\beta$-barrel). The accuracy of the coarse-grained simulations is established via comparison with the equivalent atomistic simulations of self-assembly of protein/detergent micelles. The simulation of OmpA/bilayer self-assembly reveals how a folded outer membrane protein can be inserted in a bilayer. The glycophorin/bilayer simulation supports the two-state model of membrane folding, in which transmembrane helix insertion precedes dimer self-assembly within a bilayer. The simulations also suggest that a dynamic equilibrium exists between the glycophorin helix monomer and dimer within a bilayer. The simulated glycophorin helix dimer is remarkably close in struc...},

abstract = {The association of hemagglutinin (HA) with lipid rafts in the plasma membrane is an important feature of the assembly process of influenza virus A. Lipid rafts are thought to be small, fluctuating patches of membrane enriched in saturated phospholipids, sphingolipids, cholesterol and certain types of protein. However, raft-associating transmembrane (TM) proteins generally partition into Ld domains in model membranes, which are enriched in unsaturated lipids and depleted in saturated lipids and cholesterol. The reason for this apparent disparity in behavior is unclear, but model membranes differ from the plasma membrane in a number of ways. In particular, the higher protein concentration in the plasma membrane may influence the partitioning of membrane proteins for rafts. To investigate the effect of high local protein concentration, we have conducted coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG MD) simulations of HA clusters in domain-forming bilayers. During the simulations, we observed a continuous increase in the proportion of raft-type lipids (saturated phospholipids and cholesterol) within the area of membrane spanned by the protein cluster. Lateral diffusion of unsaturated lipids was significantly attenuated within the cluster, while saturated lipids were relatively unaffected. On this basis, we suggest a possible explanation for the change in lipid distribution, namely that steric crowding by the slow-diffusing proteins increases the chemical potential for unsaturated lipids within the cluster region. We therefore suggest that a local aggregation of HA can be sufficient to drive association of the protein with raft-type lipids. This may also represent a general mechanism for the targeting of TM proteins to rafts in the plasma membrane, which is of functional importance in a wide range of cellular processes.},

We determined a 3.25 {\AA} crystal structure of the GLIC-DHA complex in a potentially desensitized conformation. The DHA molecule is bound at the channel-periphery near the M4 helix and exerts a long-range allosteric effect on the pore across domain-interfaces. In this previously unobserved conformation, the extracellular-half of the pore-lining M2 is splayed open, reminiscent of the open conformation, while the intracellular-half is constricted, leading to a loss of both water and permeant ions. These findings, in combination with spin-labeling/EPR spectroscopic measurements in reconstituted-membranes, provide novel mechanistic details of desensitization in pentameric channels.},

Free energy calculations show that the enthalpic contribution due to the packing of the lipids drives the lateral sorting of the helices. Hydrophobic mismatch regulates the clustering into either small dynamic or large static aggregates.

abstract = {In this paper we report an X-ray diffraction study on the phase behavior of binary lipid mixtures of 1-palmitoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DHA-PE) and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) at low concentrations below 5.0 mol{\%} DHA-PE. Our results show that DHA-PE induces phase separation into a DHA rich liquid crystalline (L$\alpha$) phase and a DHA poor gel (L$\beta$′) phase at overall DHA-PE concentrations as low as 0.1 mol{\%}. In addition, we find that the structure of the L$\beta$′ phase, from which the DHA-PE molecules are largely excluded, is modified in the phase-separated state at low DHA-PE concentrations, with a decrease in bilayer thickness of 1.34 nm for 0.1 mol{\%} at room temperature, compared to pure DPPC bilayers. This result is contrary to that seen in similar studies on mono-unsaturated lipids where an increase in bilayer thickness is observed. The surprising effect of such low DHA-PE concentrations on membrane structure may be important in understanding the role of highly polyunsaturated lipids in biological membrane-based structures and similar artificial surfactant systems.},

abstract = {Background: $\alpha$7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are widely distributed throughout the central nervous system and are reported to have neuroprotective properties. $\alpha$7 nAChRs are expressed on astrocytes, which are key regulators of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in several neurodegenerative diseases. However, the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of astroglial $\alpha$7 nAChRs are not well studied. Therefore, we evaluated the role of astroglial $\alpha$7 nAChR activation in neuroinflammation. Methods: Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of $\alpha$7 nAChR activation were evaluated in an in vitro mouse model of neuroinflammation using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in primary astrocyte cultures. $\alpha$7 nAChR anti-inflammatory effects on the NF-$\kappa$B pathway were evaluated using ELISA, gene expression analysis, immunofluorescence, and western blotting. Antioxidant effect of $\alpha$7 nAChR activation on expression profiles of canonical Nrf2 target genes was examined by quantitative PCR and western blotting. The role of the Nrf2 pathway in $\alpha$7 nAChR-mediated anti-inflammatory response was evaluated using Nrf2 knockout astrocytes. Brain ex vivo NF-$\kappa$B luciferase signals were evaluated after treatment with an $\alpha$7 nAChR agonist in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-injected NF-$\kappa$B luciferase reporter mouse model. Results: Astrocytes treated with the $\alpha$7 nAChR partial agonist (GTS21) showed significantly reduced LPS-mediated secretion of inflammatory cytokines and this effect was reversed by the $\alpha$7 nAChR antagonist methyllycaconitine (MLA) and by knockdown of $\alpha$7 nAChR expression with a short hairpin RNA. Further, $\alpha$7 nAChR activation blocked LPS-mediated NF-$\kappa$B nuclear translocation indicating that the observed anti-inflammatory effect may be mediated through inhibition of the NF-$\kappa$B pathway. Treatment with GTS21 also upregulated canonical Nrf2 antioxidant genes and proteins suggesting antioxidant properties of $\alpha$7 nAChR in astrocytes. Using an astrocyte conditioned media approach, we demonstrated reduction in neuronal apoptosis when astrocytes were pretreated with GTS21. Finally, in an in vivo neuroinflammation model using LPS in NF-$\kappa$B luciferase reporter mice, we demonstrated reduction in LPS-induced NF-$\kappa$B activity and pro-inflammatory cytokines with GTS21 treatment in brain tissue. Conclusion: Our results suggest that activating astroglial $\alpha$7 nAChRs may have a role in neuroprotection by decreasing inflammation and oxidative stress, and therefore could have therapeutic implication for disease modifying treatments of neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {Emerging evidence indicates that hypnotic anesthetics affect immune function. Many anesthetics potentiate $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid A receptor (GABAAR) activation, and these receptors are expressed on multiple subtypes of immune cells, providing a potential mechanistic link. Like immune cells, airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells also express GABAARs, particularly isoforms containing $\alpha$4 subunits, and activation of these receptors leads to ASM relaxation. We sought to determine if GABAAR signaling modulates the ASM contractile and inflammatory phenotype of a murine allergic asthma model utilizing GABAAR $\alpha$4 subunit global knockout (KO; Gabra4(0/0)) mice. Wild type (WT) and Gabra4 KO mice were sensitized with house dust mite (HDM) antigen or exposed to phosphate buffered saline (PBS) intranasally 5 days/week for 3 weeks. Ex vivo tracheal rings from HDM-sensitized WT and Gabra4 KO mice exhibited similar magnitudes of acetylcholine-induced contractile force and isoproterenol-induced relaxation (p=n.s.; n=4). In contrast, in vivo airway resistance (flexiVent) was significantly increased in Gabra4 KO mice (p{\textless}0.05, n=8). Moreover, the Gabra4 KO mice demonstrated increased eosinophilic lung infiltration (p{\textless}0.05; n=4), and increased markers of lung T cell activation/memory (CD62L low, CD44 high; p{\textless}0.01, n=4). In vitro, Gabra4 KO CD4(+) cells produced increased cytokines and exhibited increased proliferation after stimulation of the T cell receptor as compared to WT CD4(+) cells. These data suggest that the GABAAR $\alpha$4 subunit plays a role in immune cell function during allergic lung sensitization. Thus, GABAAR $\alpha$4 subunit-specific agonists have the therapeutic potential to treat asthma via two mechanisms: direct ASM relaxation and inhibition of airway inflammation.},

abstract = {Certain types of nonpsychoactive cannabinoids can potentiate glycine receptors (GlyRs), an important target for nociceptive regulation at the spinal level. However, little is known about the potential and mechanism of glycinergic cannabinoids for chronic pain treatment. We report that systemic and intrathecal administration of cannabidiol (CBD), a major nonpsychoactive component of marijuana, and its modified derivatives significantly suppress chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain without causing apparent analgesic tolerance in rodents. The cannabinoids significantly potentiate glycine currents in dorsal horn neurons in rat spinal cord slices. The analgesic potency of 11 structurally similar cannabinoids is positively correlated with cannabinoid potentiation of the $\alpha$3 GlyRs. In contrast, the cannabinoid analgesia is neither correlated with their binding affinity for CB1 and CB2 receptors nor with their psychoactive side effects. NMR analysis reveals a direct interaction between CBD and S296 in the third transmembrane domain of purified $\alpha$3 GlyR. The cannabinoid-induced analgesic effect is absent in mice lacking the $\alpha$3 GlyRs. Our findings suggest that the $\alpha$3 GlyRs mediate glycinergic cannabinoid-induced suppression of chronic pain. These cannabinoids may represent a novel class of therapeutic agents for the treatment of chronic pain and other diseases involving GlyR dysfunction.},

abstract = {Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (n ACh Rs) are members of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel superfamily that play important roles in the control of neurotransmitter release in the central and peripheral nervous system. These receptors are important therapeutic targets for the development of drugs against a number of mental health disorders and for marketed smoking cessation aids. Unfortunately, drug discovery has been hampered by difficulties in obtaining sufficiently selective compounds. Together with functional complexity of the receptors, this has made it difficult to obtain drugs with sufficiently high-target to off-target affinity ratios. The recent and ongoing progress in structural studies holds promise to help understand structure-function relationships of n ACh R drugs at the atomic level. This will undoubtedly lead to the design of more efficient drugs with fewer side effects. As a high-resolution structure of a n ACh R is yet to be determined, structural studies are to a large extent based on acetylcholine-binding proteins ( ACh BPs) that despite low overall sequence identity display a high degree of conservation of overall structure and amino acids at the ligand-binding site. Further, ACh BPs reproduce relative binding affinities of ligands at n ACh Rs. Over the past decade, ACh BPs have been used extensively as models for n ACh Rs and have aided the understanding of drug receptor interactions at n ACh Rs significantly. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {The glycine receptor is a member of the Cys-loop receptor superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels and is implicated as a possible therapeutic target for the treatment of diseases such as alcoholism and inflammatory pain. In humans, four glycine receptor subtypes ($\alpha$1, $\alpha$2, $\alpha$3, and $\beta$) co-assemble to form pentameric channel proteins as either $\alpha$ homomers or $\alpha$$\beta$ heteromers. To date, few agents have been identified that can selectively modulate the glycine receptor, especially those possessing subtype specificity. We used a cell-based method of phage display panning, coupled with two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology in Xenopus laevis oocytes, to identify novel heptapeptide modulators of the $\alpha$1$\beta$ glycine receptor. This involved a panning procedure in which the phage library initially underwent subtractive panning against Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293 cells expressing alternative glycine receptor subtypes before panning the remaining library over HEK 293 cells expressing the target, the $\alpha$1$\beta$ glycine receptor. Peptides were identified that act with selectivity on $\alpha$1$\beta$ and $\alpha$3$\beta$, compared to $\alpha$2$\beta$, glycine receptors. In addition, peptide activity at the glycine receptor decreased when zinc was chelated by tricine, similar to previous observations of a decrease in ethanol's enhancing actions at the receptor in the absence of zinc. Comparisons of the amino acid sequences of heptapeptides capable of potentiating glycine receptor function revealed several consensus sequences that may be predictive of a peptide's enhancing ability.},

abstract = {Serotonin type 3 (5-HT(3)) receptors are pentameric ion channels belonging to the superfamily of Cys-loop receptors. Receptor activation either leads to fast excitatory responses or modulation of neurotransmitter release depending on their neuronal localisation. 5-HT(3) receptors are known to be expressed in the central nervous system in regions involved in the vomiting reflex, processing of pain, the reward system, cognition and anxiety control. In the periphery they are present on a variety of neurons and immune cells. 5-HT(3) receptors are known to be involved in emesis, pain disorders, drug addiction, psychiatric and GI disorders. Progress in molecular genetics gives direction to personalised medical strategies for treating complex diseases such as psychiatric and functional GI disorders and unravelling individual drug responses in pharmacogenetic approaches. Here we discuss the molecular basis of 5-HT(3) receptor diversity at the DNA and protein level, of which our knowledge has greatly extended in the last decade. We also evaluate their role in health and disease and describe specific case-control studies addressing the involvement of polymorphisms of 5-HT3 subunit genes in complex disorders and responses to drugs. Furthermore, we focus on the actual state of the pharmacological knowledge concerning not only classical 5-HT(3) antagonists--the setrons--but also compounds of various substance classes targeting 5-HT(3) receptors such as anaesthetics, opioids, cannabinoids, steroids, antidepressants and antipsychotics as well as natural compounds derived from plants. This shall point to alternative treatment options modulating the 5-HT(3) receptor system and open new possibilities for drug development in the future.},

to the investigation of their role in cell signaling, both in healthy and pathological cells. As a consequence, therapies based on the regulation of membrane lipid composition and structure have been recently developed. This novel field, known as Membrane Lipid Therapy, is growing and evolving rapidly, providing treatments that are now in use or that are being studied for their application to oncological disorders, Alzheimer's disease, spinal cord injury, stroke, diabetes, obesity, and neuropathic pain. This field has arisen from relevant discoveries on the behavior of membranes in recent decades, and it paves the way to adopt new approaches in modern pharmacology and nutrition. This innovative area will promote further investigation into membranes and the development of new therapies with molecules that target the cell membrane. Due to the prominent roles of membranes in the cells' physiology and the paucity of therapeutic approaches based on the regulation of the lipids they contain, it is expected that membrane lipid therapy will provide new treatments for numerous pathologies. The first on-purpose rationally designed molecule in this field, minerval, is currently being tested in clinical trials and it is expected to enter the market around 2020. However, it seems feasible that during the next few decades other membrane regulators will also be marketed for the treatment of human pathologies.

Diagnosis of Alzheimer-type disease was based on the presence of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in post-mortem sections. Several highly significant and specific differences were observed between the two groups. Adrenic acid (22:4 n-6) was three to four times higher in the grey matter but lower in the white matter in each of the three regions in the Alzheimer brains than in the control group. These alterations were compensated by reciprocal changes in 18:0 in the grey matter and 16:1 fatty acids in the white matter. There was no significant difference in the proportion of other fatty acids, including those of the n-6 and n-3 series, in either the grey or the white matter of any of the three regions of the two groups, except for a higher proportion of 22:6 n-3 in the parietal white matter in the Alzheimer patients. There was no significant relationship between the levels of the individual fatty acids and age at death. It is suggested that the alterations in the fatty acid composition observed in the brains of Alzheimer patients may be caused by an aberration in the system by which essential fatty acids are transported into the brain},

Furthermore, low serum DHA is a significant risk factor for the development of AD. The relative concentration of DHA and other fatty acids, however, in the plasma of AD patients compared with patients with other kinds of dementias (other dementias; OD), patients who are cognitively impaired but nondemented (CIND), or normal patients is not known. In this study we analyzed the total phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) fractions of plasma from patients diagnosed with AD, OD, or CIND and compared them with a group of elderly control subjects with normal cognitive functioning. Plasma phospholipid and PC levels of 20:5n-3, DHA, total n-3 fatty acids, and the n-3/n-6 ratio were lower in the AD, OD, and CIND groups. Plasma phospholipid 24:0 was lower in the AD, OD, and CIND groups as compared with the group of control patients, and total n-6 fatty acid levels were higher in the AD and CIND groups only. In the plasma PE fraction, levels of 20:5n-3, DHA, and the total n-3 fatty acid levels were significantly lower in the AD, OD, and CIND groups. DHA levels were lower in the lysoPC fraction of CIND individuals only. There were no other differences in the fatty acid compositions of the different phospholipid fractions. Therefore, in AD, OD, and CIND individuals, low levels of n-3 fatty acids in the plasma may be a risk factor for cognitive impairment and/or dementia. Interestingly, a decreased level of plasma DHA was not limited to the AD patients but appears to be common in cognitive impairment with aging},

The enthorinal cortex (EC) neurons connecting to the hippocampus play a critical role in learning and memory. Here, we have exposed mice to diets based on canola:soybean oils (40 : 10, g/kg) or safflower : corn oils (25 : 25, g/kg) to investigate the relationship between the lipid profile of brain fatty acids and the intrinsic properties of EC neurons. Consumption of canola : soybean oil-enriched diet led to the increase of the monounsaturated fatty acid oleic acid and to a decrease of arachidonic acid in ethanolamine glycerophospholipids of the white matter. We also found an important rise in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) within ethanolamine glycerophospholipids and phosphatidylserine of gray matter. The canola:soybean oil treatment led to a shorter duration of action potential (-21{\%}), a reduction in the duration of postsynaptic response (-21{\%}) and increased firing activity (+43{\%}). Data from additional experiments with animals fed DHA alone or DHA with canola oil suggested that dietary monounsaturated fatty acid may have contributed to these effects on EC neuron physiology. Since neuronal function within the enthorhinal-hippocampal loop is critical to learning and memory processes, the present data may provide a functional basis for the beneficial cognitive effects of canola oil-based diets.},

abstract = {Metabolic phenotyping corresponds to the large-scale quantitative and qualitative analysis of the metabolome i.e., the low-molecular weight {\textless}1 KDa fraction in biological samples, and provides a key opportunity to advance neurosciences. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry are the main analytical platforms used for metabolic profiling, enabling detection and quantitation of a wide range of compounds of particular neuro-pharmacological and physiological relevance, including neurotransmitters, secondary messengers, structural lipids, as well as their precursors, intermediates and degradation products. Metabolic profiling is therefore particularly indicated for the study of central nervous system by probing metabolic and neurochemical profiles of the healthy or diseased brain, in preclinical models or in human samples. In this review, we introduce the analytical and statistical requirements for metabolic profiling. Then, we focus on key studies in the field of metabolic profiling applied to the characterization of animal models and human samples of central nervous system disorders. We highlight the potential of metabolic profiling for pharmacological and physiological evaluation, diagnosis and drug therapy monitoring of patients affected by brain disorders. Finally, we discuss the current challenges in the field, including the development of systems biology and pharmacology strategies improving our understanding of metabolic signatures and mechanisms of central nervous system diseases.},

abstract = {$\alpha$-synuclein is a small protein abundantly expressed in the brain and located in synaptic terminals. The conversion of $\alpha$-synuclein into oligomers and fibrils is the hallmark of a range of neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. $\alpha$-synuclein is disordered in solution but can adopt an $\alpha$-helical conformation when bound to lipid membranes. This lipid-protein interaction plays an important role in its proposed biological function, i.e., synaptic plasticity, but can also entail the aggregation of the protein. Both the chemical properties of the lipids and the lipid-to-protein-ratio have been reported to modulate the aggregation propensity of $\alpha$-synuclein. In this review, the influence of changes in the nature and levels of lipids on the aggregation propensity of $\alpha$-synuclein in vivo and in vitro will be discussed within a common general framework. In particular, while biophysical measurements and kinetic analyses of the time courses of $\alpha$-synuclein aggregation in the presence of different types of lipid vesicles allow a mechanistic dissection of the influence of the lipids on $\alpha$-synuclein aggregation, biological studies of cellular and animal models of Parkinson's disease allow the determination of changes in lipid levels and properties associated with the disease.},

Therefore, measures to prevent the mani-festation, and treatments to ameliorate the symptoms, of these disorders are in high demand. Brain lipids determine the localization and function of proteins in the cell membrane of neurons. Lipids may also act as neurotransmitters or other signalling molecules. The lipid composition of the brain can be influenced by nutrition, environmental factors, and by behavioural activity. Thus, lipids represent a target for preven-tive medicine of psychiatric disorders. Here we review how brain lipids contribute to normal behaviour and to major psychiatric disorders with the focus on phospholipids/fatty acids, sphingolipids, and endo-cannabinoids. Accumulating evidence suggests a crucial role for membrane forming and signalling lipids in the brain in the etiopathologies of depression, bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, and drug addiction. Lipids also represent potential preventive interventions for these psychiatric disorders by either targeted dietary supplementation or pharmacological manipulation of lipid regulating enzymes.},

Recent advances in molecular genetics have revealed clinico-genetic heterogeneity of these disorders including their clinical and genetic overlap with other diseases of the nervous system. The systematic analysis of a large set of genes, including exome sequencing, is unmasking unusual phenotypes or inheritance modes associated with mutations in HSP genes and related genes involved in various neurological diseases. A new nosology may emerge after integration and understanding of these new data to replace the current classification. Collectively, functions of the known genes implicate the disturbance of intracellular membrane dynamics and trafficking as the consequence of alterations of cytoskeletal dynamics, lipid metabolism and organelle structures, which represent in fact a relatively small number of cellular processes that could help to find common curative approaches, which are still lacking.},

abstract = {Acetylcholine (ACh) was one of the first neurotransmitters to be discovered and is one of the most important in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS). ACh is produced by the enzyme choline acetyltransferase and its actions are mediated through two types of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) — the G protein-coupled muscarinic AChRs and the nicotinic AChRs (nAChRs). The nAChRs are ligand-gated ion channels that are present in both the PNS (at the skeletal neuromuscular junction and in the autonomic nervous system) and the CNS. They are integral membrane proteins involved in the rapid 'phasic' effects of ACh under conditions of brief release of this neurotransmitter that produce high local concentrations. nAChRs can also respond to low ACh concentrations, and are the target of tonically released ACh and of systemically applied pharmacological agents, including nicotine. Typically, activation of brain nAChRs results in enhanced release of various key neurotrans-mitters, including dopamine, serotonin, glutamate and GABA ($\gamma$-aminobutyric acid). Knowledge of the atomic structure, functional organ-ization and conformational transitions of the nAChRs has recently progressed to the extent that these recep-tors are now among the most well understood allosteric membrane proteins (that is, proteins that mediate signal transduction between topographically distinct sites, through a conformational change) 1 . This makes them an exceptional model to investigate the molecular mecha-nisms of drug–receptor interactions 2–7 . The acute effect of ACh consists of the fast opening (microsecond to milli-second range) of a cationic channel that is permeable to Na + , K + and sometimes Ca 2+ ions. Of key importance for drug design, chronic exposure to ACh or nicotinic drugs causes a gradual decrease in the rate of this ionic response (100 ms to minutes), leading to a high-affinity, desensitized, closed state of the receptor 5 . Many of the clinically used drugs that target nAChRs are administered for months, resulting in long-term changes in receptor properties and/or number. Chronic exposure to nico-tine causes a striking increase, typically by twofold, in the total number of high-affinity receptors — a process termed upregulation 8 . There is considerable interest in modulating nAChRs to treat various nervous-system disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and tobacco addiction 9–11 . This article first examines recent advances in our understanding of the assembly, activity and con-formational transitions of the nAChR 5,12 , highlighting the relevance of these discoveries to the design of novel, improved drugs that target nAChRs.

Dysfunction in the lipid homeostasis in the brain could be a risk factor for the many types of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These neurodegenerative disorders are marked by extensive neuronal apoptosis, gliosis, and alteration in the differentiation, proliferation, and development of neurons. Sphingomyelin, a constituent of plasma membrane, as well as its primary metabolite ceramide acts as a potential lipid second messenger molecule linked with the modulation of various cellular signaling pathways. Excessive production of reactive oxygen species associated with enhanced oxidative stress has been implicated with these molecules and involved in the regulation of a variety of different neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders. Studies have shown that alterations in the levels of plasma lipid/cholesterol concentration may result to neurodegenerative diseases. Alteration in the levels of inflammatory cytokines and mediators in the brain has also been found to be implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. Although several mechanisms involved in neuronal apoptosis have been described, the molecular mechanisms underlying the correlation between lipid metabolism and the neurological deficits are not clearly understood. In the present review, an attempt has been made to provide detailed information about the association of lipids in neurodegeneration especially in Alzheimer's disease.},

Understanding the basis for the modulation of GABAAR function requires high-resolution structures. Here we present the first atomic structures of a GABAAR chimera at 2.8-{\AA} resolution, including those bound with potentiating and inhibitory neurosteroids. These structures define new allosteric binding sites for these modulators that are associated with the $\alpha$-subunit transmembrane domain.

abstract = {Membrane lipids are potent modulators of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) from Torpedo. Lipids influence nAChR function by both conformational selection and kinetic mechanisms, stabilizing varying proportions of activatable versus non-activatable conformations, as well as influencing the transitions between these conformational States. Of note, some membranes stabilize an electrically silent uncoupled conformation that binds agonist but does not undergo agonist-induced conformational transitions. The uncoupled nAChR, however, does transition to activatable conformations in relatively thick lipid bilayers, such as those found in lipid rafts. In this review, we discuss current understanding of lipid-nAChR interactions in the context of increasingly available high resolution structural and functional data. These data highlight different sites of lipid action, including the lipid-exposed M4 transmembrane $\alpha$-helix. Current evidence suggests that lipids alter nAChR function by modulating interactions between M4 and the adjacent transmembrane $\alpha$-helices, M1 and M3. These interactions have also been implicated in both the folding and trafficking of nAChRs to the cell surface. We review current mechanistic understanding of lipid-nAChR interactions, and highlight potential biological roles for lipid-nAChR interactions in modulating the synaptic response.

They are oligomeric protein assemblies that convert a chemical signal into an ion flux through the postsynaptic membrane, but the molecular mechanism of gating ions has remained elusive. Here, we present atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of the prokaryotic channels from Gloeobacter violaceus (GLIC) and Erwinia chrysanthemi (ELIC), whose crystal structures are thought to represent the active and the resting states of pLGICs, respectively, and of the eukaryotic glutamate-gated chloride channel from Caenorhabditis elegans (GluCl), whose open-channel structure was determined complexed with the positive allosteric modulator ivermectin. Structural observables extracted from the trajectories of GLIC and ELIC are used as progress variables to analyze the time evolution of GluCl, which was simulated in the absence of ivermectin starting from the structure with bound ivermectin. The trajectory of GluCl with ivermectin removed shows a sequence of structural events that couple agonist unbinding from the extracellular domain to ion-pore closing in the transmembrane domain. Based on these results, we propose a structural mechanism for the allosteric communication leading to deactivation/activation of the GluCl channel. This model of gating emphasizes the coupling between the quaternary twisting and the opening/closing of the ion pore and is likely to apply to other members of the pLGIC family.},

  abstract = {Lipid rafts are subdomains of the plasma membrane that contain high concentrations of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids. They exist as distinct liquid-ordered regions of the membrane that are resistant to extraction with nonionic detergents. Rafts appear to be small in size, but may constitute a relatively large fraction of the plasma membrane. While rafts have a distinctive protein and lipid composition, all rafts do not appear to be identical in terms of either the proteins or the lipids that they contain. A variety of proteins, especially those involved in cell signaling, have been shown to partition into lipid rafts. As a result, lipid rafts are thought to be involved in the regulation of signal transduction. Experimental evidence suggests that there are probably several different mechanisms through which rafts control cell signaling. For example, rafts may contain incomplete signaling pathways that are activated when a receptor or other required molecule is recruited into the raft. Rafts may also be important in limiting signaling, either by physical sequestration of signaling components to block nonspecific interactions, or by suppressing the intrinsic activity of signaling proteins present within rafts.This review provides an overview of the physical characteristics of lipid rafts and summarizes studies that have helped to elucidate the role of lipid rafts in signaling via receptor tyrosine kinases and G protein-coupled receptors.},

The membranes contained cholesterol (0.158 mg per mg protein), phospholipids (0.714 mg per mg protein) and gangliosides (0.125 mg per mg protein) as major constituents while cerebrosides and sulphatides were present in only trace amounts. Analysis of the gangliosides by thin-layer chromatography showed that there was no selective enrichment of any individual type in the plasma membranes in relation to total brain. The major phospholipids were ethanolamine (34.2 {\%}), choline (41.6 {\%}) and serine (13.2 {\%}) phosphoglycerides. Inositol monophospho-glyceride (3.5 {\%}), sphingomyelin (5.1 {\%}) and lysolecithin (1.0 {\%}) were relatively minor components while phosphatidylglycerol was not present. Each phospholipid class showed a specific fatty acid composition which differed from that of the other phospholipids. This result extends the specific fatty acid compositions observed in grey matter and certain sub-fractions by other workers. In particular, choline phos-phoglycerides contained high levels of saturated fatty acids while large quantities of docosahexaenoic acid were present in ethanolamine and serine phosphoglycerides.},

Here we apply a simulation model to assess the molecular nature of these domains at the nanoscale, information that has thus far eluded experimental determination. We are able to show the spontaneous separation of a saturated phosphatidylcholine (PC)/unsaturated PC/cholesterol mixture into a liquid-ordered and a liquid-disordered phase with structural and dynamic properties closely matching experimental data. The near-atomic resolution of the simulations reveals remarkable features of both domains and the boundary domain interface. Furthermore, we predict the existence of a small surface tension between the monolayer leaflets that drives registration of the domains.

In the absence of anionic lipids and cholesterol, the nAChR adopts an uncoupled conformation, which binds agonist with resting state-like affinity but does not usually undergo agonist-induced conformational transitions. Very slow (minutes to hours) transitions from uncoupled to coupled (resting, open and/or desensitized) conformations, however, can occur in membranes with relatively thick hydrophobic cores. Increasing membrane hydrophobic thickness 'awakens' uncoupled nAChRs by reducing the large activation energy barrier (or barriers) leading to coupled states, thus allowing conformational transitions to occur on an experimentally tractable timescale. Lipids shape activity by modulating the relative proportions of activatable versus nonactivatable conformations and by controlling the transitions between uncoupled and coupled conformations.},

In addition to the bilayer spectrum, the spin label reported a more motionally restricted environment whose contribution increased with increasing protein/lipid ratio. Exchange between thses two environments occurred at a rate of approx. 6 {\textperiodcentered} 107s-1. The motionally restricted, protein-associated 14-PCSL had a rotational correlation time of about 10-20 ns, an order of magnitude slower than when in the bilayer. Addition of 1-hexanol (up to 16 mM) to the reconstituted receptor perturbed the acyl chains of the bulk lipid phase, but the motional properties of the lipid acyl chains at the protein/lipid interface near the membrane center were not significantly perturbed on the EPR motional time-scale. Similarly, anesthetics that were less effective at perturbing the bilayer, such as pentobarbital (up to 2 mM) and isoflurane (7 mM), did not perturb the lipid/protein interface on the conventional EPR motional time scale. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was used to study the action of ethanol on the protein side chain motions of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAcChoR) in alkaline extracted membranes from Torpedo nobiliana. EPR spectra of the nAcChoR derivatized with maleimide spin label contain both strongly and weakly immobilized components. The rotational correlation time of the strongly immobilized component decreases by a factor of 2-3-fold with the addition of 1.6 M ethanol, while that of the weakly immobilized component is not significantly altered. EPR spectroscopy was also used to probe the lipid environment immediately surrounding the nAcChoR with stearic acid and phosphatidylcholine spin labeled at the fourteenth acyl carbons (14-SASL and 14-PCSL, respectively), and the steroid spin label androstanol (ASL). EPR spectra of these probes reveal a component corresponding to lipids that are motionally restricted by the receptor (annular lipids) in addition to a more fluid component arising from bulk lipid. Using spectral subtraction, the order of selectivity of these spin labels for the nAcChoR was determined to be ASL {\textgreater} or = 14-SASL {\textgreater} 14-PCSL. The estimated rotational correlation times of the high affinity 14-SASL and ASL probes ranged from approx. 20 to 35 ns. The correlation times of the lower affinity 14-PCSL were generally shorter than those for 14-SASL and ASL and ranged from about 10 to 25 ns. The addition of up to 0.9 M ethanol altered neither the affinity nor the mobility of the motionally restricted EPR component. This suggests that ethanol's actions on the nAcChoR are not mediated via changes at the lipid/protein interface near the center of the bilayer.},

J Mol Biol 346:967-989]. Purified nAChR must be reconstituted in a mixture containing cholesterol to function. Proposed modes of interaction between cholesterol and the protein range from specific binding to indirect membrane-mediated mechanisms. However, the underlying cause of nAChR sensitivity to cholesterol remains controversial, in part because the vast majority of functional studies were conducted before a medium resolution structure was reported. We show that the nAChR contains internal sites capable of containing cholesterol, whose occupation stabilizes the protein structure. We detect sites at the protein-lipid interface as conventionally predicted from functional data, as well as deeply buried sites that are not usually considered. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that occupation of both superficial and deeply buried sites most effectively preserves the experimental structure; the structure collapses in the absence of bound cholesterol. In particular, we find that bound cholesterol directly supports contacts between the agonist-binding domain and the pore that are thought to be essential for activation of the receptor. These results likely apply to those other ion channels within the Cys-loop superfamily that depend on cholesterol, such as the GABA receptor.},

  abstract = {We present a refined model of the membrane-associated Torpedo acetylcholine (ACh) receptor at 4 {\AA} resolution. An improved experimental density map was obtained from 342 electron images of helical tubes, and the refined structure was derived to an R-factor of 36.7{\%} (Rfree37.9{\%}) by standard crystallographic methods, after placing the densities corresponding to a single molecule into an artificial unit cell. The agreement between experimental and calculated phases along the helical layer-lines was used to monitor progress in the refinement and to give an independent measure of the accuracy. The atomic model allowed a detailed description of the whole receptor in the closed-channel form, including the ligand-binding and intracellular domains, which have not previously been interpreted at a chemical level. We confirm that the two ligand-binding $\alpha$ subunits have a different extended conformation from the three other subunits in the closed channel, and identify several interactions on both pairs of subunit interfaces, and within the $\alpha$ subunits, which may be responsible for their "distorted" structures. The ACh-coordinating amino acid side-chains of the $\alpha$ subunits are far apart in the closed channel, indicating that a localised rearrangement, involving closure of loops B and C around the bound ACh molecule, occurs upon activation. A comparison of the structure of the $\alpha$ subunit with that of AChBP having ligand present, suggests how the localised rearrangement overcomes the distortions and initiates the rotational movements associated with opening of the channel. Both vestibules of the channel are strongly electronegative, providing a cation-stabilising environment at either entrance of the membrane pore. Access to the pore on the intracellular side is further influenced by narrow lateral windows, which would be expected to screen out electrostatically ions of the wrong charge and size. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs) constitute an important family of complex membrane proteins acting as receptors for neurotransmitters (Barnard, 1992; Ortells and Lunt, 1995). The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) from Torpedo is the most extensively studied member of the LGIC family and consists of a pentameric transmembrane glycoprotein composed of four different polypeptide subunits (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta) in a 2:1:1:1 stoichiometry (Galzi and Changeux, 1995; Hucho et al., 1996) that are arranged pseudosymmetrically around a central cation-selective ion channel. Conformational transitions, from the closed (nonconducting), to agonist-induced open (ion-conducting), to desensitized (nonconducting) states, are critical for functioning of the nAChR (Karlin, 2002). The ability of the nAChR to undergo these transitions is profoundly influenced by the lipid composition of the bilayer (Barrantes, 2004). Despite existing information on lipid dependence of AChR function, no satisfactory explanation has been given on the molecular events by which specific lipids exert such effects on the activity of an integral membrane protein. To date, several hypotheses have been entertained, including (1) indirect effects of lipids through the alteration of properties of the bilayer, such as fluidity (an optimal fluidity hypothesis [Fong and McNamee, 1986]) or membrane curvature and lateral pressure (Cantor, 1997; de Kruijff, 1997), or (2) direct effects through binding of lipids to defined sites on the transmembrane portion of the protein (Jones and McNamee, 1988; Blanton and Wang, 1990; Fernandez et al., 1993; Fernandez-Ballester et al., 1994), which has led to the postulation of a possible role of certain lipids as peculiar allosteric ligands of the protein. In this paper we have reconstituted purified AChRs from Torpedo into complex multicomponent lipid vesicles in which the phospholipid composition has been systematically altered. Stopped-flow rapid kinetics of cation translocation and Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy studies have been used to illustrate the lipid dependence of both AChR function and AChR secondary structure, respectively.},

The effects of lipids on the latter are discussed in the second part of the review.

  abstract = {Anionic lipids and cholesterols (CHOL) are critical to the function of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR). We investigated their interactions with an open- and closed-channel alpha4beta2 nAChR by over 10 ns molecular dynamics simulations in a ternary lipid mixture of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidic acid (POPA), and CHOL with a ratio of 3:1:1 (Haddadian et al., J. Phys. Chem. B 2008, 112, 13981). On average there were 65 and 74 interfacial lipids around the closed- and open-channel alpha4beta2 nAChR, respectively, in the equilibrated simulation systems. In the open-channel system, 42{\%} of the interfacial POPA had acyl chains partially inserted into intra- or intersubunit cavities, as compared to only 7{\%} in the closed-channel alpha4beta2. No CHOL was found in cavities within single subunits, though some CHOL infiltrated into the gaps between subunits. Because of its smaller headgroup, POPA could access some nonannular sites where POPC could not easily reach due to steric exclusion. Furthermore, POPA acted not only as an acceptor for hydrogen bonding (H bonding) as POPC did, but also as a donor through its hydroxyl group for H bonding with the backbone of the protein. The charged headgroup of POPA allowed the lipid to form stable salt bridges with conserved Arg and Lys residues at the interfaces of the transmembrane (TM) and extracellular (EC) or intracellular (IC) domains of the alpha4beta2. A higher number of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds (H bonds) between POPA and the alpha4beta2 nAChR were found in the open system than in the closed system, suggesting a potential role of POPA in the equilibrium between different channel states. Most interfacial POPA molecules showed lower order parameters than the bulk POPA due to the mixed effect of gauche defects, hydrophobic mismatch, and the lipid orientations near the magic angle. These unique properties enable the interfacial POPA to achieve what POPC cannot with regard to specific interactions with the protein, thereby making POPA essential for the function of nAChR.},

Earlier studies demonstrated that nAChRs reconstituted into membranes containing phosphatidylcholine (PC), the anionic lipid phosphatidic acid (PA), and cholesterol (CH) are particularly effective at stabilizing the nAChR in the resting (closed) state that is capable of undergoing agonist-induced conformational transitions (i.e., functionality). The present studies demonstrate that (1) there is no obligatory requirement for PC, (2) increasing the CH content serves to increase the degree to which nAChRs are stabilized in the resting state, and this effect saturates at approximately 35 mol {\%} (molar lipid percentage), and (3) the effect of increasing levels of PA saturates at approximately 12 mol {\%} and in the absence of PA nAChRs are stabilized in the desensitized state (i.e., nonfunctional). Native Torpedo membranes contain approximately 35 mol {\%} CH but less than 1 mol {\%} PA, suggesting that other anionic lipids may substitute for PA. We report that (1) phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol (PI), anionic lipids that are abundant in native Torpedo membranes, also stabilize the receptor in the resting state although with reduced efficacy (approximately 50-60{\%}) compared to PA, and (2) for nAChRs reconstituted into PA/CH membranes at different lipid-protein molar ratios, receptor functionality decreases rapidly below approximately 65 lipids per receptor. Collectively, these results are consistent with a functional requirement of a single shell of lipids surrounding the nAChR and specific anionic lipid- and sterol (CH)-protein interactions.},

Anesthetics inhibit the α4β2 {nAChR} at clinically relevant concentrations, but their binding sites in α4β2 remain unclear. The recently determined {NMR} structures of the α4β2 {nAChR} transmembrane {(TM)} domains provide valuable frameworks for identifying the binding sites. In this study, we performed solution {NMR} experiments on the α4β2 {TM} domains in the absence and presence of halothane and ketamine. Both anesthetics were found in an intra-subunit cavity near the extracellular end of the β2 transmembrane helices, homologous to a common anesthetic binding site observed in X-ray structures of anesthetic-bound {GLIC} {(Nury} et al., [32]). Halothane, but not ketamine, was also found in cavities adjacent to the common anesthetic site at the interface of α4 and β2. In addition, both anesthetics bound to cavities near the ion selectivity filter at the intracellular end of the {TM} domains. Anesthetic binding induced profound changes in protein conformational exchanges. A number of residues, close to or remote from the binding sites, showed resonance signal splitting from single to double peaks, signifying that anesthetics decreased conformation exchange rates. It was also evident that anesthetics shifted population of two conformations. Altogether, the study comprehensively resolved anesthetic binding sites in the α4β2 {nAChR.} Furthermore, the study provided compelling experimental evidence of anesthetic-induced changes in protein dynamics, especially near regions of the hydrophobic gate and ion selectivity filter that directly regulate channel functions.},

  abstract = {The existence of lipid rafts in biological membranes in vivo is still debated. In contrast, the formation of domains in model systems has been well documented. In giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) prepared from ternary mixtures of dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine/sphingomyelin/cholesterol, a clear separation of liquid-disordered and sphingomyelin-enriched, liquid-ordered phases could be observed. This phase separation can lead to the fission of the liquid-ordered phase from the vesicle. Here we show that in cholesterol-containing GUVs, the phase separation can involve dynamic redistribution of lipids from one phase into another as a result of a cross-linking perturbation. We found that the molecular structure of a sterol used for the preparation of GUVs determines (i) its ability to induce phase separation and (ii) the curvature (positive or negative) of the formed liquid-ordered phase. As a consequence, the latter can pinch off to the outside or inside of the vesicle. Remarkably, some mixtures of sterols induce liquid-ordered domains exhibiting both positive and negative curvature, which can lead to a new type of budding behavior in GUVs. Our findings could have implications for the role of sterols in various cell-biological processes such as budding of secretory vesicles, endocytosis, or formation of multivesicular bodies.},

  abstract={This study compares the lipid composition, including individual phospholipid molecular species of solubilized {nAChR} detergent complexes {(nAChR-DCs)} with those of the bulk lipids from their source, Torpedo californica {(Tc)} electric tissue. This lipidomic analysis revealed seventy-seven (77) phospholipid species in the Tc tissue. Analysis of affinity-purified {nAChR-DCs} prepared with C-12 to C-16 phospholipid analog detergents alkylphosphocholine {(FC)} and lysofoscholine {(LFC)} demonstrated that {nAChR-DCs} prepared with {FC12,} {LFC14,} and {LFC16} contained \{\textgreater\}60 {phospholipids/nAChR,} which was more than twice of those prepared with {FC14,} {FC16,} and {LFC12.} Significantly, all the {nAChR-DCs} lacked ethanolamine and anionic phospholipids, contained only four cholesterol molecules, and a limited number of phospholipid molecular species per {nAChR.} Upon incorporation into oocytes, {FC12} produce significant functionality, whereas {LFC14} and {LFC16} {nAChR-DCs} displayed an increased functionality as compared to the crude Tc membrane. All three {nAChR-DCs} displayed different degrees of alterations in macroscopic activation and desensitization kinetics.},

  abstract={Propofol, a widely used intravenous general anesthetic, acts at anesthetic concentrations as a positive allosteric modulator of γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors and at higher concentration as an inhibitor of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors {(nAChRs).} Here, we characterize propofol binding sites in a muscle-type {nAChR} by use of a photoreactive analog of propofol, {2-isopropyl-5-[3-(trifluoromethyl)-3H-diazirin-3-yl]phenol} {(AziPm).} Based upon radioligand binding assays, {AziPm} stabilized the Torpedo {nAChR} in the resting state, whereas propofol stabilized the desensitized state. {nAChR-rich} membranes were photolabeled with {[3H]AziPm,} and labeled amino acids were identified by Edman degradation. {[3H]AziPm} binds at three sites within the {nAChR} transmembrane domain: (i) an intrasubunit site in the δ subunit helix bundle, photolabeling in the {nAChR} desensitized state (+agonist) {δM2-18′} and two residues in {δM1} {(δPhe-232} and {δCys-236);} (ii) in the ion channel, photolabeling in the {nAChR} resting, closed channel state (−agonist) amino acids in the M2 helices {(αM2-6′,} {βM2-6′} and -13′, and {δM2-13′)} that line the channel lumen (with photolabeling reduced by \{\textgreater\}90\% in the desensitized state); and (iii) at the γ-α interface, photolabeling {αM2-10′.} Propofol enhanced {[3H]AziPm} photolabeling at {αM2-10′.} Propofol inhibited {[3H]AziPm} photolabeling within the δ subunit helix bundle at lower concentrations {(IC50} = 40 μm) than it inhibited ion channel photolabeling {(IC50} = 125 μm). These results identify for the first time a single intrasubunit propofol binding site in the {nAChR} transmembrane domain and suggest that this is the functionally relevant inhibitory binding site.},

  abstract={— Exposure to ethanol is known to alter cell membranes both chemically and biophysically; these effects may be related to the development of tolerance and physical dependence. In the present study, the effects of various concentrations of ethanol (1–250 {mM)} on the lipid composition after the first 6 days of Xenopus embryo development were investigated, using an in vitro fertilization technique. Lipid analysis revealed: (1) a decrease of the cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio mainly derived from a higher content of phospholipids; (2) an increase of phospholipid unsaturated fatty acids, especially C20:4 and C20:5, with ethanol concentration of 150–250 {mM;} (3) a decrease of lipid-bound sialic acid with ethanol concentrations of ≥5 {mM.} These results underline that sialoglycoconjugates are a more sensitive target of alcohol in comparison with other lipid components. The cultured embryo method certainly represents a useful model for investigation of the direct effects of ethanol on lipid metabolism, excluding maternal interference which can lead to misinterpretation of data.},

  abstract={Phase separation in biological membranes plays an important role in protein targeting and transmembrane signaling. Its occurrence in both membrane leaflets commonly gives rise to matching liquid or liquid-ordered domains in the opposing monolayers. The underlying mechanism of such co-localization is not fully understood. The decrease of the line tension around the thicker ordered domain constitutes an important driving force. Yet, robust domain coupling requires an additional energy source, which we have now identified as thermal undulations. Our theoretical analysis of elastic deformations in a lipid bilayer shows that stiffer lipid domains tend to distribute into areas with lower fluctuations of monolayer curvature. These areas naturally align in the opposing monolayers. Thus, coupling requires both membrane leafs to display a heterogeneity in splay rigidities. The heterogeneity may either originate from intrinsic lipid properties or be acquired by adsorption of peripheral molecules. Undulations and line tension act synergistically: the gain in energy due a minimized line tension is proportional to domain radius and thus primarily fuels the registration of smaller domains; whereas the energetic contribution of undulations increases with membrane area and thus primarily acts to coalesce larger domains.},

It had high efficacy but low potency for {\&\#x3B1;7} receptors, and the best potency and good efficacy for {\&\#x3B1;4\&\#x3B2;2} receptors. Cytisine, a key lead compound for the development of smoking cessation agents, is a full agonist for both mammalian {\&\#x3B1;7} and {\&\#x3B1;3\&\#x3B2;4} receptors, but a full agonist only for the fish {\&\#x3B1;7,} with surprisingly low efficacy for {\&\#x3B1;3\&\#x3B2;4.} The efficacy of cytisine for {\&\#x3B1;4\&\#x3B2;2} was somewhat greater than typically reported for mammalian {\&\#x3B1;4\&\#x3B2;2.} The ganglionic blocker mecamylamine was most potent for blocking {\&\#x3B1;3\&\#x3B2;4} receptors, least potent for {\&\#x3B1;7,} and roughly equipotent for the muscle receptors and the {\&\#x3B2;2-containing} {nAChR.} However, the block of {\&\#x3B2;2-containing} receptors was slowly reversible, consistent with effective targeting of these {CNS-type} receptors in vivo. Three prototypical {\&\#x3B1;7-selective} agonists, choline, tropane, and {4OH-GTS-21,} were tested, and these agents were observed to activate both fish {\&\#x3B1;7} and {\&\#x3B1;4\&\#x3B2;2} {nAChR.} Our data therefore indicate that while some pharmacological tools used in zebrafish may function as expected, others will not.},

@article{Bermdez_Partition_2010,
  abstract = {The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) is in intimate contact with the lipids in its native membrane. Here we analyze the possibility that it is the intrinsic properties of the AChR that determine its partition into a given lipid domain. Torpedo AChR or a synthetic peptide corresponding to the AChR M4 segment (the one in closer contact with lipids) was reconstituted into "raft"-containing model membranes. The distribution of the AChR was assessed by Triton X-100 extraction in combination with fluorescence studies, and lipid analyses were performed on each sample. The influence of rapsyn, a peripheral protein involved in AChR aggregation, was studied. Raft-like domain aggregation was also studied using membranes containing the ganglioside GM1 followed by GM1 crosslinking. The gammaM4 peptide displays a marked preference for raft-like domains. In contrast, AChR alone or in the presence of rapsyn or ganglioside aggregation exhibits no such preference for raft-like domains, but it does cause a significant reduction in the total amount of these domains. The results indicate that the distribution of the AChR in lipid domains cannot be due exclusively to the intrinsic physicochemical properties of the protein and that there must be an external signal in native cell membranes that directs the AChR to a specific membrane domain.},

  abstract = {We present an elastic Hamiltonian for membrane energetics that captures bilayer undulation and peristaltic deformations over all wavelengths, including the short wavelength protrusion regime. The model implies continuous functional forms for thermal undulation and peristaltic amplitudes as a function of wavelength and predicts previously overlooked relationships between these curves. Undulation and peristaltic spectra display excellent agreement with data from both atomistic and coarse-grained models over all simulated length scales. Additionally, the model accurately predicts the bilayer's response to a cylindrical protein inclusion as observed in coarse-grained simulation. This elastic response provides an explanation for gramicidin ion channel lifetime versus membrane thickness data that requires no fit constants. The physical parameters inherent to this picture may be expressed in terms of familiar material properties associated with lipid monolayers. Inclusion of a finite monolayer spontaneous curvature is essential to obtain fully consistent agreement between theory and the full range of available simulation/experimental data. {\textcopyright} 2006 by the Biophysical Society.},

AChR distribution was evaluated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer efficiency between the AChR intrinsic fluorescence and Laurdan or dehydroergosterol fluorescence, and by analyzing the distribution of AChR in detergent-resistant and detergent-soluble fractions (1{\%} Triton X-100, 4 °C). bSM-induced transbilayer asymmetry or the presence of 16:0-SM and/or 18:0-SM (unlike bSM or 24:1-SM) resulted in the preferential partitioning of AChR in Lo domains, suggesting that the localization of AChR in ordered domains strongly depends on the characteristics of the host lipid membrane, and in particular on the sphingolipid composition and transbilayer asymmetry.},

In its most severe form, it leads to death before the age of 2 years. While primary degeneration of motor neurons is well established in this disease, and this results in neurogenic atrophy of skeletal muscle, we have previously reported evidence for a primary muscle defect. In this study, we used primary cultures of embryonic human skeletal muscle cells from patients with SMA and from controls to examine the effects of muscle fiber differentiation in the absence of a nerve component. Cultured SMA skeletal muscle cells are unable to fuse correctly to form multinuclear myotubes, the precursors of the myofibers. We also show that agrin-induced aggregates of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, one of the earliest steps of neuromuscular junction formation, cannot be visualized by confocal microscopy on cells from SMA patients. In binding experiments, we demonstrate that this lack of clustering is due to defective expression of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the myotubes of SMA patients whereas the affinity of alpha-bungarotoxin for its receptor remains unchanged regardless of muscle cell type (SMA or control). These observations suggest that muscle cells from SMA patients have intrinsic abnormalities that may affect proper formation of the neuromuscular junction.},

These findings have been attributed to the ability of nicotine to act as a neuroprotective agent. A large number of studies demonstrate that nicotine can protect against neuronal death in vitro and in vivo, and the mechanisms underlying the ability of nicotine to protect against excitotoxicity and amyloid-? toxicity are beginning to be elucidated. Despite the compelling evidence that nicotine is neuroprotective, it is clear that nicotine can be toxic under some circumstances. The balance between nicotine neuroprotection and toxicity depends on dose, developmental stage and regimen of administration. Therefore, a full understanding of the molecular and cellular effects of nicotine on signaling pathways relevant to neuronal survival is critical for informed drug discovery of nicotinic compounds to combat human neurodegeneration. This review summarizes recent studies related to the mechanisms underlying nicotine-mediated neuroprotection, and addresses issues that are relevant to use of nicotine as a neuroprotective agent in vivo.},

In the present study, autopsy tissue from the temporal cortex of 14 AD cases and 15 age-matched control subjects was compared using immunoblotting with antibodies against recombinant peptides specific for alpha3, alpha4, and alpha7 subunits, in conjunction with [3H]epibatidine binding. Antibodies to alpha3, alpha4, and alpha7 produced one major band on western blots at 59, 51, and 57 kDa, respectively. [3H]Epibatidine binding and alpha4-like immunoreactivity (using antibodies against the extracellular domain and cytoplasmic loop of the alpha4 subunit) were reduced in AD cases compared with control subjects (p {\textless} 0.02) and with a subgroup of control subjects (n = 9) who did not smoke prior to death (p {\textless} 0.05) for the former two parameters. [3H]Epibatidine binding and cytoplasmic alpha4-like immunoreactivity were significantly elevated in a subgroup of control subjects (n = 4) known to have smoked prior to death (p {\textless} 0.05). There were no significant changes in alpha3- or alpha7-like immunoreactivity associated with AD or tobacco use. The selective involvement of alpha4 has implications for understanding the role of nicotinic receptors in AD and potential therapeutic targets.},

  abstract = {The synapse is a localized neurohumoral contact between a neuron and an effector cell and may be considered the quantum of fast intercellular communication. Analogously, the postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor may be considered the quantum of fast chemical to electrical transduction. Our understanding of postsynaptic receptors began to develop about a hundred years ago with the demonstration that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve released acetylcholine and slowed the heart beat. During the past 50 years, advances in understanding postsynaptic receptors increased at a rapid pace, owing largely to studies of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) at the motor endplate. The endplate AChR belongs to a large superfamily of neurotransmitter receptors, called Cys-loop receptors, and has served as an exemplar receptor for probing fundamental structures and mechanisms that underlie fast synaptic transmission in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Recent studies provide an increasingly detailed picture of the structure of the AChR and the symphony of molecular motions that underpin its remarkably fast and efficient chemoelectrical transduction.},

  abstract = {Lipid rafts are nanoscopic assemblies of sphingolipids, cholesterol, and specific membrane proteins that contribute to lateral heterogeneity in eukaryotic membranes. Separation of artificial membranes into liquid-ordered (Lo) and liquid-disordered phases is regarded as a common model for this compartmentalization. However, tight lipid packing in Lo phases seems to conflict with efficient partitioning of raft-associated transmembrane (TM) proteins. To assess membrane order as a component of raft organization, we performed fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy with the membrane probes Laurdan and C-laurdan. First, we assessed lipid packing in model membranes of various compositions and found cholesterol and acyl chain dependence of membrane order. Then we probed cell membranes by using two novel systems that exhibit inducible phase separation: giant plasma membrane vesicles [Baumgart et al. (2007) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 104:3165-3170] and plasma membrane spheres. Notably, only the latter support selective inclusion of raft TM proteins with the ganglioside GM1 into one phase. We measured comparable small differences in order between the separated phases of both biomembranes. Lateral packing in the ordered phase of giant plasma membrane vesicles resembled the Lo domain of model membranes, whereas the GM1 phase in plasma membrane spheres exhibited considerably lower order, consistent with different partitioning of lipid and TM protein markers. Thus, lipid-mediated coalescence of the GM1 raft domain seems to be distinct from the formation of a Lo phase, suggesting additional interactions between proteins and lipids to be effective.},

  abstract = {The scaffolding protein at the neuromuscular junction, rapsyn, enables clustering of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in high concentration and is critical for muscle function. Patients with insufficient receptor clustering suffer from muscle weakness. However, the detailed organization of the receptor–rapsyn net-work is poorly understood: it is unclear whether rapsyn first forms a wide meshwork to which receptors can subsequently dock or whether it only forms short bridges linking receptors together to make a large cluster. Furthermore, the number of rapsyn-binding sites per receptor (a heteropentamer) has been controversial. Here, we show by cryoelectron tomography and subtomogram averaging of Torpedo postsynaptic membrane that receptors are connected by up to three rapsyn bridges, the minimum number required to form a 2D network. Half of the receptors belong to rapsyn-connected groups comprising between two and fourteen receptors. Our results provide a structural basis for explaining the stability and low diffusion of receptors within clusters. cryoelectron microscopy | neurotransmitter receptor clustering | synapse | ligand-gated ion channel | tetratricopeptide repeat T he cytoplasmic protein rapsyn, also known as the 43K pro-tein, interacts with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the postsynaptic membrane at the neuromuscular junction, forming clusters where receptors are present in high concentration. Such clustering is necessary for efficient neurotransmission and, hence, muscle functioning. Rapsyn-deficient mice fail to form clusters, show severe muscle weakness and breathing difficulties, and die within hours after birth (1). Furthermore, many patients suffering from congenital myasthenic syndrome are found to have muta-tions in rapsyn (2). Rapsyn is a 43-kDa protein containing a myristoylation site necessary for submembrane localization, seven tetratricopeptide repeats (TRPs), a putative coiled-coil domain, and a RING-H2 domain (3). Two TPRs are necessary for rapsyn self-association, whereas association with receptor depends on the predicted coiled-coil (3, 4). Rapsyn is also linked through the RING-H2 domain to dystroglycan, a protein that indirectly binds actin cy-toskeleton (5). Recombinant rapsyn expressed in heterologous systems spontaneously aggregates underneath the plasma mem-brane (3), suggesting that rapsyn might first form a wide scaffold to which receptors can subsequently dock (6). On the other hand, rapsyn and the receptor are cotransported in membrane vesicles toward the plasma membrane, and the receptor is necessary for rapsyn clustering in C2 myotubes, raising the possibility that rapsyn only forms short bridges linking receptors together to form a large cluster (7–9). Furthermore, the number of rapsyn-binding sites per receptor (a heteropentamer) has been variously esti-mated to be between one and five (6, 10, 11). Therefore, the molecular details and organization of the receptor–rapsyn net-work are poorly understood. To address these issues, we applied cryoelectron tomography, combined with subtomogram averaging and image classification, to postsynaptic membranes isolated from the electric organ of Torpedo marmorata: a model system for the neuromuscular junction (12, 13). Three-dimensional structures were obtained of acetylcholine receptors complexed with rapsyn molecules in sev-eral specific arrangements. We show that the receptors connect to each other by small rapsyn bridges and that each receptor can have up to three bridges, the minimum number required to form a 2D network.},

  abstract = {Modulation of the GABA type A receptor (GABAAR) function by cholesterol and other steroids is documented at the functional level, yet its structural basis is largely unknown. Current data on structurally related modulators suggest that cholesterol binds to subunit interfaces between transmembrane domains of the GABAAR. We construct homology models of a human GABAAR based on the structure of the glutamate-gated chloride channel GluCl of Caenorhabditis elegans. The models show the possibility of previously unreported disulfide bridges linking the M1 and M3 transmembrane helices in the $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ subunits. We discuss the biological relevance of such disulfide bridges. Using our models, we investigate cholesterol binding to intersubunit cavities of the GABAAR transmembrane domain. We find that very similar binding modes are predicted independently by three approaches: analogy with ivermectin in the GluCl crystal structure, automated docking by AutoDock, and spontaneous rebinding events in unbiased molecular dynamics simulations. Taken together, the models and atomistic simulations suggest a somewhat flexible binding mode, with several possible orientations. Finally, we explore the possibility that cholesterol promotes pore opening through a wedge mechanism. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

  abstract = {Emerging concepts of membrane organization point to the compartmentalization of the plasma membrane into distinct lipid microdomains. This lateral segregation within cellular membranes is based on cholesterol-sphingolipid-enriched microdomains or lipid rafts which can move laterally and assemble into large-scale domains to create plasma membrane specialized cellular structures at specific cell locations. Such domains are likely involved in the genesis of the postsynaptic specialization at the neuromuscular junction, which requires the accumulation of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), through activation of the muscle specific kinase MuSK by the neurotropic factor agrin and the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. We used C2C12 myotubes as a model system to investigate whether agrin-elicited AChR clustering correlated with lipid rafts. In a previous study, using two-photon Laurdan confocal imaging, we showed that agrin-induced AChR clusters corresponded to condensed membrane domains: the biophysical hallmark of lipid rafts [F. Stetzkowski-Marden, K. Gaus, M. Recouvreur, A. Cartaud, J. Cartaud, Agrin elicits membrane condensation at sites of acetylcholine receptor clusters in C2C12 myotubes, J. Lipid Res. 47 (2006) 2121-2133]. We further demonstrated that formation and stability of AChR clusters depend on cholesterol. We also reported that three different extraction procedures (Triton X-100, pH 11 or isotonic Ca++, Mg++ buffer) generated detergent resistant membranes (DRMs) with similar cholesterol/GM1 ganglioside content, which are enriched in several signalling postsynaptic components, notably AChR, the agrin receptor MuSK, rapsyn and syntrophin. Upon agrin engagement, actin and actin-nucleation factors such as Arp2/3 and N-WASP were transiently recovered within raft fractions suggesting that the activation by agrin can trigger actin polymerization. Taken together, the present data suggest that AChR clustering at the neuromuscular junction relies upon a mechanism of raft coalescence driven by agrin-elicited actin polymerization. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The channels open transiently upon the binding of a neurotransmitter released from the presynaptic nerve terminal, eliciting an electrical response. Membrane lipids also play a vital but poorly understood role in this process of synaptic transmission.

A segregated distribution of lipid molecules is found in the outer leaflet of the bilayer. Apparent cholesterol-rich patches are located in specific annular regions next to the transmembrane helices and also in a more extended `microdomain' between the apposed $\delta$ subunits of neighbouring receptors. The particular lipid distribution can be interpreted straightforwardly in relation to the gating movements revealed by an earlier time-resolved cryo-EM study, in which the membranes were exposed briefly to ACh. The results suggest that in addition to stabilizing the protein, cholesterol may play a mechanical role by conferring local rigidity to the membrane so that there is productive coupling between the extracellular and membrane domains, leading to opening of the channel. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Levental_Polyunsaturated_2016,
  abstract = {The plasma membrane (PM) serves as the functional interface between a cell and its environment, hosting extracellular signal transduction and nutrient transport among a variety of other processes. To support this extensive functionality, PMs are organized into lateral domains, including ordered, lipid-driven assemblies termed lipid rafts. Although the general requirements for ordered domain formation are well established, how these domains are regulated by cell-endogenous mechanisms or exogenous perturbations has not been widely addressed. In this context, an intriguing possibility is that dietary fats can incorporate into membrane lipids to regulate the properties and physiology of raft domains. Here, we investigate the effects of polyunsaturated fats on the organization of membrane domains across a spectrum of membrane models, including computer simulations, synthetic lipid membranes, and intact PMs isolated from mammalian cells. We observe that the $\omega$-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid is robustly incorporated into membrane lipids, and this incorporation leads to significant remodeling of the PM lipidome. Across model systems, docosahexaenoic acid-containing lipids enhance the stability of ordered raft domains by increasing the order difference between them and coexisting nonraft domains. The relationship between interdomain order disparity and the stability of phase separation holds for a spectrum of different perturbations, including manipulation of cholesterol levels and high concentrations of exogenous amphiphiles, suggesting it as a general feature of the organization of biological membranes. These results demonstrate that polyunsaturated fats affect the composition and organization of biological membranes, suggesting a potential mechanism for the extensive effects of dietary fat on health and disease.},

A comprehensive approach, beginning with ab-initio quantum chemical studies of model compounds representing segments of DHA and ending with large scale classical molecular dynamics simulations of DHA-containing bilayers, is described with particular attention paid to contrasting the properties of DHA with those of saturated fatty acids. Connection with experiment is made primarily through comparison with Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) studies, particularly those that probe details of the chain structure and dynamics.

Particularly striking is the result that up to 40\% cholesterol does not increase the bending modulus {K(C)} of membranes composed of phosphatidylcholine lipids with two cis monounsaturated chains, although it does have the expected stiffening effect on membranes composed of lipids with two saturated chains. The B fluctuational modulus in the smectic liquid crystal theory is obtained and used to discuss the interactions between bilayers. Our {K(C)} results motivate a theory of elastic moduli in the high cholesterol limit and they challenge the relevance of universality concepts. Although most of our results were obtained at 30 degrees C , additional data at other temperatures to allow consideration of a reduced temperature variable do not support universality for the effect of cholesterol on all lipid bilayers. If the concept of universality is to be valid, different numbers of saturated chains must be considered to create different universality classes.

  abstract={Micropipette pressurization of giant bilayer vesicles was used to measure both elastic bending k(c) and area stretch {K(A)} moduli of fluid-phase phosphatidylcholine {(PC)} membranes. Twelve diacyl {PCs} were chosen: eight with two 18 carbon chains and degrees of unsaturation from one double bond {(C18:1/0,} C18:0/1) to six double bonds per lipid {(diC18:3),} two with short saturated carbon chains {(diC13:0,} {diC14:0),} and two with long unsaturated carbon chains {(diC20:4,} {diC22:1).} Bending moduli were derived from measurements of apparent expansion in vesicle surface area under very low tensions (0.001-0.5 {mN/m),} which is dominated by smoothing of thermal bending undulations. Area stretch moduli were obtained from measurements of vesicle surface expansion under high tensions (\&gt;0.5 {mN/m),} which involve an increase in area per molecule and a small-but important-contribution from smoothing of residual thermal undulations. The direct stretch moduli varied little (\&lt; +/-10\%) with either chain unsaturation or length about a mean of 243 {mN/m.} On the other hand, the bending moduli of saturated/monounsaturated chain {PCs} increased progressively with chain length from 0.56 x 10(-19) J for {diC13:0} to 1.2 x 10(-19) J for {diC22:1.} However, quite unexpectedly for longer chains, the bending moduli dropped precipitously to approximately 0.4 x 10(-19) J when two or more cis double bonds were present in a chain {(C18:0/2,} {diC18:2,} {diC18:3,} {diC20:4).} Given nearly constant area stretch moduli, the variations in bending rigidity with chain length and polyunsaturation implied significant variations in thickness. To test this hypothesis, peak-to-peak headgroup thicknesses h(pp) of bilayers were obtained from x-ray diffraction of multibilayer arrays at controlled relative humidities. For saturated/monounsaturated chain bilayers, the distances h(pp) increased smoothly from {diC13:0} to {diC22:1} as expected. Moreover, the distances and elastic properties correlated well with a polymer brush model of the bilayer that specifies that the elastic ratio {(k(c)/K(A))(1/2)} = (h(pp) - h(o))/24, where h(o) approximately 1 nm accounts for separation of the headgroup peaks from the deformable hydrocarbon region. However, the elastic ratios and thicknesses for {diC18:2,} {diC18:3,} and {diC20:4} fell into a distinct group below the correlation, which showed that poly-cis unsaturated chain bilayers are thinner and more flexible than saturated/monounsaturated chain bilayers.},

  abstract={The effects of both neutral and anionic lipids on the structure of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor {(nAChR)} have been probed using infrared difference spectroscopy. The difference between infrared spectra of the {nAChR} recorded using the attenuated total reflectance technique in the presence and absence of the neurotransmitter analog, carbamylcholine, exhibits a complex pattern of positive and negative bands that provides a spectral map of the structural changes that occur in the {nAChR} upon ligand binding and subsequent desensitization. This spectral map is essentially identical in difference spectra recorded from native, native alkaline-extracted, and affinity-purified {nAChR} reconstituted into either soybean asolectin or egg phosphatidylcholine membranes containing both neutral and anionic lipids. This result suggests both a similar structure of the {nAChR} and a similar resting to desensitized conformational change in each membrane environment. In contrast, difference spectra recorded from the {nAChR} reconstituted into egg phosphatidylcholine membranes lacking neutral and/or anionic lipids all exhibit an essentially identical pattern of band intensity variations, which is similar to the pattern of variations observed in difference spectra recorded in the continuous presence of the desensitizing local anesthetic, dibucaine. The difference spectra suggest that the main effect of both neutral and anionic lipids in a reconstituted egg phosphatidylcholine membrane is to help stabilize the {nAChR} in a resting conformation. In the absence of neutral and/or anionic lipids, the {nAChR} is converted into an alternate conformation that appears to be analogous to the local anesthetic-induced desensitized state. Significantly, the proportion of receptors found in the resting versus the putative desensitized state appears to be dependent upon the final lipid composition of the reconstituted membrane. A lipid-dependent modulation of the equilibrium between a channel-active resting and channel-inactive desensitized state may account for the modulations of {nAChR} activity that are observed in different lipid membranes.},

Based on large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we provide a high-resolution view of the lipid organization of a plasma membrane at an unprecedented level of complexity. Our plasma membrane model consists of 63 different lipid species, combining 14 types of headgroups and 11 types of tails asymmetrically distributed across the two leaflets, closely mimicking an idealized mammalian plasma membrane. We observe an enrichment of cholesterol in the outer leaflet and a general non-ideal lateral mixing of the different lipid species. Transient domains with liquid-ordered character form and disappear on the microsecond time scale. These domains are coupled across the two membrane leaflets. In the outer leaflet, distinct nanodomains consisting of gangliosides are observed. Phosphoinositides show preferential clustering in the inner leaflet. Our data provide a key view on the lateral organization of lipids in one of life's fundamental structures, the cell membrane.},

abstract = {Although general anesthetics are known to modulate the activity of ligand-gated ion channels in the Cys-loop superfamily, there is at present neither consensus on the underlying mechanisms, nor predictive models of this modulation. Viable models need to offer quantitative assessment of the relative importance of several identified anesthetic binding sites. However, to date, precise affinity data for individual sites has been challenging to obtain by biophysical means. Here, the likely role of pore block inhibition by the general anesthetics isoflurane and propofol of the prokaryotic pentameric channel GLIC is investigated by molecular simulations. Microscopic affinities are calculated for both single and double occupancy binding of isoflurane and propofol to the GLIC pore. Computations are carried out for an open-pore conformation in which the pore is restrained to crystallographic radius, and a closed-pore conformation that results from unrestrained molecular dynamics equilibration of the structure. The GLIC pore is predicted to be blocked at the micromolar concentrations for which inhibition by isofluorane and propofol is observed experimentally. Calculated affinities suggest that pore block by propofol occurs at signifcantly lower concentrations than those for which inhibition is observed: we argue that this discrepancy may result from binding of propofol to an allosteric site recently identified by X-ray crystallography, which may cause a competing gain-of-function effect. Affinities of isoflurane and propofol to the allosteric site are also calculated, and shown to be 3 mM for isoflurane and 10 $\mu$M for propofol; both anesthetics have a lower affinity for the allosteric site than for the unoccupied pore.},

  abstract={In order to investigate experimentally inaccessible, molecular-level detail regarding interleaflet interaction in membranes, we have run an extensive series of coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of phase separated lipid bilayers. The simulations are motivated by differences in lipid and cholesterol composition in the inner and outer leaflets of biological membranes. Over the past several years, this phenomenon has inspired a series of experiments in model membrane systems which have explored the effects of lipid compositional asymmetry in the two leaflets. The simulations are directed at understanding one potential consequence of compositional asymmetry, that being regions of bilayers where liquid-ordered {(L(o))} domains in one leaflet are opposite liquid-disordered {(L(d))} domains in the other leaflet (phase asymmetry). The simulated bilayers are of two sorts: 1) Compositionally symmetric leaflets where each of the two leaflets contains an identical, phase separated {(L(o)/L(d))} mixture of cholesterol, saturated and unsaturated phospholipid; and 2) Compositionally asymmetric leaflets, where one leaflet contains a phase separated {(L(o)/L(d))} mixture while the other contains only unsaturated lipid, which on its own would be in the L(d) phase. In addition, we have run simulations where the lengths of the saturated lipid chains as well as the mole ratios of the three lipid components are varied. Collectively, we report on three types of interleaflet coupling within a bilayer. First, we show the effects of compositional asymmetry on acyl chain tilt and order, lipid rotational dynamics, and lateral diffusion in regions of leaflets that are opposite L(o) domains. Second, we show substantial effects of compositional asymmetry on local bilayer curvature, with the conclusion that phase separated leaflets resist curvature, while inducing large degrees of curvature in an opposing L(d) leaflet. Finally, in compositionally symmetric, phase separated bilayers, we find phase asymmetry (domain antiregistration) between the two leaflets occurs as a consequence of mismatched acyl chain-lengths in the saturated and unsaturated lipids.},

  abstract={Recently discovered bacterial homologues of eukaryotic pentameric ligand-gated ion channels, such as the Gloeobacter violaceus receptor {(GLIC),} are increasingly used as structural and functional models of signal transduction in the nervous system. Here we present a one-microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulation of the {GLIC} channel {pH} stimulated gating mechanism. The crystal structure of {GLIC} obtained at acidic {pH} in an open-channel form is equilibrated in a membrane environment and then instantly set to neutral {pH.} The simulation shows a channel closure that rapidly takes place at the level of the hydrophobic furrow and a progressively increasing quaternary twist. Two major events are captured during the simulation. They are initiated by local but large fluctuations in the pore, taking place at the top of the M2 helix, followed by a global tertiary relaxation. The two-step transition of the first subunit starts within the first 50 ns of the simulation and is followed at 450 ns by its immediate neighbor in the pentamer, which proceeds with a similar scenario. This observation suggests a possible two-step domino-like tertiary mechanism that takes place between adjacent subunits. In addition, the dynamical properties of {GLIC} described here offer an interpretation of the paradoxical properties of a permeable {A13'F} mutant whose crystal structure determined at 3.15 A shows a pore too narrow to conduct ions.},

Spectroscopic and chemical labeling data indicate that the receptor in phosphatidylcholine alone is stabilized in a desensitized-like state, whereas the presence of either cholesterol or phosphatidic acid favors a resting-like conformation. Membranes that effectively stabilize a resting-like state exhibit a relatively large proportion of non-hydrogen-bonded lipid ester carbonyls, suggesting a relatively tight packing of the lipid head groups and thus a well ordered membrane. Functional reconstituted membranes also exhibit gel-to-liquid crystal phase transition temperatures that are higher than those of nonfunctional reconstituted membranes composed of phosphatidylcholine alone. Significantly, incorporation of the receptor into phosphatidic acid-containing membranes leads to a dramatic increase in both the lateral packing densities and the gel-to-liquid crystal phase transition temperatures of the reconstituted lipid bilayers. These results suggest a functional link between the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and the physical properties of phosphatidic acid-containing membranes that could underlie the mechanism by which this lipid preferentially enhances receptor function.},

  abstract = {We have examined the effects of cholesterol on the thermotropic phase behavior and organization of aqueous dispersions of a homologous series of linear disaturated phosphatidylserines by high-sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. We find that the incorporation of increasing quantities of cholesterol progressively reduces the temperature, enthalpy, and cooperativity of the gel-to-liquid-crystalline phase transition of the host phosphatidylserine bilayer, such that a cooperative chain-melting phase transition is completely or almost completely abolished at 50 mol {\%} cholesterol, in contrast to the results of previous studies. We are also unable to detect the presence of a separate anhydrous cholesterol or cholesterol monohydrate phase in our binary mixtures, again in contrast to previous reports. We further show that the magnitude of the reduction in the phase transition temperature induced by cholesterol addition is independent of the hydrocarbon chain length of the phosphatidylserine studied. This result contrasts with our previous results with phosphatidylcholine bilayers, where we found that cholesterol increases or decreases the phase transition temperature in a chain length-dependent manner (1993. Biochemistry, 32:516-522), but is in agreement with our previous results for phosphatidylethanolamine bilayers, where no hydrocarbon chain length-dependent effects were observed (1999. Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1416.119-234). However, the reduction in the phase transition temperature by cholesterol is of greater magnitude in phosphatidylethanolamine as compared to phosphatidylserine bilayers. We also show that the addition of cholesterol facilitates the formation of the lamellar crystalline phase in phosphatidylserine bilayers, as it does in phosphatidylethanolamine bilayers, whereas the formation of such phases in phosphatidylcholine bilayers is inhibited by the presence of cholesterol. We ascribe the limited miscibility of cholesterol in phosphatidylserine bilayers reported previously to a fractional crystallization of the cholesterol and phospholipid phases during the removal of organic solvent from the binary mixture before the hydration of the sample. In general, the results of our studies to date indicate that the magnitude of the effect of cholesterol on the thermotropic phase behavior of the host phospholipid bilayer, and its miscibility in phospholipid dispersions generally, depend on the strength of the attractive interactions between the polar headgroups and the hydrocarbon chains of the phospholipid molecule, and not on the charge of the polar headgroups per se},

  abstract = {Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) are neurotransmitter-activated receptors that mediate fast synaptic transmission. In pLGICs, binding of agonist to the extracellular domain triggers a structural rearrangement that leads to the opening of an ion-conducting pore in the transmembrane domain and, in the continued presence of neurotransmitter, the channels desensitize (close). The flexible loops in each subunit that connect the extracellular binding domain (loops 2, 7, and 9) to the transmembrane channel domain (M2-M3 loop) are essential for coupling ligand binding to channel gating. Comparing the crystal structures of two bacterial pLGIC homologues, ELIC and the proton-activated GLIC, suggests channel gating is associated with rearrangements in these loops, but whether these motions accurately predict the motions in functional lipid-embedded pLGICs is unknown. Here, using site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and functional GLIC channels reconstituted into liposomes, we examined if, and how far, the loops at the ECD/TMD gating interface move during proton-dependent gating transitions from the resting to desensitized state. Loop 9 moves ∼9 {\AA} inward toward the channel lumen in response to proton-induced desensitization. Loop 9 motions were not observed when GLIC was in detergent micelles, suggesting detergent solubilization traps the protein in a nonactivatable state and lipids are required for functional gating transitions. Proton-induced desensitization immobilizes loop 2 with little change in position. Proton-induced motion of the M2-M3 loop was not observed, suggesting its conformation is nearly identical in closed and desensitized states. Our experimentally derived distance measurements of spin-labeled GLIC suggest ELIC is not a good model for the functional resting state of GLIC, and that the crystal structure of GLIC does not correspond to a desensitized state. These findings advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying pLGIC gating.},

  abstract = {The selectivity of lipid−protein interaction for spin-labeled phospholipids and gangliosides in nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-rich membranes from Torpedo marmorata has been studied by ESR spectroscopy. The association constants of the spin-labeled lipids (relative to phosphatidylcholine) at pH 8.0 are in the order cardiolipin (5.1) ≈ stearic acid (4.9) ≈ phosphatidylinositol (4.7) {\textgreater} phosphatidylserine (2.7) {\textgreater} phosphatidylglycerol (1.7) {\textgreater} GD1b ≈ GM1 ≈ GM2 ≈ GM3 ≈ phosphatidylcholine (1.0) {\textgreater} phosphatidylethanolamine (0.5). No selectivity for mono- or disialogangliosides is found over that for phosphatidylcholine. Aminated local anesthetics were found to compete with spin-labeled phosphatidylinositol, but to a much lesser extent with spin-labeled stearic acid, for sites on the intramembranous surface of the protein. The relative association constant of phosphatidylinositol was reduced in the presence of the different local anesthetics to the following extents: tetracaine (55{\%}) {\textgreater} procaine (35{\%}) ≈ benzocaine (30{\%}). For stearic acid, only tetracaine gave an appreciable reduction (30{\%}) in association constant. These displacements represent an intrinsic difference in affinity of the local anesthetics for the lipid−protein interface because the membrane partition coefficients are in the order benzocaine ≫ tetracaine ≈ procaine.},

  abstract={Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate fast chemical neurotransmission at the neuromuscular junction and have diverse signalling roles in the central nervous system. The nicotinic receptor has been a model system for cell-surface receptors, and specifically for ligand-gated ion channels, for well over a century. In addition to the receptors’ prominent roles in the development of the fields of pharmacology and neurobiology, nicotinic receptors are important therapeutic targets for neuromuscular disease, addiction, epilepsy and for neuromuscular blocking agents used during surgery. The overall architecture of the receptor was described in landmark studies of the nicotinic receptor isolated from the electric organ of Torpedo marmorata. Structures of a soluble ligand-binding domain have provided atomic-scale insights into receptor–ligand interactions, while high-resolution structures of other members of the pentameric receptor superfamily provide touchstones for an emerging allosteric gating mechanism. All available high-resolution structures are of homopentameric receptors. However, the vast majority of pentameric receptors (called Cys-loop receptors in eukaryotes) present physiologically are heteromeric. Here we present the X-ray crystallographic structure of the human α4β2 nicotinic receptor, the most abundant nicotinic subtype in the brain. This structure provides insights into the architectural principles governing ligand recognition, heteromer assembly, ion permeation and desensitization in this prototypical receptor class.},

Specifically, isoflurane binds persistently to three classes of sites in the {nAChR} transmembrane domain: (i) An isoflurane dimer occludes the pore, contacting residues identified by previous mutagenesis studies; analogous behavior is observed in {GLIC.} (ii) Several {nAChR} subunit interfaces are also occupied, in a site suggested by photoaffinity labeling and thought to positively modulate the receptor; these sites are not occupied in {GLIC.} (iii) Isoflurane binds to the subunit centers of both {nAChR} α chains and one of the {GLIC} chains, in a site that has had little experimental targeting. Interpreted in the context of existing structural and physiological data, the present {MD} results support a multisite model for the mechanism of receptor-channel modulation by anesthetics.},

  abstract={The intact Xenopus laevis oocyte is a useful model system for studying expressed water and solute transporters but suffers from a number of limitations, most notably large unstirred layers and other intracellular diffusion barriers. To overcome these, we have developed a method for isolating plasma membrane vesicles from oocytes. This approach facilitates more precise control of the intravesicular environment and virtually eliminates the problem of unstirred layers in kinetic experiments. The isolation procedure results in 50.6-fold enrichment of the plasma membrane marker alkaline phosphodiesterase compared with the homogenate. Markers of late endosomes/lysosomes and mitochondria were not enriched, and the endoplasmic reticulum was enriched only modestly. Permeabilities of native plasma membrane to water and urea were 8.1 x 10(-4) and 5.6 x 10(-7) cm/s, respectively, values that are sufficiently low to classify them as barrier membranes. Phospholipid analysis by mass spectrometry showed the membrane, not including cholesterol, to be rich in phosphatidylcholine (35.8 mole percent), sphingomyelin (25.8 mole percent), and phosphatidylinositol (6.8 mole percent). Cholesterol concentration was 20.7 mole percent. Membrane vesicles isolated from oocytes expressing aquaporin-1 exhibited fourfold higher water permeability in stopped-flow experiments. Oocytes expressing mouse urea transporter A3 {(UT-A3)} exhibited 7.5-fold faster phloretin-inhibitable urea transport compared with water-injected controls. There was no difference in water permeability between these membrane vesicles, suggesting that {UT-A3} is not a water carrier. In conclusion, we describe an improved method for the isolation of the oocyte plasma membrane that will allow the study of water and solute transport kinetics as well as substrate selectivity in heterologously expressed proteins.},
