%% Text of abstract
Reconstituted nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) exhibit significant gain-of-function upon addition of cholesterol to reconstitution mixtures, and cholesterol affects organization of nAChRs within domain-forming membranes, but whether \nachr~partitions to cholesterol-rich liquid-ordered (``raft``) domains or cholesterol-poor liquid-disordered domains is unknown.  
%The functional sensitivity of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) to membrane lipids is well-established, and it has been demonstrated numerous times that adding at least 10-15\% cholesterol can restore nAChR native function in model phosphatidylcholine model membranes.  Along with images of nAChR clustering, it has been hypothesized that nAChRs partition to cholesterol rich liquid-ordered (``raft'') domains within membranes, although this has not been directly observed.  
We use coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to observe spontaneous interactions of cholesterol, saturated lipids, and polyunsaturated lipids with \nachr s. 
% in binary cholesterol-containing model membranes as well as ternary domain-forming membranes inspired by native nAChR membranes, which include high levels of $n-3$ polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), saturated fatty acids, and cholesterol. 
In binary Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine:Cholesterol (DPPC:CHOL) mixtures, both CHOL and DPPC acyl chains were observed spontaneously entering deep ``non-annular'' cavities in the \nachr~TMD, particularly at the subunit interface and the $\beta$ subunit center, facilited by the low amino acid density in the cryo-EM structure of nAChR in a native membrane.  Cholesterol was highly enriched in the annulus around the TMD, but this was a short range effect that extended over (at most) 5-10\AA. 
%The two PUFAs chosen for these simulations were Docosahexaenoic acid and Linoleic acid.
In ternary mixtures containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), the presence of a single receptor did not significantly affect the likelihood of domain formation, and nAChR partitioned to the cholesterol-poor liquid-disordered domain whenever one was present. This was independent of whether the $\ldo$ domain lipids had PC or PE headgroups, but saturated lipids with PE headgroups were less depleted from the boundary than those with PC headgroups. % frequently near the boundary of the liquid-ordered domain. 
%Analysis of boundary lipid composition indicates enrichment of PUFA chains, particularly $n-3$ chains (tested here with Docosahexaenoic Acid, DHA), and to a lesser extent, $n-6$ chains (represented here with Linoleic acid,\graceforgrace{need to be consistent with lipid} LoA), regardless of whether the headgroup for the PUFA containing lipid is PC or PE, while Saturated lipids are moderately less likely to be depleted from the \nachr~boundary with a PE headgroup than a PC headgroup.  % a  confirms nAChR boundary lipids are enriched in PUFAs. 
%$\alpha$ subunits, however, indicate a preference for cholesterol rich domains, potentially facilitating partitioning near the interface. 
Enrichment of unsaturated phospholipids among boundary lipids was positively correlated with their propensity for demixing from cholesterol-rich phases. Long $n-3$ chains (tested here with Docosahexaenoic Acid, DHA) were highly enriched in annular and non-annular embedded sites, partially displacing cholesterol and completely displacing DPPC, and occupying sites even deeper within the bundle. Shorter $n-6$ chains (Linoleic acid, LA) were far less effective at displacing cholesterol from non-annular sites.   % , with PUFA acyl chains preferred over cholesterol in most sites.   %  while beta subunits show preference for PUFAs. Lastly, analysis shows PUFAs and cholesterol binding non-annularly nAChR.
