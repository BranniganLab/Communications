	cholesterol in vectorial vesicle permeability assays. Using a stopped-flow

	imposed by vesicle morphology, it was shown that polar conjugates
	of cholesterol could also satisfy the sterol requirement [Biochim.
	Biophys. Acta 1370 (1998) 299]. Here this assay is used to explore
	the chemical specificity of sterols. Affinity-purified nAcChoRs from

	[1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC)/1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate
	(DOPA)/steroid]. When the enantiomer of cholesterol was used, or
	when the stereochemistry at the 3-hydroxy group was changed from
	beta to alpha by substituting epicholesterol for cholesterol, activation
	was still supported. The importance of cholesterol's planar ring
	structure was tested by comparing planar cholestanol (5alpha-cholestan-3beta-ol)
	with nonplanar coprostanol (5beta-cholestan-3beta-ol). Both supported
	activation. Thus, these steroids support activation independent of
	structural features known to be important for modulation of lipid
	bilayer properties. This provides indirect support for a steroid

	comes from several sources including electron microscopic studies

	In 2011 our group published structures of the Caenorhabditis elegans
	glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl) in complex with the allosteric
	partial agonist ivermectin, which provided insights into the structure
	of a possibly open state of a eukaryotic Cys-loop receptor, the basis

	ivermectin and related molecules stabilize the open state and potentiate
	neurotransmitter binding. However, there remain unanswered questions

	the closed/resting, open/activated and closed/desensitized states,

	the extracellular, orthosteric agonist binding domain and the transmembrane,
	ion channel domain. Here we present two conformationally distinct
	structures of C. elegans GluCl in the absence of ivermectin. Structural
	comparisons reveal a quaternary activation mechanism arising from
	rigid-body movements between the extracellular and transmembrane
	domains and a mechanism for modulation of the receptor by phospholipids.},

  abstract = {Membrane lipids are potent modulators of the nicotinic acetylcholine
	receptor (nAChR) from Torpedo. Lipids influence nAChR function by
	both conformational selection and kinetic mechanisms, stabilizing
	varying proportions of activatable versus non-activatable conformations,
	as well as influencing the transitions between these conformational
	States. Of note, some membranes stabilize an electrically silent
	uncoupled conformation that binds agonist but does not undergo agonist-induced
	conformational transitions. The uncoupled nAChR, however, does transition
	to activatable conformations in relatively thick lipid bilayers,

	available high resolution structural and functional data. These data
	highlight different sites of lipid action, including the lipid-exposed
	M4 transmembrane $\alpha$-helix. Current evidence suggests that lipids
	alter nAChR function by modulating interactions between M4 and the
	adjacent transmembrane $\alpha$-helices, M1 and M3. These interactions
	have also been implicated in both the folding and trafficking of
	nAChRs to the cell surface. We review current mechanistic understanding

  abstract = {Calcium-permeable neurotransmitter receptors are concentrated into
	structurally and biochemically isolated cellular compartments to
	localize calcium-mediated events during neurotransmission. The cytoplasmic
	membrane contains lipid microdomains called lipid rafts, which can
	gather into microscopically visible clusters, and thus the association
	of a particular protein with lipid rafts can result in its redistribution
	on the cell surface. The present study asks whether lipid rafts participate
	in the formation and maintenance of the calcium-permeable alpha7-subunit
	nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7nAChR) clusters found in
	somatic spines of ciliary neurons. Lipid rafts and alpha7nAChR become
	progressively colocalized within somatic spines during synaptogenesis.
	To determine whether these rafts are required for the maintenance
	of alpha7nAChR aggregates, cholesterol was extracted from dissociated
	ciliary neurons by treatment with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin. This
	treatment caused the dispersion of lipid rafts and the redistribution
	of alpha7nAChR into small clusters over the cell surface, suggesting
	that the integrity of lipid rafts is required to maintain the receptor
	clustering. However, lipid raft dispersion also caused the depolymerization
	of the F-actin cytoskeleton, which can also tether the receptor at
	specific sites. To assess whether interaction between rafts and alpha7nAChR
	is independent of F-actin filaments, the lipid raft patches were
	stabilized with a combination of the cholera toxin B subunit (CTX),
	which specifically binds to the raft component ganglioside GM1, and
	an antibody against CTX. The stabilized rafts were then treated with
	latrunculin-A to depolymerize F-actin. Under these conditions, large
	patches of CTX persisted and were colocalized with alpha7nAChR, indicating
	that the aggregates of receptors can be maintained independently
	of the underlying F-actin cytoskeleton. Moreover, it was found that
	the alpha7nAChR is resistant to detergent extraction at 4 degrees
	C and floats with the caveolin-containing lipid-rich fraction during
	density gradient centrifugation, properties that are consistent with
	a direct association between the receptor and the membrane microdomains.},

	model to study this phenomenon is the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
	(nAChR), since the nAChR activatable pool has been estimated to be

	Studies on the effect of cholesterol depletion in the function of
	the Torpedo californica nAChR, using the lipid-exposed nAChR mutation
	(alphaC418W) that produces a congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS),
	demonstrated that cholesterol depletion causes a remarkable increase
	in the alphaC418W nAChR?s macroscopic current whereas not in the
	wild-type (WT). A variety of approaches were used to define the mechanism
	responsible for the cholesterol depletion mediated-increase in the
	alphaC418W nAChR?s macroscopic current. The present study suggests
	that a substantial fraction of the alphaC418W nAChRs is located in
	caveolin-1-positive domains, ?trapped? in a non-activatable state,
	and that membrane cholesterol depletion results in the relocation
	of these receptors to the activatable pool. Co-fractionation and
	co-immunoprecipitation of the alphaC418W nAChR and the membrane raft
	protein caveolin-1 (cav1) support the notion that interactions at
	lipid-exposed domains regulate the partition of the receptor into

	receptors, are the targets for many general anesthetics, including
	volatile anesthetics, etomidate, propofol, and barbiturates. How
	such structurally diverse agents can act similarly as positive allosteric
	modulators of GABAARs remains unclear. Previously, photoreactive
	etomidate analogs identified two equivalent anesthetic-binding sites
	in the transmembrane domain at the β(+)-α(-) subunit interfaces,
	which also contain the GABA-binding sites in the extracellular domain.
	Here, we used R-[(3)H]5-allyl-1-methyl-5-(m-trifluoromethyl-diazirynylphenyl)
	barbituric acid (R-mTFD-MPAB), a potent stereospecific barbiturate
	anesthetic, to photolabel expressed human α1β3γ2 GABAARs. Protein
	microsequencing revealed that R-[(3)H]mTFD-MPAB did not photolabel
	the etomidate sites at the β(+)-α(-) subunit interfaces. Instead,
	it photolabeled sites at the α(+)-β(-) and γ(+)-β(-) subunit interfaces
	in the transmembrane domain. On the (+)-side, α1M3 was labeled at
	Ala-291 and Tyr-294 and γ2M3 at Ser-301, and on the (-)-side, β3M1
	was labeled at Met-227. These residues, like those in the etomidate
	site, are located at subunit interfaces near the synaptic side of
	the transmembrane domain. The selectivity of R-etomidate for the
	β(+)-α(-) interface relative to the α(+)-β(-)/γ(+)-β(-) interfaces
	was >100-fold, whereas that of R-mTFD-MPAB for its sites was >50-fold.
	Each ligand could enhance photoincorporation of the other, demonstrating
	allosteric interactions between the sites. The structural heterogeneity

  abstract = {The squid has been the most studied cephalopod, and it has served
	as a very useful model for investigating the events associated with
	nerve impulse generation and synaptic transmission. While the physiology
	of squid giant axons has been extensively studied, very little is
	known about the distribution and function of the neurotransmitters
	and receptors that mediate inhibitory transmission at the synapses.
	In this study we investigated whether $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid
	(GABA) activates neurotransmitter receptors in stellate ganglia membranes.
	To overcome the low abundance of GABA-like mRNAs in invertebrates
	and the low expression of GABA in cephalopods, we used a two-electrode
	voltage clamp technique to determine if Xenopus laevis oocytes injected
	with cell membranes from squid stellate ganglia responded to GABA.
	Using this method, membrane patches containing proteins and ion channels
	from the squid's stellate ganglion were incorporated into the surface
	of oocytes. We demonstrated that GABA activates membrane receptors
	in cellular membranes isolated from squid stellate ganglia. Using
	the same approach, we were able to record native glutamate-evoked
	currents. The squid's GABA receptors showed an EC(50) of 98 $\mu$mol
	l(-1) to GABA and were inhibited by zinc (IC(50) = 356 $\mu$mol l(-1)).
	Interestingly, GABA receptors from the squid were only partially
	blocked by bicuculline. These results indicate that the microtransplantation
	of native cell membranes is useful to identify and characterize scarce
	membrane proteins. Moreover, our data also support the role of GABA
	as an ionotropic neurotransmitter in cephalopods, acting through
	chloride-permeable membrane receptors.},

  abstract = {The X-ray structure of a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel from
	Erwinia chrysanthemi (ELIC) has recently provided structural insight
	into this family of ion channels at high resolution. The structure
	shows a homo-pentameric protein with a barrel-stave architecture
	that defines an ion-conduction pore located on the fivefold axis
	of symmetry. In this structure, the wide aqueous vestibule that is
	encircled by the extracellular ligand-binding domains of the five
	subunits narrows to a discontinuous pore that spans the lipid bilayer.
	The pore is constricted by bulky hydrophobic residues towards the
	extracellular side, which probably serve as barriers that prevent
	the diffusion of ions. This interrupted pore architecture in ELIC
	thus depicts a non-conducting conformation of a pentameric ligand-gated
	ion channel, the thermodynamically stable state in the absence of
	bound ligand. As ligand binding promotes pore opening in these ion
	channels and the specific ligand for ELIC has not yet been identified,
	we have turned our attention towards a homologous protein from the
	cyanobacterium Gloebacter violaceus (GLIC). GLIC was shown to form
	proton-gated channels that are activated by a pH decrease on the
	extracellular side and that do not desensitize after activation.
	Both prokaryotic proteins, ELIC and GLIC form ion channels that are
	selective for cations over anions with poor discrimination among
	monovalent cations, characteristics that resemble the conduction
	properties of the cation-selective branch of the family that includes
	acetylcholine and serotonin receptors. Here we present the X-ray
	structure of GLIC at 3.1 A resolution. The structure reveals a conformation
	of the channel that is distinct from ELIC and that probably resembles
	the open state. In combination, both structures suggest a novel gating
	mechanism for pentameric ligand-gated ion channels where channel
	opening proceeds by a change in the tilt of the pore-forming helices.},

	facilitates more precise control of the intravesicular environment
	and virtually eliminates the problem of unstirred layers in kinetic
	experiments. The isolation procedure results in 50.6-fold enrichment
	of the plasma membrane marker alkaline phosphodiesterase compared
	with the homogenate. Markers of late endosomes/lysosomes and mitochondria
	were not enriched, and the endoplasmic reticulum was enriched only
	modestly. Permeabilities of native plasma membrane to water and urea
	were 8.1 x 10(-4) and 5.6 x 10(-7) cm/s, respectively, values that
	are sufficiently low to classify them as barrier membranes. Phospholipid
	analysis by mass spectrometry showed the membrane, not including
	cholesterol, to be rich in phosphatidylcholine (35.8 mole percent),
	sphingomyelin (25.8 mole percent), and phosphatidylinositol (6.8
	mole percent). Cholesterol concentration was 20.7 mole percent. Membrane
	vesicles isolated from oocytes expressing aquaporin-1 exhibited fourfold
	higher water permeability in stopped-flow experiments. Oocytes expressing
	mouse urea transporter A3 (UT-A3) exhibited 7.5-fold faster phloretin-inhibitable
	urea transport compared with water-injected controls. There was no
	difference in water permeability between these membrane vesicles,
	suggesting that UT-A3 is not a water carrier. In conclusion, we describe
	an improved method for the isolation of the oocyte plasma membrane

  abstract = {Inhibitory neurotransmission mediated by GABA(A) receptors can be
	modulated by the endogenous neurosteroids, allopregnanolone and tetrahydro-deoxycorticosterone.
	Neurosteroids are synthesized de novo in the brain during stress,
	pregnancyand after ethanol consumption, and disrupted steroid regulation
	of GABAergic transmission is strongly implicated in several debilitating
	conditions such as panic disorder, major depression, schizophrenia,
	alcohol dependence and catamenial epilepsy. Determining how neurosteroids
	interact with the GABA(A) receptor is a prerequisite for understanding
	their physiological and pathophysiological roles in the brain. Here
	we identify two discrete binding sites in the receptor's transmembrane
	domains that mediate the potentiating and direct activation effects
	of neurosteroids. They potentiate GABA responses from a cavity formed
	by the alpha-subunit transmembrane domains, whereas direct receptor
	activation is initiated by interfacial residues between alpha and
	beta subunits and is enhanced by steroid binding to the potentiation
	site. Thus, significant receptor activation by neurosteroids relies
	on occupancy of both the activation and potentiation sites. These
	sites are highly conserved throughout the GABA(A )receptor family,
	and their identification provides a unique opportunity for the development
	of new therapeutic, neurosteroid-based ligands and transgenic disease
	models of neurosteroid dysfunction.},

	set of pLGIC genes in unicellular eukaryotes, some of which are metazoan-like
	Cys-loop receptors, and others devoid of Cys-loop cysteines, like
	their prokaryotic relatives. A number of such "Cys-less" receptors
	also appears in invertebrate metazoans. Together, those findings
	draw a new distribution of pLGICs in eukaryotes. A broader distribution
	of prokaryotic channels also emerges, including a major new archaeal
	taxon, Thaumarchaeota. More generally, pLGICs now appear nearly ubiquitous
	in major taxonomic groups except multicellular plants and fungi.
	However, pLGICs are sparsely present in unicellular taxa, suggesting
	a high rate of gene loss and a non-essential character, contrasting
	with their essential role as synaptic receptors of the bilaterian
	nervous system. Multiple alignments of these highly divergent sequences
	reveal a small number of conserved residues clustered at the interface
	between the extracellular and transmembrane domains. Only the "Cys-loop"
	proline is absolutely conserved, suggesting the more fitting name
	"Pro loop" for that motif, and "Pro-loop receptors" for the superfamily.
	The infered molecular phylogeny shows a Cys-loop and a Cys-less clade
	in eukaryotes, both containing metazoans and unicellular members.
	This suggests new hypotheses on the evolutionary history of the superfamily,
	such as a possible origin of the Cys-loop cysteines in an ancient
	unicellular eukaryote. Deeper phylogenetic relationships remain uncertain,

	that can be accompanied by heavy smoking. Recently, genome-wide association
	studies (GWAS) identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)

	the risks for both smoking and schizophrenia. Mice with altered nAChR

	that these structurally distinct general anesthetics bind to sites
	in GABA(A)Rs in the transmembrane domain at the interface between
	the beta and alpha subunits. We tested whether the two ligand binding
	sites might overlap by examining whether neuroactive steroids inhibited
	etomidate analog photolabeling. We previously identified (Li, G.

	of GABA(A)R alpha1Met-236 and betaMet-286 (in alphaM1 and betaM3).
	Positioning these two photolabeled amino acids in a single type of
	binding site at the interface of beta and alpha subunits (two copies
	per pentamer) is consistent with a GABA(A)R homology model based
	upon the structure of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and with

	neurosteroids enhance rather than inhibit azietomidate photolabeling,

	neurosteroids do not inhibit photolabeling of GABA(A)R alpha1Met-236
	or betaMet-286 but enhance labeling of alpha1Met-236. Thus modulatory
	steroids do not bind at the same site as etomidate, and neither of

	(AChR) clustering at the neuromuscular junction. In a previous study,
	we demonstrated that rapsyn is specifically cotransported with AChR
	via post-Golgi vesicles targeted to the innervated surface of the
	Torpedo electrocyte (Marchand et al., 2000). In the present study,
	to further elucidate the mechanisms for sorting and assembly of postsynaptic
	proteins, we analyzed the dynamics of the intracellular trafficking
	of fluorescently labeled rapsyn in the transient-expressing COS-7
	cell system. Our approach was based on fluorescence, time-lapse imaging,
	and immunoelectron microscopies, as well as biochemical analyses.
	We report that newly synthesized rapsyn associates with the trans-Golgi
	network compartment and traffics via vesiculotubular organelles toward
	the cell surface of COS-7 cells. The targeting of rapsyn organelles
	appeared to be mediated by a microtubule-dependent transport. Using
	cotransfection experiments of rapsyn and AChR, we observed that these
	two molecules codistribute within distal exocytic routes and at the
	plasma membrane. Triton X-100 extraction on ice and flotation gradient
	centrifugation demonstrated that rapsyn and AChR are recovered in
	low-density fractions enriched in two rafts markers: caveolin-1 and
	flotillin-1. We propose that sorting and targeting of these two companion
	molecules are mediated by association with cholesterol-sphingolipid-enriched
	raft microdomains. Collectively, these data highlight rapsyn as an
	itinerant vesicular protein that may play a dynamic role in the sorting
	and targeting of its companion receptor to the postsynaptic membrane.
	These data also raise the interesting hypothesis of the participation
	of the raft machinery in the targeting of signaling molecules to
	synaptic sites.},

	pore is shaped by an inner ring of 5 alpha-helices, which curve radially
	to create a tapering path for the ions, and an outer ring of 15 alpha-helices,
	which coil around each other and shield the inner ring from the lipids.
	The gate is a constricting hydrophobic girdle at the middle of the
	lipid bilayer, formed by weak interactions between neighbouring inner
	helices. When acetylcholine enters the ligand-binding domain, it
	triggers rotations of the protein chains on opposite sides of the
	entrance to the pore. These rotations are communicated through the
	inner helices, and open the pore by breaking the girdle apart.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that specific amino acid residues
	in the putative second transmembrane segment (TM2) of the gamma-aminobutyric
	acid receptor type A (GABAA) receptor play a critical role in the
	enhancement of GABAA receptor function by halothane, enflurane, and
	isoflurane. However, very little is known about the actions of sevoflurane
	and desflurane on recombinant GABAA receptors. The aim of this study
	was to examine the effects of sevoflurane and desflurane on potentiation
	of GABA-induced responses in the wild-type GABAA receptor and in
	receptors mutated in TM2 of the alpha1, alpha 2, or beta 2 subunits.
	METHODS: GABAA receptor alpha 1 or alpha 2, beta 2 or beta 3, and
	gamma 2s subunit cDNAs were expressed for pharmacologic study by
	transfection of human embryonic kidney 293 cells and assayed using
	the whole cell voltage clamp technique. Concentration-response curves
	and EC50 values for agonist were determined in the wild-type alpha
	1 beta 2 gamma 2s and alpha 2 beta 3 gamma 2s receptors, and in receptors
	harboring mutations in TM2, such as alpha1(S270W)beta 2 gamma 2s,
	alpha 1 beta 2(N265W)gamma 2s, and alpha2(S270I)beta 3 gamma 2s.
	The actions of clinically relevant concentration of volatile anesthetics
	(isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane) on GABA activated Cl- currents
	were compared in the wild-type and mutant GABAA receptors. RESULTS:
	Both sevoflurane and desflurane potentiated submaximal GABA currents
	in the wild-type GABAA alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2s receptor and alpha
	2 beta 3 gamma 2s receptor. Substitution of Ser270 in TM2 of the
	alpha subunit by a larger amino acid, tryptophan (W) or isoleucine
	(I), as in alpha1(S270W)beta 2 gamma 2s and alpha 2(S270I)beta 3
	gamma 2s, completely abolished the potentiation of GABA-induced currents
	by these anesthetic agents. In contrast, mutation of Asn265 in TM2
	of the beta subunit to tryptophan (W) did not prevent potentiation
	of GABA-induced responses. The actions of sevoflurane and desflurane
	in the wild-type receptor and in mutated receptors were qualitatively
	and quantitatively similar to those observed for isoflurane. CONCLUSIONS:
	Positions Ser270 of the GABAA alpha1 and alpha2 subunits, but not
	Asn265 in the TM2 of the beta2 subunit, are critical for regulation
	of the GABAA receptor by sevoflurane and desflurane, as well as isoflurane,
	consistent with the idea that these three volatile anesthetics share
	a common site of actions on the alpha subunit of the GABAA receptor.},

	virus A. Lipid rafts are thought to be small, fluctuating patches

	and certain types of protein. However, raft-associating transmembrane
	(TM) proteins generally partition into Ld domains in model membranes,
	which are enriched in unsaturated lipids and depleted in saturated
	lipids and cholesterol. The reason for this apparent disparity in
	behavior is unclear, but model membranes differ from the plasma membrane

	in the plasma membrane may influence the partitioning of membrane
	proteins for rafts. To investigate the effect of high local protein
	concentration, we have conducted coarse-grained molecular dynamics
	(CG MD) simulations of HA clusters in domain-forming bilayers. During
	the simulations, we observed a continuous increase in the proportion
	of raft-type lipids (saturated phospholipids and cholesterol) within
	the area of membrane spanned by the protein cluster. Lateral diffusion
	of unsaturated lipids was significantly attenuated within the cluster,
	while saturated lipids were relatively unaffected. On this basis,
	we suggest a possible explanation for the change in lipid distribution,
	namely that steric crowding by the slow-diffusing proteins increases
	the chemical potential for unsaturated lipids within the cluster
	region. We therefore suggest that a local aggregation of HA can be
	sufficient to drive association of the protein with raft-type lipids.
	This may also represent a general mechanism for the targeting of
	TM proteins to rafts in the plasma membrane, which is of functional
	importance in a wide range of cellular processes.},

	The large computational effort associated with such modelling with

	approach based on a coarse-grained representation of the conformational
	space of the spin label. We show here that libraries of about 200
	rotamers, obtained by iterative projection of a long MD trajectory
	of the free spin label onto a set of canonical dihedral angles, provide
	a representation of the underlying trajectory adequate for EPR distance
	measurements. Rotamer analysis was performed on selected X-ray structures
	of spin labelled T4 lysozyme mutants to characterize the spin label
	rotamer ensemble on a single protein site. Furthermore, predictions
	based on the rotamer library approach are shown to be in nearly quantitative
	agreement with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) distance data
	on the Na(+)/H(+) antiporter NhaA and on the light-harvesting complex
	LHCII whose structures are known from independent cryo electron microscopy

	of rapsyn is conferred solely by its acylated N terminus, as the
	myristoylated N-terminal 15 amino acids of rapsyn are sufficient
	to target green fluorescent protein to the plasma membrane. However,
	neither N-terminal myristoylation nor the conserved N-terminal amino
	acid sequence is essential. Membrane targeting, self-association,
	and nAChR clustering are preserved when the first 10 amino acids
	of rapsyn were replaced by those of src, which also contains a consensus
	sequence for N-myristoylation, or by those of GAP43, which contains
	a palmitoylation sequence. Rapsyn1-90, containing two tetratrichopeptide
	repeats is sufficient for self-association. Rapsyn1-360, lacking
	the cysteine rich domain, clusters nAChRs, while rapsyn1-287, containing
	seven tetratrichopeptide repeats, does not cluster nAChRs. We identified
	rapsyn298-331 as a potential coiled-coil domain, and established
	that mutations disrupting coiled-coil propensity prevent nAChR clustering.
	Thus the structural domains of rapsyn necessary for membrane targeting,
	self-association, and nAChR clustering are distinct, with nAChR-rapsyn
	interaction mediated by a previously unrecognized coiled-coil motif.},

  abstract = {When nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are reconstituted into lipid
	bilayers lacking cholesterol, agonists no longer stimulate cation
	flux. The kinetics of this process are difficult to study because
	variations in vesicle morphology cause errors in flux measurements.
	We developed a new stopped-flow fluorescence assay to study activation
	independently of vesicle morphology. When receptors were rapidly
	mixed with agonist plus ethidium, the earliest fluorescence increase
	reported the fraction of channels that opened and their apparent
	rate of fast desensitization. These processes were absent when the
	receptor was reconstituted into dioleoylphosphatidylcholine or into
	a mixture of that lipid with dioleoylphosphatidic acid (12 mol%),
	even though a fluorescent agonist reported that resting-state receptors
	were still present. The agonist-induced channel opening probability
	increased with bilayer cholesterol, with a midpoint value of 9 +/-
	1.7 mol% and a Hill coefficient of 1.9 +/- 0.69, reaching a plateau
	above 20-30 mol% cholesterol that was equal to the native value.
	On the other hand, the observed fast desensitization rate was comparable
	to that for native membranes from the lowest cholesterol concentration
	examined (5 mol%). Thus the ability to reach the open state after
	activation varies with the cholesterol concentration in the bilayer,
	whereas the rate of the open state to fast desensitized state transition
	is unaffected. The structural basis for this is unknown, but an interesting
	corollary is that the channels of newly synthesized receptors are
	not fully primed by cholesterol until they are inserted into the
	plasma membrane--a novel form of posttranslational processing.},

	molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of fully solvated T4 Lysozyme,
	labeled with the spin label MTSSL at positions 72 and 131. These
	two sites have been the object of numerous experimental studies and

	are constructed from the trajectories. The calculated multifrequency
	ESR spectra are in very good agreement with experiment for three
	different magnetic field strengths without adjusting any parameters.
	During the trajectories, the spin labels interconvert among a fairly

  number = {10},
  abstract = {Etomidate and propofol are potent general anesthetics that act via
	GABAA receptor allosteric co-agonist sites located at transmembrane
	$\beta$+/$\alpha$- inter-subunit interfaces. Early experiments in
	heteromeric receptors identified $\beta$N265 (M2-15') on $\beta$2
	and $\beta$3 subunits as an important determinant of sensitivity
	to these drugs. Mechanistic analyses suggest that substitution with
	serine, the $\beta$1 residue at this position, primarily reduces
	etomidate efficacy, while mutation to methionine eliminates etomidate
	sensitivity and might prevent drug binding. However, the $\beta$N265
	residue has not been photolabeled with analogs of either etomidate
	or propofol. Furthermore, substituted cysteine modification studies
	find no propofol protection at this locus, while etomidate protection
	has not been tested. Thus, evidence of contact between $\beta$N265
	and potent anesthetics is lacking and it remains uncertain how mutations
	alter drug sensitivity. In the current study, we first applied heterologous
	$\alpha$1$\beta$2N265C$\gamma$2L receptor expression in Xenopus oocytes,
	thiol-specific aqueous probe modification, and voltage-clamp electrophysiology
	to test whether etomidate inhibits probe reactions at the $\beta$-265
	sidechain. Using up to 300 µM etomidate, we found both an absence
	of etomidate effects on $\alpha$1$\beta$2N265C$\gamma$2L receptor
	activity and no inhibition of thiol modification. To gain further
	insight into anesthetic insensitive $\beta$N265M mutants, we applied
	indirect structure-function strategies, exploiting second mutations
	in $\alpha$1$\beta$2/3$\gamma$2L GABAA receptors. Using $\alpha$1M236C
	as a modifiable and anesthetic-protectable site occupancy reporter
	in $\beta$+/$\alpha$- interfaces, we found that $\beta$N265M reduced
	apparent anesthetic affinity for receptors in both resting and GABA-activated
	states. $\beta$N265M also impaired the transduction of gating effects
	associated with $\alpha$1M236W, a mutation that mimics $\beta$+/$\alpha$-
	anesthetic site occupancy. Our results show that $\beta$N265M mutations
	dramatically reduce the efficacy/transduction of anesthetics bound
	in $\beta$+/$\alpha$- sites, and also significantly reduce anesthetic
	affinity for resting state receptors. These findings are consistent
	with a role for $\beta$N265 in anesthetic binding within the $\beta$+/$\alpha$-
	transmembrane sites.},

	and the effects of these mutations were investigated using two-electrode
	voltage-clamp recording. 2. Four mutations (V257W, T262W, T265W and
	S270W) produced receptors which were active in the absence of agonist,
	and this spontaneous open channel activity was blocked by both picrotoxin
	and bicuculline, except in the alpha(2)(V257W)beta(2) mutant receptor,
	which was not sensitive to picrotoxin. 3. Six mutations (V257W, V260W,
	T262W, T267W, S270W and A273W) enhanced the agonist sensitivity of
	the receptor, by 10 - 100 times compared with the wild-type alpha(2)beta(2)
	receptor. Other mutations (T261W, V263W, L269W, I271W and S272W)
	had little or no effect on the apparent affinity of the receptor
	to GABA. Eight of the tryptophan mutations (R255, T256, F258, G259,

	4. The S270W mutation eliminated potentiation of GABA by ethanol,

	mutation produced direct activation (10{\%} of maximal GABA response)
	by ethanol in the absence of GABA, while other mutations did not
	alter the action of ethanol significantly. 5. These results are consistent
	with a unique role for S270 in the action of ethanol within the TM2
	region, and with models of GABA(A) receptor channel function, in
	which specific residues within TM2 are critical for the regulation
	of channel gating (S270, L264), while other residues (L269, I271

	Membrane lipids also play a vital but poorly understood role in this
	process of synaptic transmission. The present study examines the
	lipid distribution around nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors
	in tubular vesicles made from postsynaptic membranes of the Torpedo
	ray, taking advantage of the recent advances in cryo-EM. A segregated

	receptors. The particular lipid distribution can be interpreted straightforwardly
	in relation to the gating movements revealed by an earlier time-resolved
	cryo-EM study, in which the membranes were exposed briefly to ACh.
	The results suggest that in addition to stabilizing the protein,
	cholesterol may play a mechanical role by conferring local rigidity

	The agreement between experimental and calculated phases along the

	that the two ligand-binding alpha subunits have a different extended
	conformation from the three other subunits in the closed channel,

	of the alpha subunits are far apart in the closed channel, indicating
	that a localised rearrangement, involving closure of loops B and
	C around the bound ACh molecule, occurs upon activation. A comparison
	of the structure of the alpha subunit with that of AChBP having ligand
	present, suggests how the localised rearrangement overcomes the distortions
	and initiates the rotational movements associated with opening of
	the channel. Both vestibules of the channel are strongly electronegative,
	providing a cation-stabilising environment at either entrance of

In the present study we enhanced the functional characterization of nAChR-DCs by recording macroscopic ion channel currents in Xenopus oocytes using the two electrode voltage clamp (TEVC). The use of TEVC allows for the recording of macroscopic currents elicited by agonist activation of nAChR-DCs that assemble in the oocyte plasma membrane. Furthermore, we examined the stability of nAChR-DCs, which is obligatory for the nAChR crystallization, using a 30 day FRAP assay in LCP for each detergent. The present results indicate a marked difference in the fractional fluorescence recovery (ΔFFR) within the same detergent family during the 30 day period assayed. Within the cholesterol analog family, sodium cholate and CHAPSO displayed a minimum ΔFFR and a mobile fraction (MF) over 80%. In contrast, CHAPS and BigCHAP showed a marked decay in both the mobile fraction and diffusion coefficient. nAChR-DCs containing phospholipid analog detergents with an alkylphosphocholine (FC) and lysofoscholine (LFC) of 16 carbon chains (FC-16, LFC-16) were more effective in maintaining a mobile fraction of over 80% compared to their counterparts with shorter acyl chain (C12, C14). The significant differences in macroscopic current amplitudes, activation and desensitization rates among the different nAChR-DCs evaluated in the present study allow to dissect which detergent preserves both, agonist activation and ion channel function. Functionality assays using TEVC demonstrated that LFC16, LFC14, and cholate were the most effective detergents in preserving macroscopic ion channel function, however, the nAChR-cholate complex display a significant delay in the ACh-induce channel activation. In summary, these results suggest that the physical properties of the lipid analog detergents (headgroup and acyl chain length) are the most effective in maintaining both the stability and functionality of the nAChR in the detergent solubilized complex.},

Here, we review current understanding of the mechanisms underlying cholesterol-nAChR interactions in the context of increasingly available high-resolution structural and functional data. Cholesterol and other lipids influence function by conformational selection and kinetic mechanisms, stabilizing varying proportions of activatable vs nonactivatable conformations, as well as influencing the rates of transitions between conformational states. In the absence of cholesterol and anionic lipids, the nAChR adopts an uncoupled conformation that binds agonist but does not undergo agonist-induced conformational transitions-unless the nAChR is located in a relatively thick lipid bilayer, such as that found in cholesterol-rich lipid rafts. We highlight different sites of cholesterol action, including the lipid-exposed M4 transmembrane α-helix. Cholesterol and other lipids likely alter function by modulating interactions between M4 and the adjacent transmembrane α-helices, M1 and M3. These same interactions have been implicated in both the folding and trafficking of nAChRs to the cell surface. We evaluate the nature of cholesterol-nAChR interactions, considering the evidence supporting the roles of both direct binding to allosteric sites and cholesterol-induced changes in bulk membrane physical properties.},

  abstract        = {The lipid requirements of the Torpedo californica nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) were assessed by reconstituting purified receptors into lipid vesicles of defined composition and by using photolabeling with 3-trifluoromethyl-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine ([125I]TID) to determine functionality. Earlier studies demonstrated that nAChRs reconstituted into membranes containing phosphatidylcholine (PC), the anionic lipid phosphatidic acid (PA), and cholesterol (CH) are particularly effective at stabilizing the nAChR in the resting (closed) state that is capable of undergoing agonist-induced conformational transitions (i.e., functionality). The present studies demonstrate that (1) there is no obligatory requirement for PC, (2) increasing the CH content serves to increase the degree to which nAChRs are stabilized in the resting state, and this effect saturates at approximately 35 mol % (molar lipid percentage), and (3) the effect of increasing levels of PA saturates at approximately 12 mol % and in the absence of PA nAChRs are stabilized in the desensitized state (i.e., nonfunctional). Native Torpedo membranes contain approximately 35 mol % CH but less than 1 mol % PA, suggesting that other anionic lipids may substitute for PA. We report that (1) phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol (PI), anionic lipids that are abundant in native Torpedo membranes, also stabilize the receptor in the resting state although with reduced efficacy (approximately 50-60%) compared to PA, and (2) for nAChRs reconstituted into PA/CH membranes at different lipid-protein molar ratios, receptor functionality decreases rapidly below approximately 65 lipids per receptor. Collectively, these results are consistent with a functional requirement of a single shell of lipids surrounding the nAChR and specific anionic lipid- and sterol (CH)-protein interactions.},

  abstract        = {Neurotransmitter receptors, the macromolecules specialized in decoding the chemical signals encrypted in the chemical signaling mechanism in the nervous system, occur either at the somatic cell surface of chemically excitable cells or at specialized subcellular structures, the synapses. Synapses have lipid compositions distinct from the rest of the cell membrane, suggesting that neurotransmitter receptors and their scaffolding and adaptor protein partners require specific lipid habitats for optimal operation. In this review we discuss some paradigmatic cases of neurotransmitter receptor-lipid interactions, highlighting the chemical nature of the intervening lipid species and providing examples of the receptor mechanisms affected by interaction with lipids. The focus is on the effects of cholesterol, glycerophospholipids and covalent fatty acid acylation on neurotransmitter receptors. We also briefly discuss the role of lipid phase states involving lateral heterogeneities of the host membrane known to modulate membrane transport, protein sorting and signaling. Modulation of neurotransmitter receptors by lipids occurs at multiple levels, affecting a wide span of activities including their trafficking, sorting, stability, residence lifetime at the cell surface, endocytosis, and recycling, among other important functional properties at the synapse.},

The GABA  receptor is also a prolific target for therapeutic, illicit and recreational drugs, including benzodiazepines, barbiturates, anaesthetics and ethanol. Here we present high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures of the human α1β2γ2 GABA  receptor, the predominant isoform in the adult brain, in complex with GABA and the benzodiazepine site antagonist flumazenil, the first-line clinical treatment for benzodiazepine overdose. The receptor architecture reveals unique heteromeric interactions for this important class of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor. This work provides a template for understanding receptor modulation by GABA and benzodiazepines, and will assist rational approaches to therapeutic targeting of this receptor for neurological disorders and mental illness.},

However, it is essential to understand the limitations as well as the advantages of this method. DRMs do not correspond precisely to rafts in living cells. For this reason, finding a protein enriched in DRMs does not prove that it was in rafts in the living cell. Furthermore, the fraction of a protein found in DRMs provides no quantitative information about the fraction of the protein originally in rafts. In fact, DRMs may be isolated from membranes that did not even contain rafts before detergent extraction. DRM-association is useful because it reflects a high-inherent affinity of a protein for the ordered membrane state found in rafts. Treatments that affect the DRM-association of a protein can thus be inferred to affect its raft affinity. Current models suggest that rafts may form in a regulated manner, often associated with clustering of membrane proteins or lipids, during processes such as signal transduction. DRM-association is a read-out of whether a protein is likely to associate with rafts that form under these conditions.},

  abstract = {Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum) were fed purified diets containing fish oil for six weeks and then soybean lecithin or soybean oil for 25 days. The gastrointestinal tract segments, stomach, midgut and hindgut were then sampled for lipid and fatty acid composition and electron microscopy. Membrane lipid class composition was fairly similar in all three segments of trout fed fish oil. Hindgut contained slightly more phosphatidylserine than stomach andmidgut,while midgut containedmore phosphatidylcholine and less lysophos- patidylcholine/sphingomyelin. Feeding soybean products appeared to marginally decrease free cholesterol. The fatty acid compositions of the main lipid classes showed significant regional differences. In control fish, stomach had higher levels of arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids than midgut and hindgut, and lower content of docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Midgut phosphatidyleth- anolamine also had higher levels of saturated fatty acids and less n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids than the other tissues. Feeding soybean products decreased the n-3/n-6 ratio mainly due to increases in linoleic (18:2n-6) and 20:4n-6 and decreases in 22:6n-3 and eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3). Phosphatidylcholine and to a lesser extent phosphatidylethanolamine adapted more readily to dietary changes by major increases in 18:2n-6 and C20−22 n- 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids. The composition of phosphatidyl-serine and -inositol appeared to be under more strict metabolic control. Linoleic acid hardly increased at all while the increase in other n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids was less pronounced than for the other lipid classes. Regardless of lipid class, stomach resisted dietary changes more strongly than midgut and hindgut. Increases in n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids were minor as were the loss of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. The dead-end product 20:2n-6 accumulated to a higher degree in hindgut phosphatidyl-ethanolamineand -coline compared tomidgut and stomach, suggesting that the activity of6 desaturation is higher in the anterior part of the intestine where most of the lipid is absorbed. Feeding soybean oil caused massive accumulation of free lipid droplets in midgut enterocytes while little lipid droplets were observed in trout fed fish oil or soybean lecithin.

  abstract = {The aim of the study was to investigate the replacement of fish oil by vegetable oils and the effects of a washout with a return to fish oil on growth performances and lipid metabolism. Three experimental fish meal-based isonitrogenous (crude protein content: 57.5{\%}) and isolipidic (crude lipid content: 16.5{\%}) diets were formulated containing either 9{\%} of added fish oil (FO), soybean oil (SO), or linseed oil (LO). Each diet was distributed to triplicate groups of 25 marketable size turbot (initial body weight of 579 g) grown in seawater at water temperature of 17°C. Fish were fed once a day to visual satiety. At the end of the growth trial, which lasted 13 weeks, all groups of turbot were fed with FO diet for 8 weeks. The growth of turbot was high, but the incorporation of vegetable oils in the diets resulted in a slight decrease in growth as compared to those fed with fish oil-based diet. Feed and protein efficiency and whole body composition were not affected by dietary lipid sources. Total lipid content was low in the muscle of turbot (below 2{\%}); ventral muscle being fatter than dorsal muscle. Liver and muscle fatty acid (FA) composition reflected dietary FA composition. Liver and muscle of fish fed with SO diet were rich in 18:2n-6, whereas those of fish fed with LO diet were rich in 18:3n-3. Liver and muscle of fish fed with SO and LO diets had lower levels of 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 in comparison to those of fish fed with FO diet. In turbot, hepatic lipogenic enzyme activities were low and not influenced by dietary lipid source. At the end of the second period, after transfer to FO-based diets, muscle FA composition of fish fed previously with SO and LO diets were still different to those of fish fed with FO diet. The values of 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3, respectively, were lower than the values found at the end of the growth period, but higher than those of fish fed with FO diet. An increase of FA levels, characteristic of fish oil, was observed in the liver and muscle of fish previously fed with vegetable oils. Data obtained show that replacement of fish oil by vegetable oils is possible with negligible impact on growth performance of turbot, that dietary lipids are an effective vector to influence the nutritional quality of finished product, and that a duration of 8 weeks is not sufficient to bring the FA profile of turbot of this size back to that of fish fed with fish oil over the whole period. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this work, we ejected intact assemblies from membranes, without chemical disruption, and used mass spectrometry to define their composition. From   outer membranes, we identified a chaperone-porin association and lipid interactions in the β-barrel assembly machinery. We observed efflux pumps bridging inner and outer membranes, and from inner membranes we identified a pentameric pore of TonB, as well as the protein-conducting channel SecYEG in association with F F  adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase. Intact mitochondrial membranes from   yielded respiratory complexes and fatty acid-bound dimers of the ADP (adenosine diphosphate)/ATP translocase (ANT-1). These results highlight the importance of native membrane environments for retaining small-molecule binding, subunit interactions, and associated chaperones of the membrane proteome.},

  abstract     = {With the recent success in determining membrane protein structures, further detailed understanding of the identity and function of the bound lipidome is essential. Using an approach that combines high-energy native mass spectrometry (HE-nMS) and solution-phase lipid profiling, this protocol can be used to determine the identity of the endogenous lipids that directly interact with a protein. Furthermore, this method can identify systems in which such lipid binding has a major role in regulating the oligomeric assembly of membrane proteins. The protocol begins with recording of the native mass spectrum of the protein of interest, under successive delipidation conditions, to determine whether delipidation leads to disruption of the oligomeric state. Subsequently, we propose using a bipronged strategy: first, an HE-nMS platform is used that allows dissociation of the detergent micelle at the front end of the instrument. This allows for isolation of the protein-lipid complex at the quadrupole and successive fragmentation at the collision cell, which leads to identification of the bound lipid masses. Next, simultaneous coupling of this with in-solution LC-MS/MS-based identification of extracted lipids reveals the complete identity of the interacting lipidome that copurifies with the proteins. Assimilation of the results of these two sets of experiments divulges the complete identity of the set of lipids that directly interact with the membrane protein of interest, and can further delineate its role in maintaining the oligomeric state of the protein. The entire procedure takes 2 d to complete.},

  abstract        = {Cholesterol is an essential component of eukaryotic membranes and plays a crucial role in membrane organization, dynamics and function. The modulatory role of cholesterol in the function of a number of membrane proteins is well established. This effect has been proposed to occur either due to a specific molecular interaction between cholesterol and membrane proteins or due to alterations in the membrane physical properties induced by the presence of cholesterol. The contemporary view regarding heterogeneity in cholesterol distribution in membrane domains that sequester certain types of membrane proteins while excluding others has further contributed to its significance in membrane protein function. The seven transmembrane domain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are among the largest protein families in mammals and represent approximately 2% of the total proteins coded by the human genome. Signal transduction events mediated by this class of proteins are the primary means by which cells communicate with and respond to their external environment. GPCRs therefore represent major targets for the development of novel drug candidates in all clinical areas. In view of their importance in cellular signaling, the interaction of cholesterol with such receptors represents an important determinant in functional studies of such receptors. This review focuses on the effect of cholesterol on the membrane organization and function of GPCRs from a variety of sources, with an emphasis on the more contemporary role of cholesterol in maintaining a domain-like organization of such receptors on the cell surface. Importantly, the recently reported role of cholesterol in the function and organization of the neuronal serotonin(1A) receptor, a representative of the GPCR family which is present endogenously in the hippocampal region of the brain, will be highlighted.},

The concepts of hydrophobic matching and curvature stress are revisited in light of recent data obtained from experimental and theoretical studies which demonstrate that not only do integral proteins perturb the lipids, but the physical state of the lipids does also actively influence protein function. The case of the trans-membrane water-channel protein aquaporin GlpF from E. coli imbedded in lipid-bilayer membranes is discussed in some detail. Numerical data obtained from Molecular Dynamics simulations show on the one side that the lipid bilayer adapts to the channel by a hydrophobic matching condition which reflects the propensity of the lipid molecules for forming curved structures. On the other side, it is demonstrated that the transport function of the channel is modulated by the matching condition and/or the curvature stress in a lipid-specific manner.},
