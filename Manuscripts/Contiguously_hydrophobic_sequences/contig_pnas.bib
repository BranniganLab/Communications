  title       = {Variants of intrinsic disorder in the human proteome},
  abstract    = {In this paper we propose a straightforward operational definition of variants of disordered proteins, taking the human proteome as a case study. The focus is on a distinction between mostly unstructured proteins and proteins which contain long unstructured regions accommodated in an overall folded structure. In particular we distinguish: i) Not disordered proteins (NDPs), that either have all their residues ordered or do not have disordered segments longer than 30 residues nor more than 30% of disordered residues; ii) Proteins with intrinsically disordered regions (IDRPs), that have at least one disordered domain longer than 30 residues, but disordered in less than 30% of their residues; iii) Proteins that are intrinsically disordered (IDPs), that have both at least one disordered segment longer than 30 residues and that are disordered on more than 30% of their residues; iv) Proteins with fragmented disorder (FRAG_IDPs), that do not have a disordered fragment longer than 30 residues but that, nevertheless, have at least 30% or more of their residues predicted as disordered. The potential use of these variants is checked over several groups of disease-related proteins. Our main conclusions point out that IDRPs are more similar to NDPs than to IDPs. IDRPs and NDPs have a similar functional repertoire and probably share a lock-and-key mechanism of interaction with substrates. IDRPs and IDPs are differently present among human disease-related proteins. IDRPs probably do not play a specific role in the development of complex diseases, since their frequency is similar in disease-related proteins and in the entire human proteome. IDPs can play a role in the emergence of cancer, neurodegenerative, thyroid and liver disease.},

  abstract        = {We analyzed the total, hydrophobic, and hydrophilic accessible surfaces (ASAs) of residues from a nonredundant bank of 587 3D structure proteins. In an extended fold, residues are classified into three families with respect to their hydrophobicity balance. As expected, residues lose part of their solvent-accessible surface with folding but the three groups remain. The decrease of accessibility is more pronounced for hydrophobic than hydrophilic residues. Amazingly, Lysine is the residue with the largest hydrophobic accessible surface in folded structures. Our analysis points out a clear difference between the mean (other studies) and median (this study) ASA values of hydrophobic residues, which should be taken into consideration for future investigations on a protein-accessible surface, in order to improve predictions requiring ASA values. The different secondary structures correspond to different accessibility of residues. Random coils, turns, and beta-structures (outside beta-sheets) are the most accessible folds, with an average of 30% accessibility. The helical residues are about 20% accessible, and the difference between the hydrophobic and the hydrophilic residues illustrates the amphipathy of many helices. Residues from beta-sheets are the most inaccessible to solvent (10% accessible). Hence, beta-sheets are the most appropriate structures to shield the hydrophobic parts of residues from water. We also show that there is an equal balance between the hydrophobic and the hydrophilic accessible surfaces of the 3D protein surfaces irrespective of the protein size. This results in a patchwork surface of hydrophobic and hydrophilic areas, which could be important for protein interactions and/or activity.},

An important property intrinsic to hydrophobic interaction is its cooperative nature, which is originated from the collective motions of water hydrogen bond networks surrounding hydrophobic solutes. This property is widely believed to enhance the formation of hydrophobic core in proteins. However, cooperativity in hydrophobic interactions has not been successfully characterized by experiments. Here, we quantify cooperativity in hydrophobic interactions by real-time monitoring the aggregation of hydrophobic solute (hexaphenylsilole, HPS) in a microfluidic mixer. We show that association of a HPS molecule to its aggregate in water occurs at sub-microsecond, and the free energy change is -5.8 to -13.6 kcal mol . Most strikingly, we discover that cooperativity constitutes up to 40% of this free energy. Our results provide quantitative evidence for the critical role of cooperativity in hydrophobic interactions.},

  abstract = "We have conducted a comprehensive search for conserved elements
              in vertebrate genomes, using genome-wide multiple alignments of
              five vertebrate species (human, mouse, rat, chicken, and Fugu
              rubripes). Parallel searches have been performed with multiple
              alignments of four insect species (three species of Drosophila
              and Anopheles gambiae), two species of Caenorhabditis, and seven
              species of Saccharomyces. Conserved elements were identified with
              a computer program called phastCons, which is based on a
              two-state phylogenetic hidden Markov model (phylo-HMM). PhastCons
              works by fitting a phylo-HMM to the data by maximum likelihood,
              subject to constraints designed to calibrate the model across
              species groups, and then predicting conserved elements based on
              this model. The predicted elements cover roughly 3\%-8\% of the
              human genome (depending on the details of the calibration
              procedure) and substantially higher fractions of the more compact
              Drosophila melanogaster (37\%-53\%), Caenorhabditis elegans

              From yeasts to vertebrates, in order of increasing genome size
              and general biological complexity, increasing fractions of
              conserved bases are found to lie outside of the exons of known
              protein-coding genes. In all groups, the most highly conserved
              elements (HCEs), by log-odds score, are hundreds or thousands of
              bases long. These elements share certain properties with
              ultraconserved elements, but they tend to be longer and less
              perfectly conserved, and they overlap genes of somewhat different
              functional categories. In vertebrates, HCEs are associated with
              the 3' UTRs of regulatory genes, stable gene deserts, and
              megabase-sized regions rich in moderately conserved noncoding
              sequences. Noncoding HCEs also show strong statistical evidence
              of an enrichment for RNA secondary structure.",

               Functional characterization of mechanisms at GWAS loci is a
               multi-faceted challenge. Challenges include linkage
               disequilibrium and allelic heterogeneity at each locus, the

               experimentally evaluating the potential mechanistic
               contributions of genes and variants. As GWAS sample sizes
               increase, more loci are identified, and the complexities of
               individual loci emerge. Loci can consist of multiple association
               signals, each of which can reflect the influence of multiple
               variants, inseparable by association analyses. Each signal
               within a locus can influence the same or different target genes.
               Experimental studies of genes and variants can differ on the
               basis of cell type, cellular environment, or other
               context-specific variables. In this review, we describe the
               complexity of mechanisms at GWAS loci-including multiple
               signals, multiple variants, and/or multiple genes-and the

  author    = "Llaurens, Violaine and Whibley, Annabel and Joron, Mathieu",
  abstract  = "Balancing selection describes any form of natural selection,
               which results in the persistence of multiple variants of a trait
               at intermediate frequencies within populations. By offering up a
               snapshot of multiple co-occurring functional variants and their
               interactions, systems under balancing selection can reveal the
               evolutionary mechanisms favouring the emergence and persistence
               of adaptive variation in natural populations. We here focus on
               the mechanisms by which several functional variants for a given
               trait can arise, a process typically requiring multiple
               epistatic mutations. We highlight how balancing selection can
               favour specific features in the genetic architecture and review
               the evolutionary and molecular mechanisms shaping this
               architecture. First, balancing selection affects the number of
               loci underlying differentiated traits and their respective
               effects. Control by one or few loci favours the persistence of
               differentiated functional variants by limiting intergenic
               recombination, or its impact, and may sometimes lead to the
               evolution of supergenes. Chromosomal rearrangements,
               particularly inversions, preventing adaptive combinations from
               being dissociated are increasingly being noted as features of
               such systems. Similarly, due to the frequency of heterozygotes
               maintained by balancing selection, dominance may be a key
               property of adaptive variants. High heterozygosity and limited
               recombination also influence associated genetic load, as linked
               recessive deleterious mutations may be sheltered. The capture of
               deleterious elements in a locus under balancing selection may
               reinforce polymorphism by further promoting heterozygotes.
               Finally, according to recent genomewide scans, balanced
               polymorphism might be more pervasive than generally thought. We
               stress the need for both functional and ecological studies to
               characterize the evolutionary mechanisms operating in these
               systems.",

               increased in the last few years in parallel with the
               availability of large genomic datasets. The release of large
               datasets composed of millions of SNPs across hundreds of genomes
               by HAPMAP, the Human Genome Diversity Panel, and other projects
               has led to considerable effort to detect selection signals
               across the nuclear genome (Coop et al., 2009; Lopez Herraez et
               al., 2009; Sabeti et al., 2006, 2007; Voight et al., 2006). Most
               of the research has focused on positive selection forces
               although other selective forces, such as negative selection, may
               have played a substantive role on the shape of our genome. Here
               we studied the selective strengths acting presently on the
               genome by making computational predictions of the pathogenicity
               of nonsynonymous protein mutations and interpreting the
               distribution of scores in terms of selection. We could show that
               the genetic diversity for all the major pathways is still
               constrained by negative selection in all 11 human populations
               studied. In a single exception, we observed a relaxation of
               negative selection acting on olfactory receptors. Since a
               decreased number of functioning olfactory receptors in human
               compared with other primates had already been shown, this
               suggests that the role of olfactory receptors for survival and
               reproductive success has decreased during human evolution. By
               showing that negative selection is still relaxed, the present
               results imply that no plateau of minimal function has yet been
               reached in modern humans and therefore that olfactory capability
               might still be decreasing. This is a first clue to present human

  abstract  = "Selection against deleterious alleles maintained by mutation may
               cause a reduction in the amount of genetic variability at linked
               neutral sites. This is because a new neutral variant can only
               remain in a large population for a long period of time if it is
               maintained in gametes that are free of deleterious alleles, and
               hence are not destined for rapid elimination from the population
               by selection. Approximate formulas are derived for the reduction
               below classical neutral values resulting from such background
               selection against deleterious mutations, for the mean times to
               fixation and loss of new mutations, nucleotide site diversity,
               and number of segregating sites. These formulas apply to
               random-mating populations with no genetic recombination, and to
               populations reproducing exclusively asexually or by
               self-fertilization. For a given selection regime and mating
               system, the reduction is an exponential function of the total
               mutation rate to deleterious mutations for the section of the
               genome involved. Simulations show that the effect decreases
               rapidly with increasing recombination frequency or rate of
               outcrossing. The mean time to loss of new neutral mutations and
               the total number of segregating neutral sites are less sensitive
               to background selection than the other statistics, unless the
               population size is of the order of a hundred thousand or more.
               The stationary distribution of allele frequencies at the neutral
               sites is correspondingly skewed in favor of rare alleles,
               compared with the classical neutral result. Observed reductions
               in molecular variation in low recombination genomic regions of
               sufficiently large size, for instance in the centromere-proximal
               regions of Drosophila autosomes or in highly selfing plant
