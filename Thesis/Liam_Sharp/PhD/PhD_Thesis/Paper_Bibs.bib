abstract = {Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) with 22-carbons and 6 double bonds is the extreme example of an $\omega$-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). DHA has strong medical implications since its dietary presence has been positively linked to the prevention of numerous human afflictions including cancer and heart disease. The PUFA, moreover, is essential to neurological function. It is remarkable that one simple molecule has been reported to affect so many seemingly unrelated biological processes. Although details of a molecular mode of action remain elusive, DHA must be acting at a fundamental level common to many tissues that is related to the high degree of conformational flexibility that the multiple double bonds have been identified to confer. One likely target for DHA action is at the cell membrane where the fatty acid is known to readily incorporate into membrane phospholipids. Once esterified into phospholipids DHA has been demonstrated to significantly alter many basic properties of membranes including acyl chain order and "fluidity", phase behavior, elastic compressibility, permeability, fusion, flip-flop and protein activity. It is concluded that DHA's interaction with other membrane lipids, particularly cholesterol, may play a prominent role in modulating the local structure and function of cell membranes. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Although results of recent solid-state NMR measurements and molecular simulations have confirmed the existence of these structural motifs, they portray an image of DHA (22:6n-3) as a highly flexible molecule with rapid transitions between large numbers of conformers on the time scale from picoseconds to hundreds of nanoseconds. The low barriers to torsional rotation about C-C bonds that link the cis-locked double bonds with the methylene carbons between them are responsible for this unusual flexibility.

abstract = {We study membrane-protein interactions and membrane-mediated protein-protein interactions by Monte Carlo simulations of a generic coarse-grained model for lipid bilayers with cylindrical hydrophobic inclusions. The strength of the hydrophobic force and the hydrophobic thickness of the proteins are systematically varied. The results are compared with analytical predictions of two popular analytical theories: The Landau-de Gennes theory and the elastic theory. The elastic theory provides an excellent description of the fluctuation spectra of pure membranes and successfully reproduces the deformation profiles of membranes around single proteins. However, its prediction for the potential of mean force between proteins is not compatible with the simulation data for large distances. The simulations show that the lipid-mediated interactions are governed by five competing factors: direct interactions; lipid-induced depletion interactions; lipid bridging; lipid packing; and a smooth long-range contribution. The mechanisms leading to hydrophobic mismatch interactions are critically analyzed. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the Biophysical Society.},

  abstract        = {Cholesterol is a potent modulator of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) from Torpedo. Here, we review current understanding of the mechanisms underlying cholesterol-nAChR interactions in the context of increasingly available high-resolution structural and functional data. Cholesterol and other lipids influence function by conformational selection and kinetic mechanisms, stabilizing varying proportions of activatable vs nonactivatable conformations, as well as influencing the rates of transitions between conformational states. In the absence of cholesterol and anionic lipids, the nAChR adopts an uncoupled conformation that binds agonist but does not undergo agonist-induced conformational transitions-unless the nAChR is located in a relatively thick lipid bilayer, such as that found in cholesterol-rich lipid rafts. We highlight different sites of cholesterol action, including the lipid-exposed M4 transmembrane α-helix. Cholesterol and other lipids likely alter function by modulating interactions between M4 and the adjacent transmembrane α-helices, M1 and M3. These same interactions have been implicated in both the folding and trafficking of nAChRs to the cell surface. We evaluate the nature of cholesterol-nAChR interactions, considering the evidence supporting the roles of both direct binding to allosteric sites and cholesterol-induced changes in bulk membrane physical properties.},

abstract = {The Gaussian curvature modulus $\kappa$ of lipid bilayers likely contributes more than 100 kcal/mol to every cellular fission or fusion event. This huge impact on membrane remodeling energetics might be a factor that codetermines the complex lipid composition of biomembranes through tuning of $\kappa$. Yet, its value has been measured only for a handful of simple lipids, and no simulation has so far determined it better than a factor of two, rendering a systematic investigation of such enticing speculations impossible. Here we propose a highly accurate method to determine $\kappa$ in computer simulations. It relies on the interplay between curvature stress and edge tension of partially curved axisymmetric membrane disks and requires determining their closing probability. For a simplified lipid model we obtain $\kappa$ and its relation to the normal bending modulus $\kappa$ for membranes differing both in stiffness and spontaneous lipid curvature. The elastic ratio $\kappa$/$\kappa$ can be determined with a few percent statistical accuracy. Its value agrees with the scarce experimental data, and its change with spontaneous lipid curvature is compatible with theoretical expectations, thereby granting additional information on monolayer properties. We also show that an alternative determination of these elastic parameters based on moments of the lateral stress profile gives markedly different and unphysical values. {\textcopyright} 2012 Biophysical Society.},

Given the wide disparity between what is possible on today's computers and the problems one might like to study, it seems unlikely this situation will change for several decades. An appealing alternative to traditional computational approaches is to employ simpler, continuum-based models developed within the frameworks of elasticity theory, fluid dynamics, and statistical mechanics. Although such models have seen wide use in analytical descriptions of membrane behavior, the extension of these methods to more general situations and numerical analysis is just beginning to be explored. This article reviews continuum models for membrane behavior with an emphasis on the use of such models in computational studies. Two applications are explored to demonstrate the utility of this level of coarse-grained modeling.},

abstract = {Aided by efforts to improve their speed and efficiency, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide an increasingly powerful tool to study the structure–function relationship of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs). However, accurate reporting of the channel state and observation of allosteric regulation by agonist binding with MD remains difficult due to the timescales necessary to equilibrate pLGICs from their artificial and crystalized conformation to a more native, membrane-bound conformation in silico. Here, we perform multiple all-atom MD simulations of the homomeric 5-hydroxytryptamine 3A (5-HT3A) serotonin receptor for 15 to 20 $\mu$s to demonstrate that such timescales are critical to observe the equilibration of a pLGIC from its crystalized conformation to a membrane-bound conformation. These timescales, which are an order of magnitude longer than any previous simulation of 5-HT3A, allow us to observe the dynamic binding and unbinding of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) (i.e., serotonin) to the binding pocket located on the extracellular domain (ECD) and allosteric regulation of the transmembrane domain (TMD) from synergistic 5-HT binding. While these timescales are not long enough to observe complete activation of 5-HT3A, the allosteric regulation of ion gating elements by 5-HT binding is indicative of a preactive state, which provides insight into molecular mechanisms that regulate channel activation from a resting state. This mechanistic insight, enabled by microsecond-timescale MD simulations, will allow a careful examination of the regulation of pLGICs at a molecular level, expanding our understanding of their function and elucidating key structural motifs that can be targeted for therapeutic regulation.},

abstract = {Biological membranes deform in response to resident proteins leading to a coupling between membrane shape and protein localization. Additionally, the membrane influences the function of membrane proteins. Here we review contributions to this field from continuum elastic membrane models focusing on the class of models that couple the protein to the membrane. While it has been argued that continuum models cannot reproduce the distortions observed in fully-atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we suggest that this failure can be overcome by using chemically accurate representations of the protein. We outline our recent advances along these lines with our hybrid continuum-atomistic model, and we show the model is in excellent agreement with fully-atomistic simulations of the nhTMEM16 lipid scramblase. We believe that the speed and accuracy of continuum-atomistic methodologies will make it possible to simulate large scale, slow biological processes, such as membrane morphological changes, that are currently beyond the scope of other computational approaches.

abstract = {Achieving perfect skin regeneration after wounding remains challenging because of the lack of fundamental understanding of the harmonious interplay among different cell types, complex cell signaling networks and mechanical feedback loops evolving in space and time during healing. Here we show a novel computational framework to simulate the healing of wounds that brings together knowledge from continuum mechanics, growth and remodeling, and systems biology regulatory networks. At the tissue scale we consider a field of displacements that satisfies linear momentum balance, and continuous fields for cells and chemical signal concentrations which obey reaction–diffusion equations. At the cell scale a set of ordinary differential equations describe the dynamics of remodeling. Our major contribution is the modeling and simulation of the coupling of cellular and chemical fields to tissue-level mechanics via local changes in fiber alignment, dispersion, collagen content, permanent area change, elastic deformation, and active contraction. Numerically, the constitutive equations for remodeling are solved at the integration points while the displacements and biological fields are solved monolithically with a finite element formulation. The method presented here is at the junction of applied mechanics and systems biology, two exciting fields that continue to approach each other as we seek to unravel the basic principles of mechanical adaptation in living materials with the aid of computational simulations.},

We find that the membrane thickness, which is perturbed from its equilibrium value by the coupling to the embedded inclusions, decays non-monotonically with distance from the inclusion boundary. As a result, the membrane-induced interactions between inclusions vary non monotonically with spacing. The periodicity of the perturbation profile, as well as the strength and range of the induced interactions, are proportional to the ratio of the amphiphile bending modulus and compressibility. In systems where the inclusions impose a thickness-matching constraint, the induced interactions are attractive. However, the presence of an energy barrier at a finite spacing may hinder aggregation. In systems where the inclusions impose a specific contact-angle, the interaction energy is minimal at a finite inclusion spacing.},

abstract = {Biological membranes deform in response to resident proteins leading to a coupling between membrane shape and protein localization. Additionally, the membrane influences the function of membrane proteins. Here we review contributions to this field from continuum elastic membrane models focusing on the class of models that couple the protein to the membrane. While it has been argued that continuum models cannot reproduce the distortions observed in fully-atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we suggest that this failure can be overcome by using chemically accurate representations of the protein. We outline our recent advances along these lines with our hybrid continuum-atomistic model, and we show the model is in excellent agreement with fully-atomistic simulations of the nhTMEM16 lipid scramblase. We believe that the speed and accuracy of continuum-atomistic methodologies will make it possible to simulate large scale, slow biological processes, such as membrane morphological changes, that are currently beyond the scope of other computational approaches. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Membrane Proteins edited by J.C. Gumbart and Sergei Noskov.},

abstract = {Membrane remodelling plays an important role in cellular tasks such as endocytosis, vesiculation and protein sorting, and in the biogenesis of organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi apparatus. It is well established that the remodelling process is aided by specialized proteins that can sense as well as create membrane curvature, and trigger tubulation when added to synthetic liposomes. Because the energy needed for such large-scale changes in membrane geometry significantly exceeds the binding energy between individual proteins and between protein and membrane, cooperative action is essential. It has recently been suggested that curvature-mediated attractive interactions could aid cooperation and complement the effects of specific binding events on membrane remodelling. But it is difficult to experimentally isolate curvature-mediated interactions from direct attractions between proteins. Moreover, approximate theories predict repulsion between isotropically curving proteins. Here we use coarse-grained membrane simulations to show that curvature-inducing model proteins adsorbed on lipid bilayer membranes can experience attractive interactions that arise purely as a result of membrane curvature. We find that once a minimal local bending is realized, the effect robustly drives protein cluster formation and subsequent transformation into vesicles with radii that correlate with the local curvature imprint. Owing to its universal nature, curvature-mediated attraction can operate even between proteins lacking any specific interactions, such as newly synthesized and still immature membrane proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum.},

abstract = {We calculate the Gaussian curvature modulus (k) over bar of a systematically coarse-grained (CG) one-component lipid membrane by applying the method recently proposed by Hu et al. [Biophys. J., 2012, 102, 1403] to the MARTINI representation of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC). We find the value (k) over bar /k = -1.04 +/- 0.03 for the elastic ratio between the Gaussian and the mean curvature modulus and deduce (k) over bar (m)/k(m) approximate to -0.98 +/- 0.09 for the monolayer elastic ratio, where the latter is based on plausible assumptions for the distance z(0) of the monolayer neutral surface from the bilayer midplane and the spontaneous lipid curvature K-0m. By also analyzing the lateral stress profile sigma(0)(z) of our system, two other lipid types and pertinent data from the literature, we show that determining K-0m and (k) over bar through the first and second moment of sigma(0)(z) gives rise to physically implausible values for these observables. This discrepancy, which we previously observed for a much simpler CG model, suggests that the moment conditions derived from simple continuum assumptions miss the effect of physically important correlations in the lipid bilayer.},

abstract = {We present an elastic Hamiltonian for membrane energetics that captures bilayer undulation and peristaltic deformations over all wavelengths, including the short wavelength protrusion regime. The model implies continuous functional forms for thermal undulation and peristaltic amplitudes as a function of wavelength and predicts previously overlooked relationships between these curves. Undulation and peristaltic spectra display excellent agreement with data from both atomistic and coarse-grained models over all simulated length scales. Additionally, the model accurately predicts the bilayer's response to a cylindrical protein inclusion as observed in coarse-grained simulation. This elastic response provides an explanation for gramicidin ion channel lifetime versus membrane thickness data that requires no fit constants. The physical parameters inherent to this picture may be expressed in terms of familiar material properties associated with lipid monolayers. Inclusion of a finite monolayer spontaneous curvature is essential to obtain fully consistent agreement between theory and the full range of available simulation/experimental data. {\textcopyright} 2006 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {In one of the most extensive analyses to date we show that the balance of diet n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is the most important determinant of membrane composition in the rat under 'normal' conditions. Young adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed one of twelve moderate-fat diets (25{\%} of total energy) for 8 weeks. Diets differed only in fatty acid (FA) profiles, with saturate (SFA) content ranging 8-88{\%} of total FAs, monounsaturate (MUFA) 6-65{\%}, total PUFA 4-81{\%}, n-6 PUFA 3-70{\%} and n-3 PUFA 1-70{\%}. Diet PUFA included only essential FAs 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3. Balance between n-3 and n-6 PUFA is defined as the PUFA balance (n-3 PUFA as {\%} of total PUFA) and ranged 1-86{\%} in the diets. FA composition was measured for brain, heart, liver, skeletal muscle, erythrocytes and plasma phospholipids, as well as adipose tissue and plasma triglycerides. The conformer-regulator model was used (slope = 1 indicates membrane composition completely conforming to diet). Extensive changes in diet SFA, MUFA and PUFA had minimal effect on membranes (average slopes 0.01, 0.07, 0.07 respectively), but considerable influence on adipose tissue and plasma triglycerides (average slopes 0.27, 0.53, 0.47 respectively). Diet balance between n-3 and n-6 PUFA had a biphasic influence on membrane composition. When n-3 PUFA {\textless} 10{\%} of total PUFA, membrane composition completely conformed to diet (average slope 0.95), while diet PUFA balance {\textgreater} 10{\%} had little influence (average slope 0.19).

abstract = {The structural and functional properties of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR), the archetype molecule in the superfamily of Cys-looped ligand-gated ion channels, are strongly dependent on the lipids in the vicinal microenvironment. The influence on receptor properties is mainly exerted by the AChR-vicinal (" shell " or " annular ") lipids, which occur in the liquid-ordered phase as opposed to the more disordered and " fluid " bulk membrane lipids. Fluorescence studies from our laboratory have identified discrete sites for fatty acids, phospholipids, and cholesterol on the AChR protein, and electron-spin resonance spectros-copy has enabled the establishment of the stoichiometry and selectivity of the shell lipid for the AChR and the disclosure of lipid sites in the AChR transmembrane region. Experimental evidence supports the notion that the interface between the protein moiety and the adjacent lipid shell is the locus of a variety of pharmacologically relevant processes, including the action of steroids and other lipids. I surmise that the outermost ring of M4 helices constitutes the boundary interface, most suitable to convey the signals from the lipid microenviron-ment to the rest of the transmembrane region, and to the channel inner ring in particular. In memoriam Gaspar Fernandez-Nievas The AChR at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and at central nervous system cholinergic synapses is the key transducer of the chemical signal involved in cellular communication between nerve and vertebrate skeletal muscle and between neurons. Several genes coding for AChR subunits have been characterized within the super-family, also known as Cys-loop receptors. They exhibit not only amino acid sequence homology but, presumably, higher-order structural motifs. Until recently, the Cys-loop family was thought to comprise only ion channels produced by eukaryotic genes, but prokaryotic ion channels with remarkable structural similarity to members of the AChR family have recently been discovered (Bocquet et al. 2007, 2009; Hilf and Dutzler 2008). Each AChR subunit contains four hydrophobic seg-ments, 20–30 amino acids in length, the M1–M4 membrane-spanning segments. We have proposed that, in addition to these two main regions of the AChR, a third important domain is defined at the extensive interface between the protein and lipid moieties, comprising both the lipid-exposed TM portions of the AChR protein and the AChR-vicinal lipid (Barrantes 2003, 2004; Albuquerque et al. 2009). The latter corresponds to the lipid belt (" shell " , " annulus " , " boundary " , " AChR-vicinal ") region, which is the lipid moiety in the immediate perimeter of the AChR protein, earlier discovered using electron spin resonance (ESR) techniques (Marsh and Barrantes 1978) and further characterized in terms of lipid selectivity and stoichiometry (Barrantes 2004). In order to define the physical state of the AChR membrane lipids, we fostered two hitherto unexploited properties of the fluorescent probe Laurdan: (1) its ability to act as a F{\"{o}}rster-type resonance energy transfer (FRET) acceptor of tryptophan emission (Antollini et al.},

No effective therapy for preventing or arresting the neurologic regression in the disease in its various clinical presentations is available. Based on our prior evidence of enhanced O.S. and lipid peroxidation in RTT patients, herein we tested the possible therapeutic effects of {\$}\omega{\$}-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ({\$}\omega{\$}-3 PUFAs), known antioxidants with multiple effects, on the clinical symptoms and O.S. biomarkers in the earliest stage of RTT.

Primary outcomes were potential changes in clinical symptoms, with secondary outcomes including variations for five O.S. markers in plasma and/or erythrocytes (nonprotein bound iron, F2-dihomo-isoprostanes, F3-isoprostanes, F4-neuroprostanes, and F2-isoprostanes). A significant reduction in the clinical severity (in particular, motor-related signs, nonverbal communication deficits, and breathing abnormalities) together with a significant decrease in all the examined O.S. markers was observed in the {\$}\omega{\$}-3 PUFAs supplemented patients, whereas no significant changes were evidenced in the untreated group. For the first time, these findings strongly suggest that a dietary intervention in this genetic disease at an early stage of its natural history can lead to a partial clinical and biochemical rescue. {\textcopyright}Springer-Verlag 2012.},

abstract = {The accretion of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in membranes of the central nervous system is required for the optimum development of retina and brain functions. DHA status is determined by the dietary intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), both the metabolic precursor {\$}\alpha{\$}-linolenic acid ({\$}\alpha{\$}-LNA) and DHA. Clinical studies have shown that feeding term or premature infants with formula low in total n-3 PUFA may alter the maturation of visual acuity. Moreover, feeding infants over the first 6 mon of life with formula containing adequate {\$}\alpha{\$}-LNA, but no DHA, did not sustain the same cerebral accretion of DHA as that of breast-fed infants. Whether lower DHA accretion in brain of formula-fed term infants impairs neurophysiological performances is not clearly established. Contradictory data have been published, possibly owing to confounding factors such as maternal intakes and/or genetic variations in PUFA metabolism. Nevertheless, a large corpus of data is in favor of the recommendation of regular dietary intakes of DHA (during at least the first 6 mon of life) and suggest that DHA should be added in formulas at the level generally found in human milk (0.2-0.3 wt{\%} of total fatty acids). The maternal intake of n-3 PUFA during pregnancy and lactation is also crucial, since the n-3 PUFA are provided during perinatal development through placental transfer and maternal milk, which determines the DHA status of the newborn and consequently impacts on post-natal development of brain and visual functions. Whether more clinical studies are needed to control and improve the impact of DHA maternal intakes on the progeny's neurodevelopment, several commissions recommended by precaution that DHA average intake for pregnant and lactating women should be of 200-300 mg/day. 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

abstract = {Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was used to study the action of ethanol on the protein side chain motions of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAcChoR) in alkaline extracted membranes from Torpedo nobiliana. EPR spectra of the nAcChoR derivatized with maleimide spin label contain both strongly and weakly immobilized components. The rotational correlation time of the strongly immobilized component decreases by a factor of 2-3-fold with the addition of 1.6 M ethanol, while that of the weakly immobilized component is not significantly altered. EPR spectroscopy was also used to probe the lipid environment immediately surrounding the nAcChoR with stearic acid and phosphatidylcholine spin labeled at the fourteenth acyl carbons (14-SASL and 14-PCSL, respectively), and the steroid spin label androstanol (ASL). EPR spectra of these probes reveal a component corresponding to lipids that are motionally restricted by the receptor (annular lipids) in addition to a more fluid component arising from bulk lipid. Using spectral subtraction, the order of selectivity of these spin labels for the nAcChoR was determined to be ASL {\textgreater}or = 14-SASL {\textgreater}14-PCSL. The estimated rotational correlation times of the high affinity 14-SASL and ASL probes ranged from approx. 20 to 35 ns. The correlation times of the lower affinity 14-PCSL were generally shorter than those for 14-SASL and ASL and ranged from about 10 to 25 ns. The addition of up to 0.9 M ethanol altered neither the affinity nor the mobility of the motionally restricted EPR component. This suggests that ethanol's actions on the nAcChoR are not mediated via changes at the lipid/protein interface near the center of the bilayer.},

abstract = {The lipid dependence of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor from the Torpedo electric organ has long been recognized, and one of the most consistent experimental observations is that, when reconstituted in membranes formed by zwitterionic phospholipids alone, exposure to agonist fails to elicit ion-flux activity. More recently, it has been suggested that the bacterial homolog ELIC (Erwinia chrysanthemi ligand-gated ion channel) has a similar lipid sensitivity. As a first step toward the elucidation of the structural basis of this phenomenon, we solved the structures of ELIC embedded in palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine- (POPC-) only nanodiscs in both the unliganded (4.1-{\AA} resolution) and agonist-bound (3.3 {\AA}) states using single-particle cryoelectron microscopy. Comparison of the two structural models revealed that the largest differences occur at the level of loop C-at the agonist-binding sites-and the loops at the interface between the extracellular and transmembrane domains (ECD and TMD, respectively). On the other hand, the transmembrane pore is occluded in a remarkably similar manner in both structures. A straightforward interpretation of these findings is that POPC-only membranes frustrate the ECD-TMD coupling in such a way that the "conformational wave" of liganded-receptor gating takes place in the ECD and the interfacial M2-M3 linker but fails to penetrate the membrane and propagate into the TMD. Furthermore, analysis of the structural models and molecular simulations suggested that the higher affinity for agonists characteristic of the open- and desensitized-channel conformations results, at least in part, from the tighter confinement of the ligand to its binding site; this limits the ligand's fluctuations, and thus delays its escape into bulk solvent.},

Given the pathological importance of the {\$}\alpha{\$}2 nAChR subunit and the high sequence identity with {\$}\alpha{\$}4 (78{\%}) and other neuronal nAChR subunits, our findings offer valuable information for modeling several nAChRs and ultimately for structure-based design of subtype specific drugs against the nAChR associated diseases.},

abstract = {Fatty acid differences, including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) have been shown in the brains of Alzheimer's patients (AD) as compared with normal age-matched individuals. Furthermore, low serum DHA is a significant risk factor for the development of AD. The relative concentration of DHA and other fatty acids, however, in the plasma of AD patients compared with patients with other kinds of dementias (other dementias; OD), patients who are cognitively impaired but nondemented (CIND), or normal patients is not known. In this study we analyzed the total phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) fractions of plasma from patients diagnosed with AD, OD, or CIND and compared them with a group of elderly control subjects with normal cognitive functioning. Plasma phospholipid and PC levels of 20:5n-3, DHA, total n-3 fatty acids, and the n-3/n-6 ratio were lower in the AD, OD, and CIND groups. Plasma phospholipid 24:0 was lower in the AD, OD, and CIND groups as compared with the group of control patients, and total n-6 fatty acid levels were higher in the AD and CIND groups only. In the plasma PE fraction, levels of 20:5n-3, DHA, and the total n-3 fatty acid levels were significantly lower in the AD, OD, and CIND groups. DHA levels were lower in the lysoPC fraction of CIND individuals only. There were no other differences in the fatty acid compositions of the different phospholipid fractions. Therefore, in AD, OD, and CIND individuals, low levels of n-3 fatty acids in the plasma may be a risk factor for cognitive impairment and/or dementia. Interestingly, a decreased level of plasma DHA was not limited to the AD patients but appears to be common in cognitive impairment with aging},

abstract = {The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is a cation-selective channel central to both neuronal and muscular processes and is considered the prototype for ligand-gated ion channels, motivating a structural determination effort that spanned several decades [Unwin N (2005) Refined structure of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor at 4 A resolution. J Mol Biol 346:967-989]. Purified nAChR must be reconstituted in a mixture containing cholesterol to function. Proposed modes of interaction between cholesterol and the protein range from specific binding to indirect membrane-mediated mechanisms. However, the underlying cause of nAChR sensitivity to cholesterol remains controversial, in part because the vast majority of functional studies were conducted before a medium resolution structure was reported. We show that the nAChR contains internal sites capable of containing cholesterol, whose occupation stabilizes the protein structure. We detect sites at the protein-lipid interface as conventionally predicted from functional data, as well as deeply buried sites that are not usually considered. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that occupation of both superficial and deeply buried sites most effectively preserves the experimental structure; the structure collapses in the absence of bound cholesterol. In particular, we find that bound cholesterol directly supports contacts between the agonist-binding domain and the pore that are thought to be essential for activation of the receptor. These results likely apply to those other ion channels within the Cys-loop superfamily that depend on cholesterol, such as the GABA receptor.},

abstract = {The ability of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) to undergo conformational transitions is exquisitely sensitive to its surrounding lipid environment. Previous work has highlighted a conformational selection mechanism, whereby different lipids stabilize different proportions of activatable resting versus nonactivatable conformations. In the absence of anionic lipids and cholesterol, the nAChR adopts an uncoupled conformation, which binds agonist with resting state-like affinity but does not usually undergo agonist-induced conformational transitions. Very slow (minutes to hours) transitions from uncoupled to coupled (resting, open and/or desensitized) conformations, however, can occur in membranes with relatively thick hydrophobic cores. Increasing membrane hydrophobic thickness 'awakens' uncoupled nAChRs by reducing the large activation energy barrier (or barriers) leading to coupled states, thus allowing conformational transitions to occur on an experimentally tractable timescale. Lipids shape activity by modulating the relative proportions of activatable versus nonactivatable conformations and by controlling the transitions between uncoupled and coupled conformations.},

abstract = {Lipids play important roles in cellular dysfunction leading to disease. Although a major role for phospholipids is in defining the membrane permeability barrier, phospholipids play a central role in a diverse range of cellular processes and therefore are important factors in cellular dysfunction and disease. This review is focused on the role of phospholipids in normal assembly and organization of the membrane proteins, multimeric protein complexes, and higher order supercomplexes. Since lipids have no catalytic activity, it is difficult to determine their function at the molecular level. Lipid function has generally been defined by affects on protein function or cellular processes. Molecular details derived from genetic, biochemical, and structural approaches are presented for involvement of phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin in protein organization. Experimental evidence is presented that changes in phosphatidylethanolamine levels results in misfolding and topological misorientation of membrane proteins leading to dysfunctional proteins. Examples are presented for diseases in which proper protein folding or topological organization is not attained due to either demonstrated or proposed involvement of a lipid. Similar changes in cardiolipin levels affects the structure and function of individual components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and their organization into supercomplexes resulting in reduced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation efficiency and apoptosis. Diseases in which mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to reduced cardiolipin levels are described. Therefore, understanding the principles governing lipid-dependent assembly and organization of membrane proteins and protein complexes will be useful in developing novel therapeutic approaches for disorders in which lipids play an important role.},

abstract = {The {\$}\alpha{\$}4{\$}\beta{\$}2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) has significant roles in nervous system function and disease. It is also a molecular target of general anesthetics. Anesthetics inhibit the {\$}\alpha{\$}4{\$}\beta{\$}2 nAChR at clinically relevant concentrations, but their binding sites in {\$}\alpha{\$}4{\$}\beta{\$}2 remain unclear. The recently determined NMR structures of the {\$}\alpha{\$}4{\$}\beta{\$}2 nAChR transmembrane (TM) domains provide valuable frameworks for identifying the binding sites. In this study, we performed solution NMR experiments on the {\$}\alpha{\$}4{\$}\beta{\$}2 TM domains in the absence and presence of halothane and ketamine. Both anesthetics were found in an intra-subunit cavity near the extracellular end of the {\$}\beta{\$}2 transmembrane helices, homologous to a common anesthetic binding site observed in X-ray structures of anesthetic-bound GLIC (Nury et al., [32]). Halothane, but not ketamine, was also found in cavities adjacent to the common anesthetic site at the interface of {\$}\alpha{\$}4 and {\$}\beta{\$}2. In addition, both anesthetics bound to cavities near the ion selectivity filter at the intracellular end of the TM domains. Anesthetic binding induced profound changes in protein conformational exchanges. A number of residues, close to or remote from the binding sites, showed resonance signal splitting from single to double peaks, signifying that anesthetics decreased conformation exchange rates. It was also evident that anesthetics shifted population of two conformations. Altogether, the study comprehensively resolved anesthetic binding sites in the {\$}\alpha{\$}4{\$}\beta{\$}2 nAChR. Furthermore, the study provided compelling experimental evidence of anesthetic-induced changes in protein dynamics, especially near regions of the hydrophobic gate and ion selectivity filter that directly regulate channel functions. {\textcopyright}2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Anionic lipids and cholesterols (CHOL) are critical to the function of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR). We investigated their interactions with an open- and closed-channel alpha4beta2 nAChR by over 10 ns molecular dynamics simulations in a ternary lipid mixture of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidic acid (POPA), and CHOL with a ratio of 3:1:1 (Haddadian et al., J. Phys. Chem. B 2008, 112, 13981). On average there were 65 and 74 interfacial lipids around the closed- and open-channel alpha4beta2 nAChR, respectively, in the equilibrated simulation systems. In the open-channel system, 42{\%} of the interfacial POPA had acyl chains partially inserted into intra- or intersubunit cavities, as compared to only 7{\%} in the closed-channel alpha4beta2. No CHOL was found in cavities within single subunits, though some CHOL infiltrated into the gaps between subunits. Because of its smaller headgroup, POPA could access some nonannular sites where POPC could not easily reach due to steric exclusion. Furthermore, POPA acted not only as an acceptor for hydrogen bonding (H bonding) as POPC did, but also as a donor through its hydroxyl group for H bonding with the backbone of the protein. The charged headgroup of POPA allowed the lipid to form stable salt bridges with conserved Arg and Lys residues at the interfaces of the transmembrane (TM) and extracellular (EC) or intracellular (IC) domains of the alpha4beta2. A higher number of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds (H bonds) between POPA and the alpha4beta2 nAChR were found in the open system than in the closed system, suggesting a potential role of POPA in the equilibrium between different channel states. Most interfacial POPA molecules showed lower order parameters than the bulk POPA due to the mixed effect of gauche defects, hydrophobic mismatch, and the lipid orientations near the magic angle. These unique properties enable the interfacial POPA to achieve what POPC cannot with regard to specific interactions with the protein, thereby making POPA essential for the function of nAChR.},

Here, we take advantage of the prokaryote channel ELIC (Erwinia ligand-gated ion channel) as a model to understand the determinants of phospholipid interactions in this family of receptors. A high-resolution structure of ELIC in a lipid-bound state reveals a phospholipid site at the lower half of pore-forming transmembrane helices M1 and M4 and at a nearby site for neurosteroids, cholesterol or general anesthetics. This site is shaped by an M4-helix kink and a Trp–Arg–Pro triad that is highly conserved in eukaryote GABAA/C and glycine receptors. A combined approach reveals that M4 is intrinsically flexible and that M4 deletions or disruptions of the lipid-binding site accelerate desensitization in ELIC, suggesting that lipid interactions shape the agonist response. Our data offer a structural context for understanding lipid modulation in pLGICs.

abstract = {ELIC, the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel from Erwinia chrysanthemi, is a prototype for Cys-loop receptors. Here we show that acetylcholine is a competitive antagonist for ELIC. We determine the acetylcholine-ELIC cocrystal structure to a 2.9-{\AA} resolution and find that acetylcholine binding to an aromatic cage at the subunit interface induces a significant contraction of loop C and other structural rearrangements in the extracellular domain. The side chain of the pore-lining residue F247 reorients and the pore size consequently enlarges, but the channel remains closed. We attribute the inability of acetylcholine to activate ELIC primarily to weak cation-$\pi$ and electrostatic interactions in the pocket, because an acetylcholine derivative with a simple quaternary-to-tertiary ammonium substitution activates the channel. This study presents a compelling case for understanding the structural underpinning of the functional relationship between agonism and competitive antagonism in the Cys-loop receptors, providing a new framework for developing novel therapeutic drugs. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The recent publications of the crystal structure of an acetylcholine binding protein and a refined electron micrograph structure of the membrane-bound segment of an acetylcholine receptor have led to insights into the molecular determinants of receptor function. Although the structures confirmed much biochemical and electrophysiological data obtained about the receptors, they also provide opportunities to study further the mechanisms that allow channel activation stimulated by ligand-binding. Here we review the mechanisms of channel gating that have been elucidated by information gained from the structures of the acetylcholine binding protein and membrane-bound segment of the acetylcholine receptor.},

Vesicles contained cholesterol and phospholipid but very little ganglioside, galactolipid, free fatty acid and triglyceride was detected. Ethanolamine and choline phosphoglycerides were the dominant phospholipids. Lysophosphatidyl choline was present in very low amounts. The fatty acid composition of the phosphoglycerides was characterized by high levels of docosahexaenoic acid in the ethanolamine and serine phosphoglycerides, and the absence of long chain fatty acids from the sphingomyelins. All the characteristic features of the lipid composition of the synaptosomal plasma membrane (with the exception of the ganglioside content) were seen in the synaptic vesicle lipids.

abstract = {Model calculations were performed to explore quantitative aspects of the discocyte-echinocyte shape transformation in red blood cells. The shape transformation was assumed to be driven by changes in the preferred curvature of the membrane bilayer and opposed by the elastic shear rigidity of the membrane skeleton. The energy required for echinocyte bump formation was calculated for a range of bump shapes for different preferred curvatures. Energy minima corresponding to nonzero bump heights were found when the stress-free area difference between the membrane leaflets or the spontaneous curvature of the membrane became sufficiently large, but the calculations predict that the membrane can tolerate significant differences in the resting areas of the inner and outer leaflets or significant spontaneous curvature without visible changes in shape. Thus, if the cell is near the threshold for bump formation, the calculations predict that small changes in membrane properties would produce large changes in cellular geometry. These results provide a rational framework for interpreting observations of shape transformations in red cells and for understanding the mechanism by which small changes in membrane elastic properties might lead to significant changes in geometry.},

abstract = {Serotonin type 3 (5-HT(3)) receptors are pentameric ion channels belonging to the superfamily of Cys-loop receptors. Receptor activation either leads to fast excitatory responses or modulation of neurotransmitter release depending on their neuronal localisation. 5-HT(3) receptors are known to be expressed in the central nervous system in regions involved in the vomiting reflex, processing of pain, the reward system, cognition and anxiety control. In the periphery they are present on a variety of neurons and immune cells. 5-HT(3) receptors are known to be involved in emesis, pain disorders, drug addiction, psychiatric and GI disorders. Progress in molecular genetics gives direction to personalised medical strategies for treating complex diseases such as psychiatric and functional GI disorders and unravelling individual drug responses in pharmacogenetic approaches. Here we discuss the molecular basis of 5-HT(3) receptor diversity at the DNA and protein level, of which our knowledge has greatly extended in the last decade. We also evaluate their role in health and disease and describe specific case-control studies addressing the involvement of polymorphisms of 5-HT3 subunit genes in complex disorders and responses to drugs. Furthermore, we focus on the actual state of the pharmacological knowledge concerning not only classical 5-HT(3) antagonists--the setrons--but also compounds of various substance classes targeting 5-HT(3) receptors such as anaesthetics, opioids, cannabinoids, steroids, antidepressants and antipsychotics as well as natural compounds derived from plants. This shall point to alternative treatment options modulating the 5-HT(3) receptor system and open new possibilities for drug development in the future.},

abstract = {Emerging evidence indicates that hypnotic anesthetics affect immune function. Many anesthetics potentiate {\$}\gamma{\$}-aminobutyric acid A receptor (GABAAR) activation, and these receptors are expressed on multiple subtypes of immune cells, providing a potential mechanistic link. Like immune cells, airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells also express GABAARs, particularly isoforms containing {\$}\alpha{\$}4 subunits, and activation of these receptors leads to ASM relaxation. We sought to determine if GABAAR signaling modulates the ASM contractile and inflammatory phenotype of a murine allergic asthma model utilizing GABAAR {\$}\alpha{\$}4 subunit global knockout (KO; Gabra4(0/0)) mice. Wild type (WT) and Gabra4 KO mice were sensitized with house dust mite (HDM) antigen or exposed to phosphate buffered saline (PBS) intranasally 5 days/week for 3 weeks. Ex vivo tracheal rings from HDM-sensitized WT and Gabra4 KO mice exhibited similar magnitudes of acetylcholine-induced contractile force and isoproterenol-induced relaxation (p=n.s.; n=4). In contrast, in vivo airway resistance (flexiVent) was significantly increased in Gabra4 KO mice (p{\textless}0.05, n=8). Moreover, the Gabra4 KO mice demonstrated increased eosinophilic lung infiltration (p{\textless}0.05; n=4), and increased markers of lung T cell activation/memory (CD62L low, CD44 high; p{\textless}0.01, n=4). In vitro, Gabra4 KO CD4(+) cells produced increased cytokines and exhibited increased proliferation after stimulation of the T cell receptor as compared to WT CD4(+) cells. These data suggest that the GABAAR {\$}\alpha{\$}4 subunit plays a role in immune cell function during allergic lung sensitization. Thus, GABAAR {\$}\alpha{\$}4 subunit-specific agonists have the therapeutic potential to treat asthma via two mechanisms: direct ASM relaxation and inhibition of airway inflammation.},

Therefore, measures to prevent the manifestation, and treatments to ameliorate the symptoms, of these disorders are in high demand. Brain lipids determine the localization and function of proteins in the cell membrane of neurons. Lipids may also act as neurotransmitters or other signalling molecules. The lipid composition of the brain can be influenced by nutrition, environmental factors, and by behavioural activity. Thus, lipids represent a target for preventive medicine of psychiatric disorders. Here we review how brain lipids contribute to normal behaviour and to major psychiatric disorders with the focus on phospholipids/fatty acids, sphingolipids, and endocannabinoids. Accumulating evidence suggests a crucial role for membrane forming and signalling lipids in the brain in the etiopathologies of depression, bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, and drug addiction. Lipids also represent potential preventive interventions for these psychiatric disorders by either targeted dietary supplementation or pharmacological manipulation of lipid regulating enzymes.},

In the present study, we determined the fatty acid composition of postmortem orbitofrontal cortex (OFC, Brodmann area 10) of patients with bipolar disorder (n = 18) and age-matched normal controls (n = 19) by gas chromatography. After correction for multiple comparisons, DHA (- 24{\%}), arachidonic acid (- 14{\%}), and stearic acid (C18:0) (- 4.5{\%}) compositions were significantly lower, and cis-vaccenic acid (18:1n-7) (+ 12.5{\%}) composition significantly higher, in the OFC of bipolar patients relative to normal controls. Based on metabolite:precursor ratios, significant elevations in arachidonic acid, stearic acid, and palmitic acid conversion/metabolism were observed in the OFC of bipolar patients, and were inversely correlated with DHA composition. Deficits in OFC DHA and arachidonic acid composition, and elevations in arachidonic acid metabolism, were numerically (but not significantly) greater in drug-free bipolar patients relative to patients treated with mood-stabilizer or antipsychotic medications. OFC DHA and arachidonic acid deficits were greater in patients plus normal controls with high vs. low alcohol abuse severity. These results add to a growing body of evidence implicating omega-3 fatty acid deficiency as well as the OFC in the pathoaetiology of bipolar disorder. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Mounting evidence for PI-PKC signaling hyperactivity in the peripheral (platelets) and central (premortem and postmortem brain) tissues of patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder, coupled with evidence that PI-PKC signal transduction is down-regulated in rat brain following chronic, but not acute, treatment with antipsychotic, mood-stabilizer, and antidepressant medications, suggest that PI-PKC hyperactivity is central to an underlying pathophysiology. Evidence that membrane omega-3 fatty acids act as endogenous antagonists of the PI-PKC signal transduction pathway, coupled with evidence that omega-3 fatty acid deficiency is observed in peripheral and central tissues of patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder, support the hypothesis that omega-3 fatty acid deficiency may contribute to elevated PI-PKC activity in these illnesses.

In contrast to previous studies, we found no significant differences in the levels of PUFAs or other fatty acids in the prefrontal cortex (BA8) between patients and controls. Subanalysis by sex also showed no significant differences. No significant differences were found in any individual fatty acids between suicide and non-suicide cases. These psychiatric disorders might be characterized by very specific fatty acid compositions in certain areas of the brain, and BA8 might not be involved in abnormalities of PUFA metabolism.},

abstract = {The squid has been the most studied cephalopod, and it has served as a very useful model for investigating the events associated with nerve impulse generation and synaptic transmission. While the physiology of squid giant axons has been extensively studied, very little is known about the distribution and function of the neurotransmitters and receptors that mediate inhibitory transmission at the synapses. In this study we investigated whether {\$}\gamma{\$}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activates neurotransmitter receptors in stellate ganglia membranes. To overcome the low abundance of GABA-like mRNAs in invertebrates and the low expression of GABA in cephalopods, we used a two-electrode voltage clamp technique to determine if Xenopus laevis oocytes injected with cell membranes from squid stellate ganglia responded to GABA. Using this method, membrane patches containing proteins and ion channels from the squid's stellate ganglion were incorporated into the surface of oocytes. We demonstrated that GABA activates membrane receptors in cellular membranes isolated from squid stellate ganglia. Using the same approach, we were able to record native glutamate-evoked currents. The squid's GABA receptors showed an EC(50) of 98 {\$}\mu{\$}mol l(-1) to GABA and were inhibited by zinc (IC(50) = 356 {\$}\mu{\$}mol l(-1)). Interestingly, GABA receptors from the squid were only partially blocked by bicuculline. These results indicate that the microtransplantation of native cell membranes is useful to identify and characterize scarce membrane proteins. Moreover, our data also support the role of GABA as an ionotropic neurotransmitter in cephalopods, acting through chloride-permeable membrane receptors.},

abstract = {Synapse efficacy heavily relies on the number of neurotransmitter receptors available at a given time. In addition to the equilibrium between the biosynthetic production, exocytic delivery and recycling of receptors on the one hand, and the endocytic internalization on the other, lateral diffusion and clustering of receptors at the cell membrane play key roles in determining the amount of active receptors at the synapse. Mobile receptors traffic between reservoir compartments and the synapse by thermally driven Brownian motion, and become immobilized at the peri-synaptic region or the synapse by: (a) clustering mediated by homotropic inter-molecular receptor-receptor associations; (b) heterotropic associations with non-receptor scaffolding proteins or the subjacent cytoskeletal meshwork, leading to diffusional "trapping," and (c) protein-lipid interactions, particularly with the neutral lipid cholesterol. This review assesses the contribution of some of these mechanisms to the supramolecular organization and dynamics of the paradigm neurotransmitter receptor of muscle and neuronal cells -the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). Currently available information stemming from various complementary biophysical techniques commonly used to interrogate the dynamics of cell-surface components is critically discussed. The translational mobility of nAChRs at the cell surface differs between muscle and neuronal receptors in terms of diffusion coefficients and residence intervals at the synapse, which cover an ample range of time regimes. A peculiar feature of brain {\$}\alpha{\$}7 nAChR is its ability to spend much of its time confined peri-synaptically, vicinal to glutamatergic (excitatory) and GABAergic (inhibitory) synapses. An important function of the {\$}\alpha{\$}7 nAChR may thus be visiting the territories of other neurotransmitter receptors, differentially regulating the dynamic equilibrium between excitation and inhibition, depending on its residence time in each domain.},

abstract = {Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) are neurotransmitter-activated receptors that mediate fast synaptic transmission. In pLGICs, binding of agonist to the extracellular domain triggers a structural rearrangement that leads to the opening of an ion-conducting pore in the transmembrane domain and, in the continued presence of neurotransmitter, the channels desensitize (close). The flexible loops in each subunit that connect the extracellular binding domain (loops 2, 7, and 9) to the transmembrane channel domain (M2-M3 loop) are essential for coupling ligand binding to channel gating. Comparing the crystal structures of two bacterial pLGIC homologues, ELIC and the proton-activated GLIC, suggests channel gating is associated with rearrangements in these loops, but whether these motions accurately predict the motions in functional lipid-embedded pLGICs is unknown. Here, using site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and functional GLIC channels reconstituted into liposomes, we examined if, and how far, the loops at the ECD/TMD gating interface move during proton-dependent gating transitions from the resting to desensitized state. Loop 9 moves ∼9 {\AA}inward toward the channel lumen in response to proton-induced desensitization. Loop 9 motions were not observed when GLIC was in detergent micelles, suggesting detergent solubilization traps the protein in a nonactivatable state and lipids are required for functional gating transitions. Proton-induced desensitization immobilizes loop 2 with little change in position. Proton-induced motion of the M2-M3 loop was not observed, suggesting its conformation is nearly identical in closed and desensitized states. Our experimentally derived distance measurements of spin-labeled GLIC suggest ELIC is not a good model for the functional resting state of GLIC, and that the crystal structure of GLIC does not correspond to a desensitized state. These findings advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying pLGIC gating.},

abstract = {{\$}\gamma{\$}-Aminobutyric acid receptors (GABAARs) are vital for controlling excitability in the brain. This is emphasized by the numerous neuropsychiatric disorders that result from receptor dysfunction. A critical component of most native GABAARs is the {\$}\alpha{\$} subunit. Its transmembrane domain is the target for many modulators, including endogenous brain neurosteroids that impact anxiety, stress and depression, and for therapeutic drugs, such as general anesthetics. Understanding the basis for the modulation of GABAAR function requires high-resolution structures. Here we present the first atomic structures of a GABAAR chimera at 2.8-{\AA}resolution, including those bound with potentiating and inhibitory neurosteroids. These structures define new allosteric binding sites for these modulators that are associated with the {\$}\alpha{\$}-subunit transmembrane domain. Our findings will enable the exploitation of neurosteroids for therapeutic drug design to regulate GABAARs in neurological disorders.},

Structural and functional diversity and the broad presynaptic, postsynaptic, and nonsynaptic locations of nAChRs underlie their mainly modulatory roles throughout the mammalian brain. Presynaptic and preterminal nicotinic receptors enhance neurotransmitter release, postsynaptic nAChRs contribute a small minority of fast excitatory transmission, and nonsynaptic nAChRs modulate many neurotransmitter systems by influencing neuronal excitability. Nicotinic receptors have roles in development and synaptic plasticity, and nicotinic mechanisms participate in learning, memory, and attention.

abstract = {The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is the prototypic member of the 'Cys-loop' superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels which mediate synaptic neurotransmission, and whose other members include receptors for glycine, gamma-aminobutyric acid and serotonin. Cryo-electron microscopy has yielded a three-dimensional structure of the nAChR in its closed state. However, the exact nature and location of the channel gate remains uncertain. Although the transmembrane pore is constricted close to its center, it is not completely occluded. Rather, the pore has a central hydrophobic zone of radius about 3 A. Model calculations suggest that such a constriction may form a hydrophobic gate, preventing movement of ions through a channel. We present a detailed and quantitative simulation study of the hydrophobic gating model of the nicotinic receptor, in order to fully evaluate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that the hydrophobic constriction of the nAChR pore indeed forms a closed gate. Potential of mean force (PMF) calculations reveal that the constriction presents a barrier of height about 10 kT to the permeation of sodium ions, placing an upper bound on the closed channel conductance of 0.3 pS. Thus, a 3 A radius hydrophobic pore can form a functional barrier to the permeation of a 1 A radius Na+ ion. Using a united-atom force field for the protein instead of an all-atom one retains the qualitative features but results in differing conductances, showing that the PMF is sensitive to the detailed molecular interactions.},

abstract = {Why agonist-induced activation of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAcChoR) fails completely in the absence of cholesterol is unknown. Affinity-purified nAcChoRs from Torpedo reconstituted into 1,2-dioleoyl-sn- glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine/1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate/steroid bilayers at mole ratios of 58:12:30 were used to distinguish between three regions of the membrane where cholesterol might act: the lipid bilayer, the lipid-protein interface, or sites within the protein itself. In the bilayer, the role of fluidity has been ruled out and certain neutral lipids can substitute for cholesterol [C. Sunshine, MG. McNamee, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1191 (1994) 59-64]; therefore, we first tested the hypothesis that flip-flop of cholesterol across the membrane is important; a plausible mechanism might be the relief of mechanical bending strain induced by a conformation change that expands the two leaflets of the bilayer asymmetrically. Cholesterol analogs prevented from flipping by charged groups attached to the 3- position's hydroxyl supported channel opening, contrary to this hypothesis. The second hypothesis is that interstitial cholesterol binding sites exist deep within the nAcChoR that must be occupied for channel opening to occur. When cholesterol hemisuccinate was covalently 'tethered' to the glycerol backbone of phosphatidylcholine, channel opening was still supported. Thus, if there are functionally important cholesterol sites, they must be very close to the lipid-protein interface and might be termed periannular.},

The pore is shaped by an inner ring of 5 alpha-helices, which curve radially to create a tapering path for the ions, and an outer ring of 15 alpha-helices, which coil around each other and shield the inner ring from the lipids. The gate is a constricting hydrophobic girdle at the middle of the lipid bilayer, formed by weak interactions between neighbouring inner helices. When acetylcholine enters the ligand-binding domain, it triggers rotations of the protein chains on opposite sides of the entrance to the pore. These rotations are communicated through the inner helices, and open the pore by breaking the girdle apart.},

abstract = {The structural and functional properties of reconstituted nicotinic acetylcholine receptor membranes composed of phosphatidyl choline either with or without cholesterol and/or phosphatidic acid have been examined to test the hypothesis that receptor conformational equilibria are modulated by the physical properties of the surrounding lipid environment. Spectroscopic and chemical labeling data indicate that the receptor in phosphatidylcholine alone is stabilized in a desensitized-like state, whereas the presence of either cholesterol or phosphatidic acid favors a resting-like conformation. Membranes that effectively stabilize a resting-like state exhibit a relatively large proportion of non-hydrogen-bonded lipid ester carbonyls, suggesting a relatively tight packing of the lipid head groups and thus a well ordered membrane. Functional reconstituted membranes also exhibit gel-to-liquid crystal phase transition temperatures that are higher than those of nonfunctional reconstituted membranes composed of phosphatidylcholine alone. Significantly, incorporation of the receptor into phosphatidic acid-containing membranes leads to a dramatic increase in both the lateral packing densities and the gel-to-liquid crystal phase transition temperatures of the reconstituted lipid bilayers. These results suggest a functional link between the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and the physical properties of phosphatidic acid-containing membranes that could underlie the mechanism by which this lipid preferentially enhances receptor function.},

Linkage did not substantially alter channel amplitude or channel open-duration. Linkage at the C terminus of alpha4 prevented AChR potentiation by 17-beta-estradiol by disruption of its binding site. Assembly of AChRs from concatamers was less efficient, but function was much more efficient than that of unlinked subunits. With both linked and free subunits, greater ACh-induced currents per surface AChR were observed with the (alpha4)3(beta2)2 stoichiometry than with the (alpha4)2(beta2)3 stoichiometry. The (alpha4)3(beta2)2 stoichiometry exhibited much lower ACh sensitivity. When concatamers were expressed alone, dipentameric AChRs were formed in which the (alpha4)2(beta2)3 pentamer was linked to the (alpha4)3(beta2)2 pentamer. Dipentamers were selectively expressed on the cell surface, whereas most monopentamers with dangling subunits were retained intracellularly. Coexpression of concatamers with monomeric beta2, beta4, or alpha4 subunits resulted in monopentamers, the stoichiometry of which was determined by the free subunit added. Linkage between the C terminus of beta2 and the N terminus of alpha4 favored formation of ACh-binding sites within the concatamer, whereas linkage between the C terminus of alpha4 and the N terminus of beta2 favored formation of ACh-binding sites between concatamers. These protein-engineering studies provide insight into the structure and function of alpha4beta2 AChRs, emphasizing the functional differences between alpha4beta2 AChRs of different stoichiometries.},

A recent genome-wide association study identified a locus in the fatty acid desaturase (FADS) gene cluster conferring susceptibility to BD. In this study, we examined PUFA levels in patients with BD in relation to proinflammatory cytokines, FADS genotype, and dietary habits. We enrolled 83 patients with BD and 217 healthy controls who underwent plasma PUFA measurement. A subsample of 65 patients and 90 controls underwent plasma interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF{\$}\alpha{\$}) measurement, and three FADS single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped. Information on fish consumption was obtained by a self-reported diet history questionnaire. In comparing PUFA levels between patients and controls, significant differences were found for all 7 PUFAs tested. Specifically, n-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) level was decreased, and n-6 arachidonic acid level was increased in the patients (p {\textless}0.0001 for both). Plasma IL-6 and TNF{\$}\alpha{\$} levels were both significantly increased in the patients. Plasma EPA level was negatively correlated with IL-6 and TNF{\$}\alpha{\$} levels. The FADS genotype, which was associated with increased n-6 PUFA levels, was also associated with marked elevation in TNF{\$}\alpha{\$} levels. Less frequent fish intake was associated with low EPA and high IL-6 level. Taken together, our results provide strong evidence for altered plasma PUFA and proinflammatory cytokine levels in patients with BD. Furthermore, FADS genotype and fish consumption may contribute not only to altered PUFA levels but also to inflammation in BD.},

The aim of this work was to unravel the mechanisms by which lidocaine blocks Torpedo nicotinic receptors transplanted to Xenopus oocytes. Acetylcholine-elicited currents were reversibly blocked by lidocaine, in a concentration dependent manner. At doses lower than the IC(50) , lidocaine blocked nicotinic receptors only at negative potentials, indicating an open-channel blockade; the binding site within the channel was at about 30{\%} of the way through the electrical field across the membrane. In the presence of higher lidocaine doses, nicotinic receptors were blocked both at positive and negative potentials, acetylcholine dose-response curve shifted to the right and lidocaine pre-application, before its co-application with acetylcholine, enhanced the current inhibition, indicating all together that lidocaine also blocked resting receptors; besides, it increased the current decay rate. When lidocaine, at low doses, was co-applied with 2-(triethylammonio)-N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl) acetamide bromide, edrophonium or 1,5-bis(4-allyldimethylammoniumphenyl)pentan-3-one dibromide, which are quaternary-ammonium molecules that also blocked nicotinic receptors, there was an additive inhibitory effect, indicating that these molecules bound to different sites within the channel pore. These results prove that lidocaine blocks nicotinic receptors by several independent mechanisms and evidence the diverse and complex modulation of this receptor by structurally related molecules.},

abstract = {Although general anesthetics are known to modulate the activity of ligand-gated ion channels in the Cys-loop superfamily, there is at present neither consensus on the underlying mechanisms, nor predictive models of this modulation. Viable models need to offer quantitative assessment of the relative importance of several identified anesthetic binding sites. However, to date, precise affinity data for individual sites has been challenging to obtain by biophysical means. Here, the likely role of pore block inhibition by the general anesthetics isoflurane and propofol of the prokaryotic pentameric channel GLIC is investigated by molecular simulations. Microscopic affinities are calculated for both single and double occupancy binding of isoflurane and propofol to the GLIC pore. Computations are carried out for an open-pore conformation in which the pore is restrained to crystallographic radius, and a closed-pore conformation that results from unrestrained molecular dynamics equilibration of the structure. The GLIC pore is predicted to be blocked at the micromolar concentrations for which inhibition by isofluorane and propofol is observed experimentally. Calculated affinities suggest that pore block by propofol occurs at signifcantly lower concentrations than those for which inhibition is observed: we argue that this discrepancy may result from binding of propofol to an allosteric site recently identified by X-ray crystallography, which may cause a competing gain-of-function effect. Affinities of isoflurane and propofol to the allosteric site are also calculated, and shown to be 3 mM for isoflurane and 10 {\$}\mu{\$}M for propofol; both anesthetics have a lower affinity for the allosteric site than for the unoccupied pore.},

However, there are no clear results concerning the effects of chronic ethanol on nicotinic receptors and on behavior in rats nonselected by their preference to ethanol. A number of studies demonstrate that nnAChRs participate in a variety of functions, including memory and learning processes, neurodegeneration, and neuroprotection (Picciotto et al., 2000).

abstract = {Recently discovered bacterial homologues of eukaryotic pentameric ligand-gated ion channels, such as the Gloeobacter violaceus receptor (GLIC), are increasingly used as structural and functional models of signal transduction in the nervous system. Here we present a one-microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulation of the GLIC channel pH stimulated gating mechanism. The crystal structure of GLIC obtained at acidic pH in an open-channel form is equilibrated in a membrane environment and then instantly set to neutral pH. The simulation shows a channel closure that rapidly takes place at the level of the hydrophobic furrow and a progressively increasing quaternary twist. Two major events are captured during the simulation. They are initiated by local but large fluctuations in the pore, taking place at the top of the M2 helix, followed by a global tertiary relaxation. The two-step transition of the first subunit starts within the first 50 ns of the simulation and is followed at 450 ns by its immediate neighbor in the pentamer, which proceeds with a similar scenario. This observation suggests a possible two-step domino-like tertiary mechanism that takes place between adjacent subunits. In addition, the dynamical properties of GLIC described here offer an interpretation of the paradoxical properties of a permeable A13'F mutant whose crystal structure determined at 3.15 A shows a pore too narrow to conduct ions.},

abstract = {Calcium-permeable neurotransmitter receptors are concentrated into structurally and biochemically isolated cellular compartments to localize calcium-mediated events during neuro-transmission. The cytoplasmic membrane contains lipid microdomains called lipid rafts, which can gather into microscopically visible clusters, and thus the association of a particular protein with lipid rafts can result in its redistribution on the cell surface. The present study asks whether lipid rafts participate in the formation and maintenance of the calcium-permeable 7-subunit nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (7nAChR) clusters found in somatic spines of ciliary neurons. Lipid rafts and 7nAChR become progressively colocalized within somatic spines during synaptogenesis. To determine whether these rafts are required for the maintenance of 7nAChR aggregates, cholesterol was extracted from dissociated ciliary neurons by treatment with methyl-cyclodextrin. This treatment caused the dispersion of lipid rafts and the redistribution of 7nAChR into small clusters over the cell surface, suggesting that the integrity of lipid rafts is required to maintain the receptor clustering. However, lipid raft dispersion also caused the depolymerization of the F-actin cytoskeleton, which can also tether the receptor at specific sites. To assess whether interaction between rafts and 7nAChR is independent of F-actin filaments, the lipid raft patches were stabilized with a combination of the cholera toxin B subunit (CTX), which specifically binds to the raft component ganglioside GM1, and an antibody against CTX. The stabilized rafts were then treated with latrunculin-A to depolymerize F-actin. Under these conditions , large patches of CTX persisted and were colocalized with 7nAChR, indicating that the aggregates of receptors can be maintained independently of the underlying F-actin cytoskele-ton. Moreover, it was found that the 7nAChR is resistant to detergent extraction at 4°C and floats with the caveolin-containing lipid-rich fraction during density gradient centrifuga-tion, properties that are consistent with a direct association between the receptor and the membrane microdomains.},

abstract = {Certain types of nonpsychoactive cannabinoids can potentiate glycine receptors (GlyRs), an important target for nociceptive regulation at the spinal level. However, little is known about the potential and mechanism of glycinergic cannabinoids for chronic pain treatment. We report that systemic and intrathecal administration of cannabidiol (CBD), a major nonpsychoactive component of marijuana, and its modified derivatives significantly suppress chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain without causing apparent analgesic tolerance in rodents. The cannabinoids significantly potentiate glycine currents in dorsal horn neurons in rat spinal cord slices. The analgesic potency of 11 structurally similar cannabinoids is positively correlated with cannabinoid potentiation of the {\$}\alpha{\$}3 GlyRs. In contrast, the cannabinoid analgesia is neither correlated with their binding affinity for CB1 and CB2 receptors nor with their psychoactive side effects. NMR analysis reveals a direct interaction between CBD and S296 in the third transmembrane domain of purified {\$}\alpha{\$}3 GlyR. The cannabinoid-induced analgesic effect is absent in mice lacking the {\$}\alpha{\$}3 GlyRs. Our findings suggest that the {\$}\alpha{\$}3 GlyRs mediate glycinergic cannabinoid-induced suppression of chronic pain. These cannabinoids may represent a novel class of therapeutic agents for the treatment of chronic pain and other diseases involving GlyR dysfunction.},

abstract = {The risk of schizophrenia is increased in offspring whose mothers experience malnutrition during pregnancy. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are dietary components that are crucial for the structural and functional integrity of neural cells, and PUFA deficiency has been shown to be a risk factor for schizophrenia. Here, we show that gestational and early postnatal dietary deprivation of two PUFAs - arachidonic acid (AA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) - elicited schizophrenia-like phenotypes in mouse offspring at adulthood. In the PUFA-deprived mouse group, we observed lower motivation and higher sensitivity to a hallucinogenic drug resembling the prodromal symptoms in schizophrenia. Furthermore, a working-memory task-evoked hyper-neuronal activity in the medial prefrontal cortex was also observed, along with the downregulation of genes in the prefrontal cortex involved in oligodendrocyte integrity and the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic system. Regulation of these genes was mediated by the nuclear receptor genes Rxr and Ppar, whose promoters were hyper-methylated by the deprivation of dietary AA and DHA. In addition, the RXR agonist bexarotene upregulated oligodendrocyte- and GABA-related gene expression and suppressed the sensitivity of mice to the hallucinogenic drug. Notably, the expression of these nuclear receptor genes were also downregulated in hair-follicle cells from schizophrenia patients. These results suggest that PUFA deficiency during the early neurodevelopmental period in mice could model the prodromal state of schizophrenia through changes in the epigenetic regulation of nuclear receptor genes.},

Acyl chain saturation was lowest in phosphatidylcholine (15.4{\%}) and phosphatidylethanolamine {\{}(PE;{\}} 16.2{\%}), followed by phosphatidylserine {\{}(PS;{\}} 29.4{\%}), and highest in phosphatidylinositol (53.1{\%}). The lipid molecular species profiles of the various membranes were generally similar, with a deviation from a calculated average profile of approximately +/- 20{\%}. Nevertheless, clear distinctions between the molecular species profiles of different membranes were observed, suggesting that lipid sorting mechanisms are operating at the level of individual molecular species to maintain the specific lipid composition of a given membrane. Most notably, the plasma membrane is enriched in saturated species of {\{}PS{\}} and {\{}PE.{\}} The nature of the sorting mechanism that determines the lipid composition of the plasma membrane was investigated further. The accumulation of monounsaturated species of {\{}PS{\}} at the expense of diunsaturated species in the plasma membrane of wild-type cells was reversed in {\{}elo3Delta{\}} mutant cells, which synthesize C24 fatty acid-substituted sphingolipids instead of the normal C26 fatty acid-substituted species.

They contribute to cognition, reward, mood and nociception, and are implicated in a range of neurological disorders. Previous measurements of whole-cell macroscopic currents showed that {\$}\alpha{\$}4 and {\$}\beta{\$}2 subunits assemble in two predominant pentameric stoichiometries, which differ in their sensitivity to agonists, antagonists and allosteric modulators. Here we compare agonist-elicited single channel currents from receptors assembled with an excess of either the {\$}\alpha{\$}4 or {\$}\beta{\$}2 subunit, forming receptor populations biased toward one or the other stoichiometry, with currents from receptors composed of five concatemeric subunits in which the subunit stoichiometry is predetermined. Our results associate each subunit stoichiometry with a unique single channel conductance, mean open channel lifetime and sensitivity to the allosteric potentiator NS-9283. Receptors with the composition ({\$}\alpha{\$}4{\$}\beta{\$}2)2{\$}\alpha{\$}4 exhibit high single channel conductance, brief mean open lifetime and strong potentiation by NS-9283, whereas receptors with the composition ({\$}\alpha{\$}4{\$}\beta{\$}2)2{\$}\beta{\$}2 exhibit low single channel conductance, long mean open lifetime and are not potentiated by NS-9283. Thus single channel current measurements reveal bases for the distinct functional and pharmacological properties endowed by different stoichiometries of {\$}\alpha{\$}4 and {\$}\beta{\$}2 subunits, and establish pentameric concatemers as a means to delineate interactions between subunits that confer these properties.},

abstract = {We have used optical tweezers to study the elasticity of red cell membranes; force was applied to a bead attached to a permeabilized spherical ghost and the force-extension relation was obtained from the response of a second bead bound at a diametrically opposite position. Interruption of the skeletal network by dissociation of spectrin tetramers or extraction of the actin junctions engendered a fourfold reduction in stiffness at low applied force, but only a twofold change at larger extensions. Proteolytic scission of the ankyrin, which links the membrane skeleton to the integral membrane protein, band 3, induced a similar effect. The modified, unlike the native membranes, showed plastic relaxation under a prolonged stretch. Flaccid giant liposomes showed no measurable elasticity. Our observations indicate that the elastic character is at least as much a consequence of the attachment of spectrin as of a continuous membrane-bound network, and they offer a rationale for formation of elliptocytes in genetic conditions associated with membrane-skeletal perturbations. The theory of Parker and Winlove for elastic deformation of axisymmetric shells (accompanying paper) allows us to determine the function BH2for the spherical saponin-permeabilized ghost membranes (where B is the bending modulus and H the shear modulus); taking the literature value of 2 x 10-19Nm for B, H then emerges as 2 x 10-6Nm-1. This is an order of magnitude higher than the value reported for intact cells from micropipette aspiration. Reasons for the difference are discussed.},

abstract = {The maintenance of optimal cognitive function is a central feature of healthy aging. Impairment in brain glucose uptake is common in aging associated cognitive deterioration, but little is known of how this problem arises or whether it can be corrected or bypassed. Several aspects of the challenge to providing the brain with an adequate supply of fuel during aging seem to relate to omega-3 fatty acids. For instance, low intake of omega-3 fatty acids, especially docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is becoming increasingly associated with several forms of cognitive decline in the elderly, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Brain DHA level seems to be an important regulator of brain glucose uptake, possibly by affecting the activity of some but not all the glucose transporters. DHA synthesis from either {\$}\alpha{\$}-linolenic acid (ALA) or eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is very low in humans begging the question of whether these DHA precursors are likely to be helpful in maintaining cognition during aging. We speculate that ALA and EPA may well have useful supporting roles in maintaining brain function during aging but not by their conversion to DHA. ALA is an efficient ketogenic fatty acid, while EPA promotes fatty acid oxidation. By helping to produce ketone bodies, the effects of ALA and EPA could well be useful in strategies intended to use ketones to bypass problems of impaired glucose access to the brain during aging. Hence, it may be time to consider whether the main omega-3 fatty acids have distinct but complementary roles in brain function. {\textcopyright}2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Modulation of the GABA type A receptor (GABAAR) function by cholesterol and other steroids is documented at the functional level, yet its structural basis is largely unknown. Current data on structurally related modulators suggest that cholesterol binds to subunit interfaces between transmembrane domains of the GABAAR. We construct homology models of a human GABAAR based on the structure of the glutamate-gated chloride channel GluCl of Caenorhabditis elegans. The models show the possibility of previously unreported disulfide bridges linking the M1 and M3 transmembrane helices in the {\$}\alpha{\$} and {\$}\gamma{\$} subunits. We discuss the biological relevance of such disulfide bridges. Using our models, we investigate cholesterol binding to intersubunit cavities of the GABAAR transmembrane domain. We find that very similar binding modes are predicted independently by three approaches: analogy with ivermectin in the GluCl crystal structure, automated docking by AutoDock, and spontaneous rebinding events in unbiased molecular dynamics simulations. Taken together, the models and atomistic simulations suggest a somewhat flexible binding mode, with several possible orientations. Finally, we explore the possibility that cholesterol promotes pore opening through a wedge mechanism. {\textcopyright}2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {General anaesthetics have enjoyed long and widespread use but their molecular mechanism of action remains poorly understood. There is good evidence that their principal targets are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) such as inhibitory GABA(A) ({\$}\gamma{\$}-aminobutyric acid) receptors and excitatory nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which are respectively potentiated and inhibited by general anaesthetics. The bacterial homologue from Gloeobacter violaceus (GLIC), whose X-ray structure was recently solved, is also sensitive to clinical concentrations of general anaesthetics. Here we describe the crystal structures of the complexes propofol/GLIC and desflurane/GLIC. These reveal a common general-anaesthetic binding site, which pre-exists in the apo-structure in the upper part of the transmembrane domain of each protomer. Both molecules establish van der Waals interactions with the protein; propofol binds at the entrance of the cavity whereas the smaller, more flexible, desflurane binds deeper inside. Mutations of some amino acids lining the binding site profoundly alter the ionic response of GLIC to protons, and affect its general-anaesthetic pharmacology. Molecular dynamics simulations, performed on the wild type (WT) and two GLIC mutants, highlight differences in mobility of propofol in its binding site and help to explain these effects. These data provide a novel structural framework for the design of general anaesthetics and of allosteric modulators of brain pLGICs.},

In this work, the thermodynamic properties of mixed monolayers of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and oleic acid at the air-water interface were determined using Langmuir isotherms. The isotherm study revealed an attractive interaction between oleic acid and DPPC. The incorporation of oleic acid also monotonically decreased the elastic modulus of the monolayer indicative of higher fluidity with increasing oleic acid content. Using the surface force apparatus, intermembrane force–distance profiles were obtained for substrate supported DPPC membranes containing 30mol{\%} oleic acid at pH5.8 and 7.4. Three different preparation conditions resulted in distinct force profiles. Membranes prepared in pH5.8 subphase had a low number of nanoscopic defects ≤1{\%} and an adhesion magnitude of {\~{}}0.6mN/m. A slightly higher defect density of 1–4{\%} was found for membranes prepared in a physiological pH7.4 subphase. The presence of the exposed hydrophobic moieties resulted in a higher adhesion magnitude of 2.9mN/m. Importantly, at pH7.4, some oleic acid deprotonates resulting in a long-range electrostatic repulsion. Even though oleic acid increased the DPPC bilayer fluidity and the number of defects, no membrane restructuring was observed indicating that the system maintained a stable configuration.},

abstract = {The ionotropic 5HT(3) receptor was expressed in transiently transfected mammalian cells, yielding an unprecedented high concentration of up to 12 million receptors per cell. Receptor traffic in the plasma membrane of live cells was observed continuously over 24 h by fluorescence scanning confocal microscopy. This was possible by using 5HT(3) receptor-specific fluorescent ligands with high binding affinity and low off-rate to pulse label receptors at any time after appearance on the cell surface, and label subsequently those receptors expressed later by another, spectrally distinguishable, high-affinity fluorescent ligand. Having reached a critical cell surface concentration of approximately 3000 receptors/microm(2), the receptors started to aggregate in patches with a 4-fold increased surface concentration. The clusters were constantly delivered from a pool of freshly expressed receptors isotropically distributed within the basolateral region of the cell membrane. From there, they migrated to and accumulated on the apical cell surface approximately 9 h after transfection. Individual clusters grew until they reached a critical size of 1-2 microm when they merged to form with 3-5 microm large macroclusters. Clustered receptors were immobile on the minute time scale but always coexisted with monomeric receptors in the regions surrounding the clusters as revealed by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Because the receptor density of 12 000 receptors/microm(2) in the patches is as high as that found in two-dimensional crystals of certain membrane proteins, such patches might be a proper source for direct crystallization of membrane proteins without prior purification.},

Removal of between 60-100{\%} of high mannose moieties from the nAChR has no effect on nAChR secondary structure, stability, or flexibility. Deglycosylation does not influence either agonist binding or the ability of the nAChR to undergo agonist-induced conformational change. In contrast, nAChR structural stability, flexibility, and function are all negatively influenced by simple changes in reconstituted membrane lipid composition. Our results suggest that deglycosylation may represent a feasible approach for enhancing the crystallizability of the nAChR. Our data also demonstrate that the dependence of nAChR structural stability on lipid environment may represent a significant obstacle to nAChR crystallization. Some membrane proteins may have evolved complex interactions with their lipid environments. Understanding the complexity of these interactions may be essential for devising an appropriate strategy for the crystallization of some membrane proteins. {\textcopyright}2005 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels mediate rapid chemo-electric signal transduction in animals. The active site of this family of proteins is their ion channel pore, which is located at the center of the transmembrane domain. The opening/closing motions of the channel pore are governed by the binding of neurotransmitter to the extracellular domain, but also by allosteric effectors acting within the transmembrane domain. Here, we review the structure of the transmembrane domain as well as its role in the allosteric modulation of pentameric ligand-gated ion channel function. We focus on two examples: the interactions of nicotinic ACh receptors with lipids, for which a novel " uncoupled" state has been proposed, and the interactions of GABAA and Glycine receptors with allosteric modulators, such as general anesthetics, ethanol and neurosteroids. We revisit these data in light of the recently solved X-ray structures of bacterial members of the family, which provide atomic-resolution insight into the structures of both the transmembrane domain and associated lipids. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Summary The gating of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels is sensitive to a variety of allosteric modulators that act on structures peripheral to those involved in the allosteric pathway leading from the agonist site to the channel gate. One such structure, the lipid-exposed transmembrane {\$}\alpha{\$} helix, M4, is the target of lipids, neurosteroids, and disease-causing mutations. Here we show that M4 interactions with the adjacent transmembrane {\$}\alpha{\$} helices, M1 and M3, modulate pLGIC function. Enhanced M4 interactions promote channel function while ineffective interactions reduce channel function. The interface chemistry governs the intrinsic strength of M4-M1/M3 inter-helical interactions, both influencing channel gating and imparting distinct susceptibilities to the potentiating effects of a lipid-facing M4 congenital myasthenic syndrome mutation. Through aromatic substitutions, functional studies, and molecular dynamics simulations, we elucidate a mechanism by which M4 modulates channel function.},

abstract = {Rapsyn, a peripheral membrane protein of skeletal muscle, clusters nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) at high density in the postsynaptic membrane. The mechanism of nAChR clustering by rapsyn was analyzed by expressing nAChRs in HEK293T cells with various fragments of mouse rapsyn fused to green fluorescent protein. Membrane targeting of rapsyn is conferred solely by its acylated N terminus, as the myristoylated N-terminal 15 amino acids of rapsyn are sufficient to target green fluorescent protein to the plasma membrane. However, neither N-terminal myristoylation nor the conserved N-terminal amino acid sequence is essential. Membrane targeting, self-association, and nAChR clustering are preserved when the first 10 amino acids of rapsyn were replaced by those of src, which also contains a consensus sequence for N-myristoylation, or by those of GAP43, which contains a palmitoylation sequence. Rapsyn1-90, containing two tetratrichopeptide repeats is sufficient for self-association. Rapsyn1-360, lacking the cysteine rich domain, clusters nAChRs, while rapsyn1-287, containing seven tetratrichopeptide repeats, does not cluster nAChRs. We identified rapsyn298-331 as a potential coiled-coil domain, and established that mutations disrupting coiled-coil propensity prevent nAChR clustering. Thus the structural domains of rapsyn necessary for membrane targeting, self-association, and nAChR clustering are distinct, with nAChR-rapsyn interaction mediated by a previously unrecognized coiled-coil motif.},

abstract = {Membrane lipids are potent modulators of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) from Torpedo. Lipids influence nAChR function by both conformational selection and kinetic mechanisms, stabilizing varying proportions of activatable versus non-activatable conformations, as well as influencing the transitions between these conformational States. Of note, some membranes stabilize an electrically silent uncoupled conformation that binds agonist but does not undergo agonist-induced conformational transitions. The uncoupled nAChR, however, does transition to activatable conformations in relatively thick lipid bilayers, such as those found in lipid rafts. In this review, we discuss current understanding of lipid-nAChR interactions in the context of increasingly available high resolution structural and functional data. These data highlight different sites of lipid action, including the lipid-exposed M4 transmembrane {\$}\alpha{\$}-helix. Current evidence suggests that lipids alter nAChR function by modulating interactions between M4 and the adjacent transmembrane {\$}\alpha{\$}-helices, M1 and M3. These interactions have also been implicated in both the folding and trafficking of nAChRs to the cell surface. We review current mechanistic understanding of lipid-nAChR interactions, and highlight potential biological roles for lipid-nAChR interactions in modulating the synaptic response.

abstract = {Introduction: Testicular torsion and detorsion causes reperfusion injury which damages the testicular tissue and affects the quality of sperm. Deterioration in the quality of sperm worldwide is the recent scenario and one of its reasons is testicular ischemic/ reperfusion (IR) injury. Therefore the present study aims at producing new drugs for the treatment of testicular IR injury. Methods: 42 animals were selected for the study and divided into 7 groups, each containing 6 rats. Bioflavonoids were tested for their efficacy in reversing the damage done to the testicular tissue by causing testicular torsion and detorsion in rats. As oxidative stress produced in the above condition causes tissue damage, MDA level was measured and antioxidant enzymes SOD and catalse were evaluated. Histological examination was conducted to find the extent of damage and the protective effect of rutin and naringin. One-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc test were used for data analysis. A p-value{\textless}0.001 was considered statistically significant. Results: MDA levels increased and antioxidant enzymes decreased drastically in the group of rats with testicular torsion and detorsion which clearly indicates a rise in oxidative stress (68{\%} rise in the case of MDA and 20{\%} and 16{\%} decrease in SOD and catalase concentrations, respectively). Rutin and naringin-treated groups showed the beneficial effects of the medicinal drugs, particularly in higher doses. Rutin, 10 mg/kg, was effective when compared to naringin in providing protection. Compared to the animals in the control group, there was a 30{\%} reduction in MDA levels and a 20{\%} increment in SOD levels plus a five-fold increase in catalse in the rutin-treated group (10 mg/kg). Histological examination supported the above claims. Conclusion: Oxidative stress in testicular injury affects the quality of sperm. Rutin and naringin in higher doses protected testicular tissue effectively. Further studies in this direction may prove beneficial.},

abstract = {The metabolic syndrome is a cluster of pathological conditions, including hypertension, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, obesity and low HDL levels that is of great concern worldwide, as individuals with metabolic syndrome have an increased risk of type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Insulin resistance, the key feature of the metabolic syndrome, might be at the same time cause and consequence of impaired lipid composition in plasma membranes of insulin-sensitive tissues like liver, muscle and adipose tissue. Diet intervention has been proposed as a powerful tool to prevent the development of the metabolic syndrome, since healthy diets have been shown to have a protective role against the components of the metabolic syndrome. Particularly, dietary fatty acids are capable of modulating the deleterious effects of these conditions, among other mechanisms, by modifications of the lipid composition of the membranes in insulin-sensitive tissues. However, there is still scarce data based of high-level evidence on the effects of dietary oils on the effects of the metabolic syndrome and its components. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the effects of dietary oils on improving alterations of the components of the metabolic syndrome. It also examines their influence in the modulation of plasma membrane lipid composition and in the functionality of membrane proteins involved in insulin activity, like the insulin receptor, GLUT-4, CD36/FAT and ABCA-1, and their effect in the metabolism of glucose, fatty acids and cholesterol, and, in turn, the key features of the metabolic syndrome.

abstract = {Our molecular simulations reveal that wild-type influenza fusion peptides are able to stabilize a highly fusogenic pre-fusion structure, i.e. a peptide bundle formed by four or more trans-membrane arranged fusion peptides. We rationalize that the lipid rim around such bundle has a non-vanishing rim energy (line-tension), which is essential to (i) stabilize the initial contact point between the fusing bilayers, i.e. the stalk, and (ii) drive its subsequent evolution. Such line-tension controlled fusion event does not proceed along the hypothesized standard stalk-hemifusion pathway. In modeled influenza fusion, single point mutations in the influenza fusion peptide either completely inhibit fusion (mutants G1V and W14A) or, intriguingly, specifically arrest fusion at a hemifusion state (mutant G1S). Our simulations demonstrate that, within a line-tension controlled fusion mechanism, these known point mutations either completely inhibit fusion by impairing the peptide's ability to stabilize the required peptide bundle (G1V and W14A) or stabilize a persistent bundle that leads to a kinetically trapped hemifusion state (G1S). In addition, our results further suggest that the recently discovered leaky fusion mutant G13A, which is known to facilitate a pronounced leakage of the target membrane prior to lipid mixing, reduces the membrane integrity by forming a 'super' bundle. Our simulations offer a new interpretation for a number of experimentally observed features of the fusion reaction mediated by the prototypical fusion protein, influenza hemagglutinin, and might bring new insights into mechanisms of other viral fusion reactions.},

abstract = {The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) is in intimate contact with the lipids in its native membrane. Here we analyze the possibility that it is the intrinsic properties of the AChR that determine its partition into a given lipid domain. Torpedo AChR or a synthetic peptide corresponding to the AChR M4 segment (the one in closer contact with lipids) was reconstituted into "raft"-containing model membranes. The distribution of the AChR was assessed by Triton X-100 extraction in combination with fluorescence studies, and lipid analyses were performed on each sample. The influence of rapsyn, a peripheral protein involved in AChR aggregation, was studied. Raft-like domain aggregation was also studied using membranes containing the ganglioside GM1 followed by GM1 crosslinking. The gammaM4 peptide displays a marked preference for raft-like domains. In contrast, AChR alone or in the presence of rapsyn or ganglioside aggregation exhibits no such preference for raft-like domains, but it does cause a significant reduction in the total amount of these domains. The results indicate that the distribution of the AChR in lipid domains cannot be due exclusively to the intrinsic physicochemical properties of the protein and that there must be an external signal in native cell membranes that directs the AChR to a specific membrane domain.},

We determined a 3.25 {\AA}crystal structure of the GLIC-DHA complex in a potentially desensitized conformation. The DHA molecule is bound at the channel-periphery near the M4 helix and exerts a long-range allosteric effect on the pore across domain-interfaces. In this previously unobserved conformation, the extracellular-half of the pore-lining M2 is splayed open, reminiscent of the open conformation, while the intracellular-half is constricted, leading to a loss of both water and permeant ions. These findings, in combination with spin-labeling/EPR spectroscopic measurements in reconstituted-membranes, provide novel mechanistic details of desensitization in pentameric channels.},

The determined affinity constants indicate a weak interaction of three test compounds (Ki in the micromolar range) with both receptors, but no interaction could be recorded with the other three test compounds.

abstract = {With the long-term goal of using a chimeric approach to dissect the distinct lipid sensitivities and thermal stabilities of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGIC), GLIC and ELIC, we constructed chimeras by cross-combining their extracellular (ECD) and transmembrane (TMD) domains. As expected, the chimera formed between GLIC-ECD and ELIC-TMD (GE) responded to protons, the agonist for GLIC, but not cysteamine, the agonist for ELIC, although GE exhibited a 25-fold decrease in proton-sensitivity relative to wild type. The chimera formed between ELIC-ECD and the GLIC-TMD (EG) was usually toxic, unless it contained a pore-lining Ile9′Ala gain-of-function mutation. No significant improvements in expression/toxicity were observed with extensive loop substitutions at the ECD/TMD interface. Surprisingly, oocytes expressing EG-I9′A responded to both the ELIC agonist, cysteamine and the GLIC agonist, protons – the latter at pH values ≤ 4.0. The cysteamine- and proton-induced currents in EG-I9′A were inhibited by the GLIC TMD pore blocker, amantadine. The cysteamine-induced response of EG-I9′A was also inhibited by protons at pH values down to 4.5, but potentiated at lower pH values. Proton-induced gating at low pH was not abolished by mutation of an intramembrane histidine residue previously implicated in GLIC TMD function. We show that the TMD plays a major role governing the thermal stability of a pLGIC, and identify three distinct mechanisms by which agonists and protons influence the gating of the EG chimera.

abstract = {The interaction of general anesthetics at the lipid/protein interface of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor reconstituted in dioleoylphosphatidylcholine bilayers at various lipid/protein ratios has been studied using the electron spin resonance spectra of phosphatidylcholine spin-labeled at the fourtheenth acyl carbon (14-PCSL). In addition to the bilayer spectrum, the spin label reported a more motionally restricted environment whose contribution increased with increasing protein/lipid ratio. Exchange between thses two environments occurred at a rate of approx. 6 {\textperiodcentered}107s-1. The motionally restricted, protein-associated 14-PCSL had a rotational correlation time of about 10-20 ns, an order of magnitude slower than when in the bilayer. Addition of 1-hexanol (up to 16 mM) to the reconstituted receptor perturbed the acyl chains of the bulk lipid phase, but the motional properties of the lipid acyl chains at the protein/lipid interface near the membrane center were not significantly perturbed on the EPR motional time-scale. Similarly, anesthetics that were less effective at perturbing the bilayer, such as pentobarbital (up to 2 mM) and isoflurane (7 mM), did not perturb the lipid/protein interface on the conventional EPR motional time scale. {\textcopyright}1993.},

  abstract = {The effects of cholesterol (Chol) and an anionic lipid, dioleoylphosphatidic acid (DOPA) on the conformational equilibria of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) have been investigated using Fourier trans- form infrared difference spectroscopy. The difference between spectra recorded in the presence and absence of agonist from the nAChR reconstituted into 3:1:1 egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC)/DOPA/Chol membranes exhibits positive and negative bands that serve as markers of the structural changes associated with the resting to desensitized conformational change. These markers are absent in similar difference spectra recorded from the nAChR reconstituted into EPC membranes lacking both Chol and DOPA, indicating that the nAChR cannot un- dergo conformational change in response to agonist binding. When low levels of either Chol or DOPA up to 25 mol {\%} of the total lipid are included in the EPC membranes, the markers suggest the predominant stabilization of a conformation that is a structural intermediate between the resting and desensitized states. At higher levels of either Chol or DOPA, the nAChR is stabilized in a conformation that is capable of undergoing agonist-induced desensitization, although DOPA appears to be required for the nAChR to adopt a conformation fully equivalent to that found in native and 3:1:1 EPC/DOPA/ Chol membranes. The ability of these two structurally diverse lipids, as well as others (Ryan, S. E., Demers, C. N., Chew, J. P., Baenziger, J. E. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 24590 –24597), to modulate the functional state of the nAChR suggests that lipids act on the nAChR via an indirect effect on some physical property of the lipid bilayer. The data also suggest that anionic lipids are essential to stabilize a fully functional nAChR. We propose that membrane fluidity modulates the relative pop- ulations of nAChRs in the resting and desensitized states but that subtle structural changes in the presence of anionic lipids are essential for full activity.},

We examine this issue by way of the model protein Gloeobacter violaceous ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC) using computational molecular dynamics, with a coarse-grained model to enhance sampling. We find that in flooding simulations, both propofol and a generic particle localize to the crystallographic transmembrane anesthetic binding region, and that propofol also localizes to an extracellular region shared with the crystallographic ketamine binding site. Subsequent simulations to probe these binding modes in greater detail demonstrate that ligand binding induces structural asymmetry in GLIC. Consequently, we employ residue interaction correlation analysis to describe the internal allosteric network underlying the coupling of ligand and distant effector sites necessary for conformational change. Overall, the results suggest that the same allosteric network may underlie the actions of various anesthetics, regardless of binding site.},

Little data exist from treatment-naive patients making it difficult to differentiate any genetic contribution associated with a diagnosis of schizophrenia from the lifestyle risks associated with this diagnosis. Additional potential risks associated with antipsychotic drug treatment have been noted in the literature since 1971. The majority of the existing data on lipids derive from retrospective and cross-sectional analyses of datasets that have been designed for other purposes. Specifically screening bias for lipid testing and treatment selection bias are important potential confounders. Prospective clinical trials are difficult to interpret, as many are short-term, report on non-fasting data and were never designed to evaluate the differential effects of antipsychotic drugs on lipids as a primary endpoint. There is little reported data on lipid fractions such as LDL and HDL. Nevertheless there is some evidence from placebo-controlled studies that antipsychotics may be differentially associated with a small, clinically insignificant increase in cholesterol and a larger, potentially clinically significant increase in triglycerides. Further prospective randomized trials, using fasting data and controlling for established risk factors such as diet and exercise are essential to determine if there are clinically meaningful differential effects on lipids associated with individual antipsychotic drugs. {\textcopyright}2005 British Association for Psychopharmacology.},

abstract = {The glycine receptor belongs to the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily. It is a chloride conducting channel composed of four transmembrane domains. It was previously shown that the second transmembrane domain (M2) of the glycine receptor forms an ion conduction pathway throught lipid bilayers. The amino-acid sequence of the transmembrane segment M2 of the glycine receptor has a high homology to all receptors of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily. In our report, we have used a synthetic M2 peptide. It was incorporated into a planar membrane of known lipid composition and currents induced by M2 were measured by the Black Lipid Membrane technique. When the planar lipid bilayer was composed of 75{\%} phosphatidylethanolamine and 25{\%} phosphatidylserine, the reversal potential measured in a 150/600 mM KCl (cis/trans) gradient was -19 mV suggesting that the examined pore was preferential to anions, P K /P Cl = 0.25. In contrast, when 75{\%} phosphatidylserine and 25{\%} phosphatidylethanolamine was used, the reversal potential was +20 mV and the pore was preferential to cations, P K /P Cl = 4.36. Single-channel currents were recorded with two predominant amplitudes corresponding to the main-conductance and sub-conductance states. Both conductance states (about 12 pS and 30 pS) were measured in a symmetric solution of 50 mM KCl. The observed single-channel properties suggest that the selectivity and conductance of the pore formed by the M2 peptide of the glycine receptor depend on the lipid composition of the planar bilayer.},

abstract = {Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (n ACh Rs) are members of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel superfamily that play important roles in the control of neurotransmitter release in the central and peripheral nervous system. These receptors are important therapeutic targets for the development of drugs against a number of mental health disorders and for marketed smoking cessation aids. Unfortunately, drug discovery has been hampered by difficulties in obtaining sufficiently selective compounds. Together with functional complexity of the receptors, this has made it difficult to obtain drugs with sufficiently high-target to off-target affinity ratios. The recent and ongoing progress in structural studies holds promise to help understand structure-function relationships of n ACh R drugs at the atomic level. This will undoubtedly lead to the design of more efficient drugs with fewer side effects. As a high-resolution structure of a n ACh R is yet to be determined, structural studies are to a large extent based on acetylcholine-binding proteins ( ACh BPs) that despite low overall sequence identity display a high degree of conservation of overall structure and amino acids at the ligand-binding site. Further, ACh BPs reproduce relative binding affinities of ligands at n ACh Rs. Over the past decade, ACh BPs have been used extensively as models for n ACh Rs and have aided the understanding of drug receptor interactions at n ACh Rs significantly. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Background. Accumulation of free fatty acids leads to lipid-toxicity-associated skeletal muscle atrophy. Palmitate treatment reduces myoblast and myotube growth and causes apoptosis in vitro. It is not known if omega-3 fatty acids will protect muscle cells against palmitate toxicity. Therefore, we examined the effects of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on skeletal muscle growth. Methods. Mouse myoblasts (C 2 C 12) were differentiated to myotubes, and then treated with 0 or 0.5 mM palmitic acid or 0 or 0.1 mM DHA. Results. Intramyocellular lipid was increased in palmitate-treated cells but was prevented by DHA-palmitate cotreatment. Total AMPK increased in DHA+ palmitate-treated compared to palmitate only cells. RpS6 phosphorylation decreased after palmitate (−55{\%}) and this was blunted by DHA+ palmitate (−35{\%}) treatment. Palmitate treatment decreased PGC1{\$}\alpha{\$} protein expression by 69{\%}, but was increased 165{\%} with DHA+ palmitate (P = 0.017) versus palmitate alone. While palmitate induced 25{\%} and 90{\%} atrophy in myotubes (after 48 hours and 96 hours, resp.), DHA+ palmitate treatment caused myotube hypertrophy of ∼50{\%} and 100{\%} after 48 and 96 hours, respectively. Conclusion. These data show that DHA is protective against palmitate-induced atrophy. Although DHA did not activate the AMPK pathway, DHA treatment restored growth-signaling (i.e., rpS6) and rescued palmitate-induced muscle atrophy.},

As a result of research during the past several decades, a group of ligand-gated ion channels have emerged as plausible targets for general anesthetics. Molecular biology techniques have greatly accelerated attempts to classify ligand-gated ion channel sensitivity to general anesthetics, and have identified the sites of receptor subunits critical for anesthetic modulation using chimeric and mutated receptors. The experimental data have facilitated the construction of tenable molecular models for anesthetic binding sites, which in turn allows structural predictions to be tested. In vivo significance of a putative anesthetic target can now be examined by targeted gene manipulations in mice. In this review, we summarize from a molecular perspective recent advances in our understanding of mechanisms of action of general anesthetics on ligand-gated ion channels.},

abstract = {In the present research, we have established a new lipidomics approach for the comprehensive and precise identification of molecular species in a crude lipid mixture using a LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer (MS) and reverse-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) combination with our newly developed lipid search engine " Lipid Search" LTQ Orbitrap provides high mass accuracy MS spectra by Fourier-transform (FT) mass spectrometer mode and can perform rapid MSn by ion trap (IT) mass spectrometer mode. In this study, the negative ion mode was selected to detect fragment ions from phospholipids, such as fatty acid anions, by MS2 or MS3. We selected the specific detection approach by neutral loss survey-dependent MS3, for the identification of molecular species of phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin and phosphatidylserine. Identification of molecular species was performed by using both the high mass accuracy of the mass spectrometric data obtained from FT mode and structural data obtained from fragments in IT mode. Some alkylacyl and alkenylacyl species have the same m/z value as molecular-related ions and fragment ions, thus, direct acid hydrolysis analysis was performed to identify alkylacyl and alkenylacyl species, and then the RPLC-LTQ Orbitrap method was applied. As a result, 290 species from mouse liver and 248 species from mouse brain were identified within six different classes of phospholipid, only those in manually detected and confirmed. Most of all manually detected mass peaks were also automatically detected by " Lipid Search" Adding to differences in molecular species in different classes of phospholipids, many characteristic differences in molecular species were detected in mouse liver and brain. More variable number of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid-containing molecular species were detected in mouse brain than liver. {\textcopyright}2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Mechanistic insights into the structure, function, and receptor interaction of alpha-conotoxins may serve as a platform for development of new therapies. Previously characterized alpha-conotoxins have a highly conserved Ser-Xaa-Pro motif that is crucial for potent nAChR interaction. This study characterized the novel alpha-conotoxin LtIA, which lacks this highly conserved motif but potently blocked alpha3beta2 nAChRs with a 9.8 nm IC(50) value. The off-rate of LtIA was rapid relative to Ser-Xaa-Pro-containing alpha-conotoxin MII. Nevertheless, pre-block of alpha3beta2 nAChRs with LtIA prevented the slowly reversible block associated with MII, suggesting overlap in their binding sites. nAChR beta subunit ligand-binding interface mutations were used to examine the {\textgreater}1000-fold selectivity difference of LtIA for alpha3beta2 versus alpha3beta4 nAChRs. Unlike MII, LtIA had a {\textgreater}900-fold increased IC(50) value on alpha3beta2(F119Q) versus wild type nAChRs, whereas T59K and V111I beta2 mutants had little effect. Molecular docking simulations suggested that LtIA had a surprisingly shallow binding site on the alpha3beta2 nAChR that includes beta2 Lys-79. The K79A mutant disrupted LtIA binding but was without effect on an LtIA analog where the Ser-Xaa-Pro motif is present, consistent with distinct binding modes.},

Because the members of the superfamily are all receptors, it is reasonable to suppose that their common ancestor must also have been some type of receptor, and because the receptors are made of similar subunits, the ancestor was probably homo-oligomeric. Although we failed to find a group of proteins that are related evolutionarily to this superfamily, the analysis of the evolutionary relationships within the superfamily is possible and can give rise to information about the evolution of the structure and function of present-day receptors and indeed of the nervous system itself. {\textcopyright}1995.},

abstract = {Protein-lipid interactions were studied by using Torpedo californica acetylcholine receptor (AChR) as a model system by reconstituting purified AChR into membranes containing various synthetic lipids and native lipids. AChR function was determined by measuring 2 activities at 4.degree.: (1) low to high agonist affinity-state transition of AChR in the presence of an agonist (carbamylcholine [462-58-8]) in either membrane fragments or sealed vesicles and (2) ion-gating activity of AChR-containing vesicles in response to carbamylcholine. Sixteen samples were examined, each containing different lipid compns. including phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol [57-88-5], phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylethanolamine, asolectin, neutral lipid-depleted asolectin, native lipids, and cholesterol-depleted native lipids. Phosphatidylcholines with different configurations of fatty acyl chains were used. The dynamic structures of these membranes were probed by incorporating spin-labeled fatty acid into AChR-containing vesicles and measuring the order parameters. Both aspects of AChR function were highly dependent on the lipid environment even though carbamylcholine binding itself was not affected. An appropriate membrane fluidity was necessarily required to allow the interconversion between the low- and high-affinity states of AChR. An optimal fluidity hypothesis is proposed to account for the conformational transition properties of membrane proteins. In addition, the conformational change was only a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the AChR-mediated ion flux activity. Among membranes in which AChR manifested the affinity-state transition, only those containing both cholesterol and neg. charged phospholipids (such as phosphatidic acid) retained the ion-gating activity.},

abstract = {Rationale: The non-selective nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist nicotine has been argued to improve attention via enhanced filtering of irrelevant stimuli. Here, we tested this hypothesis in the context of smooth pursuit eye movements (SPEMs), an oculomotor function previously shown to improve with nicotine in some but not all studies. Objectives: In order to test whether nicotine improves performance particularly when the inhibition of distracting stimuli is required, SPEM was elicited in conditions with or without peripheral distractors. Additionally, different target frequencies were employed in order to parametrically vary general processing demands on the SPEM system. Methods: Healthy adult non-smokers (N = 18 females, N = 13 males) completed a horizontal sinusoidal SPEM task at different target frequencies (0.2 Hz, 0.4 Hz, 0.6 Hz) in the presence or absence of peripheral distractors in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design using a 2 mg nicotine gum. Results: Nicotine increased peak pursuit gain relative to placebo (p {\textless}.001), but an interaction with distractor condition (p =.001) indicated that this effect was most pronounced in the presence of distractors. Catch-up saccade frequency was reduced by nicotine (p =.01), particularly at higher target frequencies (two-way interaction, p =.04). However, a three-way interaction (p =.006) indicated that the reduction with nicotine was strongest at the highest target frequency (0.6 Hz) only without distractors, whereas in the presence of distractors, it was strongest at 0.4-Hz target frequency. There were no effects of nicotine on subjective state measures. Conclusions: Together, these findings support a role of both distractor inhibition and general processing load in the effects of nicotine on smooth pursuit.},

The homologous prokaryotic pentameric ligand-gated ion channel, Gloebacter ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC), represents an excellent model for probing the molecular basis of nAChR sensitivity because of its high structural homology, relative ease of expression, and amenability to crystallographic analysis. We show here that membrane-reconstituted GLIC exhibits structural and biophysical properties similar to those of the membrane-reconstituted nAChR, although GLIC is substantially more thermally stable. GLIC, however, does not possess the same exquisite lipid sensitivity. In particular, GLIC does not exhibit the same propensity to adopt an uncoupled conformation where agonist binding is uncoupled from channel gating. Structural comparisons provide insight into the chemical features that may predispose the nAChR to the formation of an uncoupled state.},

abstract = {The {\$}\alpha{\$}7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) play an important role in cellular events such as neurotransmitter release, second messenger cascades, cell survival and apoptosis. In addition, they are a therapeutic target for the treatment of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, and drugs that potentiate {\$}\alpha{\$}7 nAChRs through the regulation of desensitization are currently being developed. Recently, these channels were found to be localized into lipid rafts. Here we show that the disruption of lipid rafts in rat primary hippocampal neurons, through cholesterol-scavenging drugs (methyl-{\$}\beta{\$}-cyclodextrin) and the enzymatic breakdown of sphingomyelin (sphingomyelinase), results in significant changes in the desensitization kinetics of native and expressed {\$}\alpha{\$}7 nAChRs. These effects can be prevented by cotreatment with cholesterol and sphingomyelin, and can be mimicked by treatment with cholesterol and sphingomyelin synthesis inhibitors (mevastatin and myriocin, respectively), suggesting that the effects on desensitization kinetics are indeed due to changes in the levels of cholesterol and sphingomyelin in the plasma membrane. These data provide new insights into themechanism of desensitization of {\$}\alpha{\$}7 nAChRs by providing evidence that the lipid composition of the plasma membrane can modulate the activity of the {\$}\alpha{\$}7 nAChRs.},

abstract = {The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) is the archetype molecule in the superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels (LGIC). Members of this superfamily mediate fast intercellular communication in response to endogenous neurotransmitters. This review is focused on the structural and functional crosstalk between the AChR and lipids in the membrane microenvironment, and the modulation exerted by the latter on ligand binding and ion translocation. Experimental approaches using Laurdan extrinsic fluorescence and F{\"{o}}rster-type resonance energy transfer (FRET) that led to the characterization of the polarity and molecular dynamics of the liquid-ordered phase AChR-vicinal lipids and the bulk membrane lipids, and the asymmetry of the AChR-rich membrane are reviewed first. The topological relationship between protein and lipid moieties and the changes in physical properties induced by exogenous lipids are discussed next. This background information lays the basis for understanding the occurrence of lipid sites in the AChR transmembrane region, and the selectivity of the protein-lipid interactions. Changes in FRET efficiency induced by fatty acids, phospholipid and cholesterol (Chol), led to the identification of discrete sites for these lipids on the AChR protein, and electron-spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy has recently facilitated determination of the stoichiometry and selectivity for the AChR of the shell lipid. The influence of lipids on AChR function is discussed next. Combined single-channel and site-directed mutagenesis data fostered the recognition of lipid-sensitive residues in the transmembrane region, dissecting their contribution to ligand binding and channel gating, opening and closing. Experimental evidence supports the notion that the interface between the protein moiety and the adjacent lipid shell is the locus of a variety of pharmacologically relevant processes, including the action of steroids and other lipids. {\textcopyright}2004 Elsevier B.V.

However, neither the detailed, comprehensive compositions of individual PM leaflets nor how these contribute to structural membrane asymmetries have been defined. We report the distinct lipidomes and biophysical properties of both monolayers in living mammalian PMs. Phospholipid unsaturation is dramatically asymmetric, with the cytoplasmic leaflet being approximately twofold more unsaturated than the exoplasmic leaflet. Atomistic simulations and spectroscopy of leaflet-selective fluorescent probes reveal that the outer PM leaflet is more packed and less diffusive than the inner leaflet, with this biophysical asymmetry maintained in the endocytic system. The structural asymmetry of the PM is reflected in the asymmetric structures of protein transmembrane domains. These structural asymmetries are conserved throughout Eukaryota, suggesting fundamental cellular design principles. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].},

abstract = {Direct structural insight into the mechanisms underlying activation and desensitization remain unavailable for the pentameric ligand-gated channel family. Here, we report the structural rearrangements underlying gating transitions in membrane-embedded GLIC, a prokaryotic homologue, using site-directed spin labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. We particularly probed the conformation of pore-lining second transmembrane segment (M2) under conditions that favor the closed and the ligand-bound desensitized states. The spin label mobility, intersubunit spin-spin proximity, and the solvent-accessibility parameters in the two states clearly delineate the underlying protein motions within M2. Our results show that during activation the extracellular hydrophobic region undergoes major changes involving an outward translational movement, away from the pore axis, leading to an increase in the pore diameter, whereas the lower end of M2 remains relatively immobile. Most notably, during desensitization, the intervening polar residues in the middle of M2 move closer to form a solvent-occluded barrier and thereby reveal the location of a distinct desensitization gate. In comparison with the crystal structure of GLIC, the structural dynamics of the channel in a membrane environment suggest a more loosely packed conformation with water-accessible intrasubunit vestibules penetrating from the extracellular end all the way to the middle of M2 in the closed state. These regions have been implicated to play a major role in alcohol and drug modulation. Overall, these findings represent a key step toward understanding the fundamentals of gating mechanisms in this class of channels.},

 abstract = {Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by degeneration of motoneurons and skeletal muscle atrophy. In its most severe form, it leads to death before the age of 2 years. While primary degeneration of motor neurons is well established in this disease, and this results in neurogenic atrophy of skeletal muscle, we have previously reported evidence for a primary muscle defect. In this study, we used primary cultures of embryonic human skeletal muscle cells from patients with SMA and from controls to examine the effects of muscle fiber differentiation in the absence of a nerve component. Cultured SMA skeletal muscle cells are unable to fuse correctly to form multinuclear myotubes, the precursors of the myofibers. We also show that agrin-induced aggregates of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, one of the earliest steps of neuromuscular junction formation, cannot be visualized by confocal microscopy on cells from SMA patients. In binding experiments, we demonstrate that this lack of clustering is due to defective expression of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the myotubes of SMA patients whereas the affinity of alpha-bungarotoxin for its receptor remains unchanged regardless of muscle cell type (SMA or control). These observations suggest that muscle cells from SMA patients have intrinsic abnormalities that may affect proper formation of the neuromuscular junction.},

  abstract = {Epidemiological studies have identified a negative correlation between smoking and the development of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, and in some studies, Alzheimer's disease. These findings have been attributed to the ability of nicotine to act as a neuroprotective agent. A large number of studies demonstrate that nicotine can protect against neuronal death in vitro and in vivo, and the mechanisms underlying the ability of nicotine to protect against excitotoxicity and amyloid-? toxicity are beginning to be elucidated. Despite the compelling evidence that nicotine is neuroprotective, it is clear that nicotine can be toxic under some circumstances. The balance between nicotine neuroprotection and toxicity depends on dose, developmental stage and regimen of administration. Therefore, a full understanding of the molecular and cellular effects of nicotine on signaling pathways relevant to neuronal survival is critical for informed drug discovery of nicotinic compounds to combat human neurodegeneration. This review summarizes recent studies related to the mechanisms underlying nicotine-mediated neuroprotection, and addresses issues that are relevant to use of nicotine as a neuroprotective agent in vivo.},

We report the X-ray crystal structures of ELIC in complex with chlorpromazine or its brominated derivative bromopromazine. Unexpectedly, we do not find a chlorpromazine molecule in the channel pore of ELIC, but behind the {\$}\beta{\$}8-{\$}\beta{\$}9 loop in the extracellular ligand-binding domain. The {\$}\beta{\$}8-{\$}\beta{\$}9 loop is localized downstream from the neurotransmitter binding site and plays an important role in coupling of ligand binding to channel opening. In combination with electrophysiological recordings from ELIC cysteine mutants and a thiol-reactive derivative of chlorpromazine, we demonstrate that chlorpromazine binding at the {\$}\beta{\$}8-{\$}\beta{\$}9 loop is responsible for receptor inhibition. We further use molecular-dynamics simulations to support the X-ray data and mutagenesis experiments. Together, these data unveil an allosteric binding site in the extracellular ligand-binding domain of ELIC. Our results extend on previous observations and further substantiate our understanding of a multisite model for allosteric modulation of Cys-loop receptors.},

abstract = {Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are integral membrane proteins and prototypic members of the ligand-gated ion-channel superfamily, which has precursors in the prokaryotic world. They are formed by the assembly of five transmembrane subunits, selected from a pool of 17 homologous polypeptides (alpha1-10, beta1-4, gamma, delta, and epsilon). There are many nAChR subtypes, each consisting of a specific combination of subunits, which mediate diverse physiological functions. They are widely expressed in the central nervous system, while, in the periphery, they mediate synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction and ganglia. nAChRs are also found in non-neuronal/nonmuscle cells (keratinocytes, epithelia, macrophages, etc.). Extensive research has determined the specific function of several nAChR subtypes. nAChRs are now important therapeutic targets for various diseases, including myasthenia gravis, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and schizophrenia, as well as for the cessation of smoking. However, knowledge is still incomplete, largely because of a lack of high-resolution X-ray structures for these molecules. Nevertheless, electron microscopy studies on 2D crystals of nAChR from fish electric organs and the determination of the high-resolution X-ray structure of the acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP) from snails, a homolog of the extracellular domain of the nAChR, have been major steps forward and the data obtained have important implications for the design of subtype-specific drugs. Here, we review some of the latest advances in our understanding of nAChRs and their involvement in physiology and pathology.},

The complex effects of neurosteroids on pLGICs suggest the presence of multiple binding sites in these receptors. Here, using a series of novel neurosteroid-photolabeling reagents combined with top-down and middle-down mass spectrometry, we have determined the stoichiometry, sites, and orientation of binding for 3{\$}\alpha{\$},5{\$}\alpha{\$}-pregnane neurosteroids in the Gloeobacter ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC), a prototypic pLGIC. The neurosteroid-based reagents photolabeled two sites per GLIC subunit, both within the transmembrane domain; one site was an intrasubunit site, and the other was located in the interface between subunits. By using reagents with photoreactive groups positioned throughout the neurosteroid backbone, we precisely map the orientation of neurosteroid binding within each site. Amino acid substitutions introduced at either site altered neurosteroid modulation of GLIC channel activity, demonstrating the functional role of both sites. These results provide a detailed molecular model of multisite neurosteroid modulation of GLIC, which may be applicable to other mammalian pLGICs.},

abstract = {Endocytosis of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) is a proposed major mechanism of neuromodulation at neuromuscular junctions and in the pathology of synapses in the central nervous system. We show that binding of the competitive antagonist $\alpha$-bungaro-toxin ($\alpha$BTX) or antibody-mediated cross-linking induces the internalization of cell surface AChR to late endosomes when expressed heterologously in Chinese hamster ovary cells or endogenously in C2C12 myocytes. Internalization occurs via sequestration of AChR-$\alpha$BTX complexes in narrow, tubular, surface-connected compartments, which are indicated by differential surface accessibility of fluorescently tagged $\alpha$BTX-AChR complexes to small and large molecules and real-time total internal reflection fluorescence imaging. Internalization occurs in the absence of clathrin, caveolin, or dynamin but requires actin polymerization. $\alpha$BTX binding triggers c-Src phosphorylation and subsequently activates the Rho guanosine triphosphatase Rac1. Consequently, inhibition of c-Src kinase activity, Rac1 activity, or actin polymerization inhibits internalization via this unusual endocytic mechanism. This pathway may regulate AChR levels at ligand-gated synapses and in pathological conditions such as the autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis. {\textcopyright} 2008 Kumari et al.

Recent advances in molecular genetics have revealed clinico-genetic heterogeneity of these disorders including their clinical and genetic overlap with other diseases of the nervous system. The systematic analysis of a large set of genes, including exome sequencing, is unmasking unusual phenotypes or inheritance modes associated with mutations in HSP genes and related genes involved in various neurological diseases. A new nosology may emerge after integration and understanding of these new data to replace the current classification. Collectively, functions of the known genes implicate the disturbance of intracellular membrane dynamics and trafficking as the consequence of alterations of cytoskeletal dynamics, lipid metabolism and organelle structures, which represent in fact a relatively small number of cellular processes that could help to find common curative approaches, which are still lacking.},

Phospholipases A2 (PLA2) are key-enzymes in AA metabolism and are activated during monoaminergic neurotransmission. Reduced membrane AA levels, and an altered activity of PLA2 have been found in peripheral membranes of drug-na{\"{i}}ve patients with schizophrenia with some conflicting results in more chronic patient populations. Furthermore, in vivo brain phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy suggests reduced lipid membrane precursors (phosphomonoesters) and increased membrane breakdown products (phosphodiesters) in drug-naive or early treated first-episode schizophrenia patients compared to age-matched controls or chronic populations and these changes were correlated with peripheral red blood cell membrane AA levels. We postulate that processes modulating membrane lipid metabolism are associated with psychotic illnesses and might partially explain the mechanism of action of antipsychotic agents, as well as experimental agents such as purified ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid (E-EPA). Recent supplementation trials suggest that E-EPA is a modestly effective augmentation treatment resulting in reduced doses of antipsychotic medication in acutely ill patients with schizophrenia (but not in residual-type schizophrenia).

Rapsyn plays a central role in directing and clustering nAChR during cellular differentiation and neuromuscular junction formation; however, it has not been demonstrated whether rapsyn is the only cause of receptor immobilization. Here, we used single-molecule tracking methods to investigate nAChR mobility in plasma membranes of myoblast cells during their differentiation to myotubes in the presence and absence of rapsyn. We found that in myoblasts the majority of nAChR were immobile and that ∼20{\%} of the receptors showed restricted diffusion in small domains of ∼50 nm. In myoblasts devoid of rapsyn, the fraction of mobile nAChR was considerably increased, accompanied by a 3-fold decrease in the immobile population of nAChR with respect to rapsyn-expressing cells. Half of the mobile receptors were confined to domains of ∼120 nm. Measurements performed in heterologously transfected HEK cells confirmed the direct immobilization of nAChR by rapsyn. However, irrespective of the presence of rapsyn, about one-third of nAChR were confined in 300-nm domains. Our results show (i) that rapsyn efficiently immobilizes nAChR independently of other postsynaptic scaffold components; (ii) nAChR is constrained in confined membrane domains independently of rapsyn; and (iii) in the presence of rapsyn, the size of these domains is strongly reduced.},

abstract = {Lipids not only constitute the primary component of cellular membranes and contribute to metabolism but also serve as intracellular signaling molecules and bind to specific membrane receptors to control cell proliferation, growth and convey neuroprotection. Over the last several decades, the development of new analytical techniques, such as imaging mass spectrometry (IMS), has contributed to our understanding of their involvement in physiological and pathological conditions. IMS allows researchers to obtain a wide range of information about the spatial distribution and abundance of the different lipid molecules that is crucial to understand brain functions. The primary aim of this study was to map the spatial distribution of different lipid species in the rat central nervous system (CNS) using IMS to find a possible relationship between anatomical localization and physiology. The data obtained were subsequently applied to a model of neurological disease, the 192IgG-saporin lesion model of memory impairment. The results were obtained using a LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer in positive and negative ionization modes and analyzed by ImageQuest and MSIReader software. A total of 176 different molecules were recorded based on the specific localization of their intensities. However, only 34 lipid species in negative mode and 51 in positive were assigned to known molecules with an error of 5 ppm. These molecules were grouped by different lipid families, resulting in: Phosphatidylcholines (PC): PC (34: 1) + K+ and PC (32: 0) + K+ distributed primarily in gray matter, and PC (36: 1) + K+ and PC (38: 1) + Na+ distributed in white matter. Phosphatidic acid (PA): PA (38: 3) + K+ in white matter, and PA (38: 5) + K+ in gray matter and brain ventricles. Phosphoinositol (PI): PI (18: 0/20: 4) − H+ in gray matter, and PI (O-30: 1) or PI (P-30: 0) − H+ in white matter. Phosphatidylserines (PS): PS (34: 1) − H+ in gray matter, and PS (38: 1) − H+ in white matter. Sphingomyelin (SM) SM (d18: 1/16: 0) − H+ in ventricles and SM (d18: 1/18: 0) − H+ in gray matter. Sulfatides (ST): ST (d18: 1/24: 1) − H+ in white matter. The specific distribution of different lipids supports their involvement not only in structural and metabolic functions but also as intracellular effectors or specific receptor ligands and/or precursors. Moreover, the specific localization in the CNS described here will enable us to analyze lipid distribution to identify their physiological conditions in rat models of neurodegenerative pathologies, such as Alzheimer's disease.

Earlier studies demonstrated that nAChRs reconstituted into membranes containing phosphatidylcholine (PC), the anionic lipid phosphatidic acid (PA), and cholesterol (CH) are particularly effective at stabilizing the nAChR in the resting (closed) state that is capable of undergoing agonist-induced conformational transitions (i.e., functionality). The present studies demonstrate that (1) there is no obligatory requirement for PC, (2) increasing the CH content serves to increase the degree to which nAChRs are stabilized in the resting state, and this effect saturates at approximately 35 mol {\%} (molar lipid percentage), and (3) the effect of increasing levels of PA saturates at approximately 12 mol {\%} and in the absence of PA nAChRs are stabilized in the desensitized state (i.e., nonfunctional). Native Torpedo membranes contain approximately 35 mol {\%} CH but less than 1 mol {\%} PA, suggesting that other anionic lipids may substitute for PA. We report that (1) phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol (PI), anionic lipids that are abundant in native Torpedo membranes, also stabilize the receptor in the resting state although with reduced efficacy (approximately 50-60{\%}) compared to PA, and (2) for nAChRs reconstituted into PA/CH membranes at different lipid-protein molar ratios, receptor functionality decreases rapidly below approximately 65 lipids per receptor. Collectively, these results are consistent with a functional requirement of a single shell of lipids surrounding the nAChR and specific anionic lipid- and sterol (CH)-protein interactions.},

abstract = {The human {\$}\alpha{\$}7 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene (CHRNA7) is a candidate gene for schizophrenia and an important drug target for cognitive deficits in the disorder. Activation of the {\$}\alpha{\$}7*nAChR, results in opening of the channel and entry of mono- and divalent cations, including Ca2+, that presynaptically participates to neurotransmitter release and postsynaptically to down-stream changes in gene expression. Schizophrenic patients have low levels of {\$}\alpha{\$}7*nAChR, as measured by binding of the ligand [125I]-{\$}\alpha{\$}-bungarotoxin (I-BTX). The structure of the gene, CHRNA7, is complex. During evolution, CHRNA7 was partially duplicated as a chimeric gene (CHRFAM7A), which is expressed in the human brain and elsewhere in the body. The association between a 2 bp deletion in CHRFAM7A and schizophrenia suggested that this duplicate gene might contribute to cognitive impairment. To examine the putative contribution of CHRFAM7A on receptor function, co-expression of {\$}\alpha{\$}7 and the duplicate genes was carried out in cell lines and Xenopus oocytes. Expression of the duplicate alone yielded protein expression but no functional receptor and co-expression with {\$}\alpha{\$}7 caused a significant reduction of the amplitude of the ACh-evoked currents. Reduced current amplitude was not correlated with a reduction of I-BTX binding, suggesting the presence of non-functional (ACh-silent) receptors. This hypothesis is supported by a larger increase of the ACh-evoked current by the allosteric modulator 1-(5-chloro-2,4-dimethoxy-phenyl)-3-(5-methyl-isoxazol-3- yl)-urea (PNU-120596) in cells expressing the duplicate than in the control. These results suggest that CHRFAM7A acts as a dominant negative modulator of CHRNA7 function and is critical for receptor regulation in humans. {\textcopyright}2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Torpedo acetylcholine receptor was reconstituted into liposomes of pure synthetic lipids in order to study the influence of the lipid environment on affinity state transitions and the ion translocation function of the receptor. A critical concentration of 30 to 40{\%} of cholesteryl hemisuccinate was necessary in liposomes made of cholesteryl hemisuccinate and dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine to mimic the kinetics of agonist-induced state transitions observed in native membranes. With increasing chain length of the saturated lecithins, a marked increase in carbamylcholine dissociation constants was observed. Substitution by other dimyristoyl phospholipids for dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine had the same, though quantitatively less pronounced effects. Introduction of unsaturation in the acyl chains reverted the effect of increasing chain length. Unsaturated phosphatidylethanolamines in combination with 28-35 mol{\%} of cholesteryl hemisuccinate was the best lipid mixture for reconstitution of the receptor-gating function. When phosphatidylethanolamine was replaced totally or partially by other phospholipids with the same or different acyl chain composition, a marked decrease of ion transport was apparent, even when similar vesicle size, receptor incorporation, and agonist-induced affinity transitions were obtained. Therefore, the maintenance of the affinity state transitions of the reconstituted receptor is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the manifestation of the ion-gating receptor activity. On the other hand, the more unsaturated the acyl chains of phosphatidylethanolamine are, the higher the response that was observed, suggesting that a critical lipid packing is essential for the ion translocation function of the receptor.},

abstract = {Various types of lipids and their metabolic products associated with the biological membrane play a crucial role in signal transduction, modulation, and activation of receptors and as precursors of bioactive lipid mediators. Dysfunction in the lipid homeostasis in the brain could be a risk factor for the many types of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These neurodegenerative disorders are marked by extensive neuronal apoptosis, gliosis, and alteration in the differentiation, proliferation, and development of neurons. Sphingomyelin, a constituent of plasma membrane, as well as its primary metabolite ceramide acts as a potential lipid second messenger molecule linked with the modulation of various cellular signaling pathways. Excessive production of reactive oxygen species associated with enhanced oxidative stress has been implicated with these molecules and involved in the regulation of a variety of different neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders. Studies have shown that alterations in the levels of plasma lipid/cholesterol concentration may result to neurodegenerative diseases. Alteration in the levels of inflammatory cytokines and mediators in the brain has also been found to be implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. Although several mechanisms involved in neuronal apoptosis have been described, the molecular mechanisms underlying the correlation between lipid metabolism and the neurological deficits are not clearly understood. In the present review, an attempt has been made to provide detailed information about the association of lipids in neurodegeneration especially in Alzheimer's disease.},

Despite annotation of typical C1 domains as diacylglycerol (DAG) and phorbol ester sensors, the function of atypical counterparts remains ill-defined. Here, we assign a key role for atypical C1 domains in mediating DAG fatty acyl specificity of diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) in live cells. Activity-based proteomics mapped C1 probe binding as a principal differentiator of type 1 DGK active sites that combined with global metabolomics revealed a role for C1s in lipid substrate recognition. Protein engineering by C1 domain swapping demonstrated that exchange of typical and atypical C1s is functionally tolerated and can directly program DAG fatty acyl specificity of type 1 DGKs. Collectively, we describe a protein engineering strategy for studying metabolic specificity of lipid kinases to assign a role for atypical C1 domains in cell metabolism.},

A key challenge to a full description of function, however, is the ability to unequivocally relate determined structures to the canonical resting, open, and desensitized states. Here, we review current understanding of pLGIC structure, with a focus on the conformational changes underlying channel gating. We compare available structural information and review the evidence supporting the assignment of each structure to a particular conformational state. We discuss multiple factors that may complicate the interpretation of crystal structures, highlighting the potential influence of lipids and detergents. We contend that further advances in the structural biology of pLGICs will require deeper insight into the nature of pLGIC-lipid interactions. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The glycine receptor (GlyR) belongs to a superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) that mediate fast neurotransmission. GlyR typically modulates inhibitory transmission by antagonizing membrane depolarization through anion influx. Allosteric interactions between the receptor and its lipid surroundings affect receptor function, and cholesterol is essential for pLGIC activity. Cholesterol at compositions below ∼33 mol percent has been shown to have negligible chemical activity, suggesting that specific interactions between membrane proteins and cholesterol become significant only at concentrations above this stoichiometric threshold. Human {\$}\alpha{\$}1 GlyR was purified from baculovirus infected insect cells and reconstituted in unilamellar vesicles at cholesterol/lipid ratios above and below the cholesterol activity threshold with equivalent aliquots of azi-cholesterol, a photoactivatable nonspecific cross-linker. After photoactivation, cross-linked cholesterol-GlyR was trypsinized and mass fingerprinted. Mass shifted peptides containing cholesterol were identified by electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-Q-TOF MS), and sites of direct covalent attachment to peptides were refined by targeted MS/MS. Differential patterns of dozens of cholesterol-GlyR cross-links were identified in these comparative studies, with sites of cross-linking found primarily in the fourth transmembrane helix and extramembranous connecting loops and mapping the lipid-accessible surface of the receptor. Unique cross-linking observed in both reduced and elevated cholesterol composition suggests different apo-state structural conformations of GlyR as a function of cholesterol concentration and, in the latter studies, identified potential specific binding sites for cholesterol in the receptor.},

abstract = {Abstract With the availability of high resolution structural data, increasing attention has focused on the mechanisms by which drugs and endogenous compounds allosterically modulate nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) function. Lipids are potent modulators of the nAChR from Torpedo. Membrane lipids influence nAChR function by both conformational selection and kinetic mechanisms, stabilizing varying proportions of pre-existing resting, open, desensitized, and uncoupled conformations, as well as influencing the transitions between these conformational states. Structural and functional data highlight a role for the lipid-exposed M4 transmembrane ??-helix of each subunit in lipid sensing, and suggest that lipids influence gating by altering the binding of M4 to the adjacent transmembrane ??-helices, M1 and M3. M4 has also been implicated in both the folding and trafficking of nAChRs to the cell surface, as well as in the potentiation of nAChR gating by neurosteroids. Here, we discuss the roles of M4 in the folding, trafficking, and allosteric modulation of nAChRs. We also consider the hypothesis that variable chemistry at the M4-M1/M3 transmembrane ??-helical interface in different nAChR subunits governs the capacity for potentiation by activating lipids.

The viscoelastic properties, including elasticity and viscosity, are significantly different between the two cell lines. MCF-7 displays reduced elasticity and viscosity, indicating that breast cancer cells are softer and more fluid than benign counterpart.

abstract = {Cholesterol is an essential component of cell membranes, and is required for mammalian pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC) function. Computational studies suggest direct interactions between cholesterol and pLGICs but experimental evidence identifying specific binding sites is limited. In this study, we mapped cholesterol binding to Gloeobacter ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC), a model pLGIC chosen for its high level of expression, existing crystal structure, and previous use as a prototypic pLGIC. Using two cholesterol analogue photolabeling reagents with the photoreactive moiety on opposite ends of the sterol, we identified two cholesterol binding sites: an intersubunit site between TM3 and TM1 of adjacent subunits and an intrasubunit site between TM1 and TM4. In both the inter- and intrasubunit sites, cholesterol is oriented such that the 3‑OH group points toward the center of the transmembrane domains rather than toward either the cytosolic or extracellular surfaces. We then compared this binding to that of the cholesterol metabolite, allopregnanolone, a neurosteroid that allosterically modulates pLGICs. The same binding pockets were identified for allopregnanolone and cholesterol, but the binding orientation of the two ligands was markedly different, with the 3‑OH group of allopregnanolone pointing to the intra- and extracellular termini of the transmembrane domains rather than to their centers. We also found that cholesterol increases, whereas allopregnanolone decreases the thermal stability of GLIC. These data indicate that cholesterol and neurosteroids bind to common hydrophobic pockets in the model pLGIC, GLIC, but that their effects depend on the orientation and specific molecular interactions unique to each sterol.},

Recent research in this context focuses especially on highly scalable formalisms for the Web of Data, which may highly benefit from exploiting database technologies. In this paper, as a first step towards closing the gap between the Semantic Web and databases, we introduce a family of expressive extensions of Datalog, called Datalog±, as a new paradigm for query answering over ontologies. The Datalog± family admits existentially quantified variables in rule heads, and has suitable restrictions to ensure highly efficient ontology querying. We show in particular that Datalog± encompasses and generalizes the tractable description logic EL and the DL-Lite family of tractable description logics, which are the most common tractable ontology languages in the context of the Semantic Web and databases. We also show how stratified negation can be added to Datalog± while keeping ontology querying tractable. Furthermore, the Datalog± family is of interest in its own right, and can, moreover, be used in various contexts such as data integration and data exchange. It paves the way for applying results from databases to the context of the Semantic Web.},

abstract = {Cys-loop receptors constitute a superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs), including receptors for acetylcholine, serotonin, glycine and {\$}\gamma{\$}-aminobutyric acid. Several bacterial homologues have been identified that are excellent models for understanding allosteric binding of alcohols and anesthetics in human Cys-loop receptors. Recently, we showed that a single point mutation on a prokaryotic homologue (GLIC) could transform it from a channel weakly potentiated by ethanol into a highly ethanol-sensitive channel. Here, we have employed molecular simulations to study ethanol binding to GLIC, and to elucidate the role of the ethanol-enhancing mutation in GLIC modulation. By performing 1-µs simulations with and without ethanol on wild-type and mutated GLIC, we observed spontaneous binding in both intra-subunit and inter-subunit transmembrane cavities. In contrast to the glycine receptor GlyR, in which we previously observed ethanol binding primarily in an inter-subunit cavity, ethanol primarily occupied an intra-subunit cavity in wild-type GLIC. However, the highly ethanol-sensitive GLIC mutation significantly enhanced ethanol binding in the inter-subunit cavity. These results demonstrate dramatic effects of the F(14')A mutation on the distribution of ligands, and are consistent with a two-site model of pLGIC inhibition and potentiation.},

The relative association constant of phosphatidylinositol was reduced in the presence of the different local anesthetics to the following extents: tetracaine (55{\%}) {\textgreater}procaine (35{\%}) ≈ benzocaine (30{\%}). For stearic acid, only tetracaine gave an appreciable reduction (30{\%}) in association constant.

At the tissue scale we consider a field of displacements that satisfies linear momentum balance, and continuous fields for cells and chemical signal concentrations which obey reaction–diffusion equations. At the cell scale a set of ordinary differential equations describe the dynamics of remodeling. Our major contribution is the modeling and simulation of the coupling of cellular and chemical fields to tissue-level mechanics via local changes in fiber alignment, dispersion, collagen content, permanent area change, elastic deformation, and active contraction. Numerically, the constitutive equations for remodeling are solved at the integration points while the displacements and biological fields are solved monolithically with a finite element formulation. The method presented here is at the junction of applied mechanics and systems biology, two exciting fields that continue to approach each other as we seek to unravel the basic principles of mechanical adaptation in living materials with the aid of computational simulations.},

abstract = {The effects of cholesterol on the ion-channel function of the Torpedo acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and the novel lipid-exposed gain in function $\alpha$C418W mutation have been investigated in Xenopus laevis ooeytes. We found conditions to increase the cholesterol/phospholipid (C/P) molar ratio on the plasma membrane of Xenopus oocytes from 0.5 to 0.87, without significant physical damage or change in morphology to the oocytes. In addition, we developed conditions to deplete endogenous cholesterol from oocytes using a methyl-$\beta$-cyclodextrin incubation procedure without causing membrane instability of the cells. Methyl-$\beta$-cyclodextrin was also used to examine the reversibility of the inhibitory effect of cholesterol on AChR function. Depletion of 43{\%} of endogenous cholesterol from oocytes (C/P = 0.3) did not show any significant change in macroscopic response of the wild type, whereas in the $\alpha$C418W mutant the same cholesterol depletion caused a dramatic gain-in-function response of this lipid-exposed mutation in addition to the increased response caused by the mutation itself. Increasing the C/P ratio to 0.87 caused an inhibition of the macroscopic response of the Torpedo wild type of about 52{\%}, whereas the $\alpha$C418W mutation showed an 81{\%} inhibition compared with the responses of control oocytes. The wild type receptor did not recover from this inhibition when the excess cholesterol was depleted to near normal C/P ratios; however, the $\alpha$C418W mutant displayed 63{\%} of the original current, which indicates that the inhibition of this lipid-exposed mutant was significantly reversed. The ability of the $\alpha$C418W mutation to recover from the inhibition caused by cholesterol enrichment suggests that the interaction of cholesterol with this lipid-exposed mutation is significantly different from that of the wild type. The present data demonstrate that a single lipid-exposed position in the AChR could alter the modulatory effect of cholesterol on AChR function.},

abstract = {Interactions between lipids and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor from Torpedo californica have been measured in reconstituted membranes containing purified receptor and defined lipids. The ability of brominated lipids to partially quench the intrinsic fluorescence of the acetylcholine receptor has been exploited to monitor contacts between the protein and the surrounding lipid. Relative binding constants for lipid binding to the protein have been quantitatively determined by measuring quenching observed in mixtures of brominated and nonbrominated lipids by use of equilibrium exchange equations developed by London and Feigenson [London, E., {\&} Feigenson, G. W. (1981) Biochemistry 20, 1939-1948] and by Simmonds et al. [Simmonds, A. C., Rooney, E. K., {\&} Lee, A. G. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 1432-1441]. Dioleoylphosphatidylcholine and its dibromo derivative are the two principal lipids used in the reconstituted membranes to establish the quenching parameters. Competition studies between cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine indicate that cholesterol does not compete effectively for the phospholipid sites presumed to surround the membrane-embedded portions of the receptor (annular lipids). However, dibromocholesterol partially quenches the receptor and leads to additional quenching of receptor in pure dibromophosphatidylcholine membranes. The results are consistent with the presence of additional binding sites for cholesterol that are not accessible to phospholipids (nonannular sites). Similar results are obtained by using cholesterol hemisuccinate and its dibromo analogue, both of which can be introduced into membranes more easily than cholesterol because of their greater solubility in water. Fatty acids appear to compete for both annular and nonannular sites, and analysis of the quenching data suggests that there are 5-10 nonannular sites associated with the receptor. Cholesterol has been shown to play a critical role in both acetylcholine receptor structural stabilization and ion channel activity, and the results presented here provide additional information about cholesterol-receptor interactions.},

abstract = {abstract: Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to study the secondary structure of purified Torpedo californica nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) in reconstituted membranes. Functional studies have previously demonstrated that the ion channel activity requires the presence of both sterol and negatively charged phospholipids in membranes. The present studies are designed to test the hypothesis that the «-helical structure of AChR may be stabilized by specific lipid molecules (sterol and/or negatively charged phospholipids) and that these «-helices may be responsible for the formation of a potential ion channel. FTIR data show statistically significant (p {\textless}0.005) spectral changes due to cholesterol and negatively charged phospholipids, respectively. On the basis of standard curves describing the relationship between the spectral properties and the secondary structural contents of water-soluble proteins, the observed spectral change at 931 cm " 1 can be interpreted as an apparent change in the «-helix content from about 17{\%} in the absence of sterols to about 20{\%} in the presence of sterols, suggesting that protein-sterol interactions increase the helical structure of the AChR molecule. Similarly, the spectral change at 988 cm " 1 can be interpreted as an apparent increase of /3-sheet content in the AChR molecule from about 20{\%} to about 24{\%} due to the presence of negatively charged phospholipids. Functional AChR in membranes thus appears to be correlated with higher «-helical and /3-sheet contents. It is concluded that one role of specific interactions between membrane protein and lipid molecules may be to maintain specific secondary structures necessary to support the ion channel function of AChR.},

They are oligomeric protein assemblies that convert a chemical signal into an ion flux through the postsynaptic membrane, but the molecular mechanism of gating ions has remained elusive. Here, we present atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of the prokaryotic channels from Gloeobacter violaceus (GLIC) and Erwinia chrysanthemi (ELIC), whose crystal structures are thought to represent the active and the resting states of pLGICs, respectively, and of the eukaryotic glutamate-gated chloride channel from Caenorhabditis elegans (GluCl), whose open-channel structure was determined complexed with the positive allosteric modulator ivermectin. Structural observables extracted from the trajectories of GLIC and ELIC are used as progress variables to analyze the time evolution of GluCl, which was simulated in the absence of ivermectin starting from the structure with bound ivermectin. The trajectory of GluCl with ivermectin removed shows a sequence of structural events that couple agonist unbinding from the extracellular domain to ion-pore closing in the transmembrane domain. Based on these results, we propose a structural mechanism for the allosteric communication leading to deactivation/activation of the GluCl channel. This model of gating emphasizes the coupling between the quaternary twisting and the opening/closing of the ion pore and is likely to apply to other members of the pLGIC family.},

abstract = {The acetylcholine receptor (AChR) from vertebrate skeletal muscle initiates voluntary movement, and its kinetics of activation are crucial for maintaining the safety margin for neuromuscular transmission. Furthermore, the kinetic mechanism of the muscle AChR serves as an archetype for understanding activation mechanisms of related receptors from the Cys-loop superfamily. Here we record currents through single muscle AChR channels with improved temporal resolution approaching half an order of magnitude over our previous best. A range of concentrations of full and partial agonists are used to elicit currents from human wild-type and gain-of-function mutant AChRs. For each agonist–receptor combination, rate constants are estimated from maximum likelihood analysis using a kinetic scheme comprised of agonist binding, priming, and channel gating steps. The kinetic scheme and rate constants are tested by stochastic simulation, followed by incorporation of the experimental step response, sampling rate, background noise, and filter bandwidth. Analyses of the simulated data confirm all rate constants except those for channel gating, which are overestimated because of the established effect of noise on the briefest dwell times. Estimates of the gating rate constants were obtained through iterative simulation followed by kinetic fitting. The results reveal that the agonist association rate constants are independent of agonist occupancy but depend on receptor state, whereas those for agonist dissociation depend on occupancy but not on state. The priming rate and equilibrium constants increase with successive agonist occupancy, and for a full agonist, the forward rate constant increases more than the equilibrium constant; for a partial agonist, the forward rate and equilibrium constants increase equally. The gating rate and equilibrium constants also increase with successive agonist occupancy, but unlike priming, the equilibrium constants increase more than the forward rate constants. As observed for a full and a partial agonist, the gain-of-function mutation affects the relationship between rate and equilibrium constants for priming but not for channel gating. Thus, resolving brief single channel currents distinguishes priming from gating steps and reveals how the corresponding rate and equilibrium constants depend on agonist occupancy.},

Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of GABAA receptors bound to intravenous anaesthetics, benzodiazepines and inhibitory modulators. These structures were solved in a lipidic environment and are complemented by electrophysiology and molecular dynamics simulations. Structures of GABAA receptors in complex with the anaesthetics phenobarbital, etomidate and propofol reveal both distinct and common transmembrane binding sites, which are shared in part by the benzodiazepine drug diazepam. Structures in which GABAA receptors are bound by benzodiazepine-site ligands identify an additional membrane binding site for diazepam and suggest an allosteric mechanism for anaesthetic reversal by flumazenil. This study provides a foundation for understanding how pharmacologically diverse and clinically essential drugs act through overlapping and distinct mechanisms to potentiate inhibitory signalling in the brain.},

As a consequence, therapies based on the regulation of membrane lipid composition and structure have been recently developed. This novel field, known as Membrane Lipid Therapy, is growing and evolving rapidly, providing treatments that are now in use or that are being studied for their application to oncological disorders, Alzheimer's disease, spinal cord injury, stroke, diabetes, obesity, and neuropathic pain. This field has arisen from relevant discoveries on the behavior of membranes in recent decades, and it paves the way to adopt new approaches in modern pharmacology and nutrition. This innovative area will promote further investigation into membranes and the development of new therapies with molecules that target the cell membrane. Due to the prominent roles of membranes in the cells' physiology and the paucity of therapeutic approaches based on the regulation of the lipids they contain, it is expected that membrane lipid therapy will provide new treatments for numerous pathologies. The first on-purpose rationally designed molecule in this field, minerval, is currently being tested in clinical trials and it is expected to enter the market around 2020. However, it seems feasible that during the next few decades other membrane regulators will also be marketed for the treatment of human pathologies.

The evolutionarily conserved design is manifested in: 1) the concentric three-ring architecture of the transmembrane region, 2) the occurrence in this region of distinct lipid consensus motifs in prokaryotic and eukaryotic pLGIC and 3) the key participation of the outer TM4 ring in conveying the influence of the lipid membrane environment to the middle TM1-TM3 ring and this, in turn, to the inner TM2 channel-lining ring, which determines the ion selectivity of the channel. The preservation of these constant structural-functional features throughout such a long phylogenetic span likely points to the successful gain-of-function conferred by their early acquisition.

Spin-labeled lipids were incorporated into the reconstituted membranes and into native membranes prepared from Torpedo electroplax, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded between 0 and 20 degrees C. The spin-labels included nitroxide derivatives of stearic acid (16-doxylstearic acid), androstane, phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), and phosphatidic acid (PA). The phospholipid spin-labels had 16-doxylstearic acid in the sn-2 position. All the spectra showed two components corresponding to a relatively mobile bilayer component and a motionally restricted "protein-perturbed" component. The relative amounts of mobile and perturbed components were quantitated by spectral subtraction and integration techniques. The mobile/perturbed ratio was somewhat temperature dependent, and the results are discussed in terms of exchange between mobile and perturbed environments. Plots of the mobile/perturbed ratios vs. lipid/protein ratios at 1 degree C gave straight lines from which the relative binding affinity of each spin-label and the number of perturbed lipids per receptor protein could be calculated. All the spin-labels gave similar values for the number of perturbed lipids (40 +/- 7), a number close to the number of lipids that will fit around the intramembranous perimeter of the receptor. The affinities of the spin-labeled lipids for the receptor relative to DOPC were androstane (K = 4.3) congruent to 16-doxylstearic acid (4.1) greater than PA (2.7) greater than PE (1.1) approximately PC (1.0) approximately PS (0.7).

abstract = {The Cys-loop receptor superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels has a prominent role in neuronal signalling. These receptors are pentamers, each subunit containing ten beta-strands in the extracellular domain and four alpha-helical transmembrane domains (M1-M4). The M2 domain of each subunit lines the intrinsic ion channel pore and residues within the extracellular domain form ligand binding sites. Ligand binding initiates a conformational change that opens the ion-selective pore. The coupling between ligand binding in the extracellular domain and opening of the intrinsic ion channel pore located in the membrane is not fully understood. Several loop structures, such as loop 2, the Cys-loop, the pre-M1 region and the M2-M3 loop have been implicated in receptor activation. The current "conformational change wave" hypothesis suggests that binding of a ligand initiates a rotation of the beta-sheets around an axis that passes through the Cys-loop. Due to this rotation, the Cys-loop and loop 2 are displaced. Movement of the M2-M3 loop then twists the M2 domain leading to a separation of the helices and opening of the pore. The publication of a crystal structure of an acetylcholine binding protein and the refined structure of the Torpedo marmorata acetylcholine receptor have improved the understanding of the mechanisms and structures involved in coupling ligand binding to channel gating. In this review, the most recent findings on some of these loop structures will be reported and discussed in view of their role in the gating mechanism.},

abstract = {Site-directed mutagenesis was used to mutate alpha Cys418 and beta Cys447 in the M4 domain of Torpedo californica acetylcholine receptor expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The M4 region is a transmembrane domain thought to be located at the lipid-protein interface. By whole-cell voltage clamp analysis, mutation of both alpha subunits to alpha Trp418 increased maximal channel activity approximately threefold, increased the desensitization rate compared with wild-type receptor, and shifted the EC50 for acetylcholine from 32 microM to 13 microM. Patch measurements of single-channel currents revealed that the alpha Trp418 increased channel open times approximately 28-fold at 13 degrees C with no effect on channel conductance. All of our measured functional changes in the alpha Trp418 mutant are consistent with a simple kinetic model of the acetylcholine receptor in which only the channel closing rate is altered by the mutation. Our results show that changes in protein structure at the putative lipid-protein interface can dramatically affect receptor function. {\textcopyright}1994, The Biophysical Society.

abstract = {Reconstituted nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) exhibit significant gain-of-function upon addition of cholesterol to reconstitution mixtures, and cholesterol affects the organization of nAChRs within domain-forming membranes, but whether nAChR partitions to cholesterol-rich liquid-ordered (“raft” or l o ) domains or cholesterol-poor liquid-disordered (l do ) domains is unknown. We use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to observe spontaneous interactions of cholesterol, saturated lipids, and polyunsaturated (PUFA) lipids with nAChRs. In binary Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine:Cholesterol (DPPC:CHOL) mixtures, both CHOL and DPPC acyl chains were observed spontaneously entering deep “non-annular” cavities in the nAChR TMD, particularly at the subunit interface and the $\beta$ subunit center, facilitated by the low amino acid density in the cryo-EM structure of nAChR in a native membrane. Cholesterol was highly enriched in the annulus around the TMD, but this effect extended over (at most) 5–10 {\AA}. In domain-forming ternary mixtures containing PUFAs, the presence of a single receptor did not significantly affect the likelihood of domain formation. nAChR partitioned to any cholesterol-poor l do domain that was present, regardless of whether the l do or l o domain lipids had PC or PE headgroups. Enrichment of PUFAs among boundary lipids was positively correlated with their propensity for demixing from cholesterol-rich phases. Long n-3 chains (tested here with Docosahexaenoic Acid, DHA) were highly enriched in annular and non-annular embedded sites, partially displacing cholesterol and completely displacing DPPC, and occupying sites even deeper within the bundle. Shorter n-6 chains were far less effective at displacing cholesterol from non-annular sites.},

We find that the behavioral response is tuned to temporal properties of mechanosensory signals, such as their integral and derivative, that extend over many seconds. Mechanosensory signals, even in the same neurons, can be tailored to elicit different behavioral responses. Moreover, we find that the animal's response also depends on its behavioral context.

abstract = {In large neuronal networks, it is believed that functions emerge through the collective behavior of many interconnected neurons. Recently, the development of experimental techniques that allow simultaneous recording of calcium concentration from a large fraction of all neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans - a nematode with 302 neurons - creates the opportunity to ask whether such emergence is universal, reaching down to even the smallest brains. Here, we measure the activity of 50+ neurons in C. elegans, and analyze the data by building the maximum entropy model that matches the mean activity and pairwise correlations among these neurons. To capture the graded nature of the cells' responses, we assign each cell multiple states. These models, which are equivalent to a family of Potts glasses, successfully predict higher statistical structure in the network. In addition, these models exhibit signatures of collective behavior: the state of single cells can be predicted from the state of the rest of the network; the network, despite being sparse in a way similar to the structural connectome, distributes its response globally when locally perturbed; the distribution over network states has multiple local maxima, as in models of memory; and the parameters that describe the real network are close to a critical surface in this family of models.},

While lipid domains have maintained nAChR aggregates in vitro, their specific roles in nAChR clustering are currently unknown. In the present study, we carried out coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations (CG-MD) of 1–4 nAChR molecules in two membrane environments: one mixture containing domain-forming, homoacidic lipids, and a second mixture consisting of heteroacidic lipids. Spontaneous dimerization of nAChRs was up to ten times more likely in domain-forming membranes; however, the effect was not significant in four-protein systems, suggesting that lipid domains are less critical to nAChR oligomerization when protein concentration is higher. With regard to lipid preferences, nAChRs consistently partitioned into liquid-disordered domains occupied by the omega-3 ($\omega$-3) fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA); enrichment of DHA boundary lipids increased with protein concentration, particularly in homoacidic membranes. This result suggests dimer formation blocks access of saturated chains and cholesterol, but not polyunsaturated chains, to boundary lipid sites.},

abstract = {Although a large number of ion channels are now believed to be regulated by phosphoinositides, particularly phosphoinositide 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), the mechanisms involved in phosphoinositide regulation are unclear. For the TRP superfamily of ion channels, the role and mechanism of PIP2 modulation has been especially difficult to resolve. Outstanding questions include: is PIP2 the endogenous regulatory lipid; does PIP2 potentiate all TRPs or are some TRPs inhibited by PIP2; where does PIP2 interact with TRP channels; and is the mechanism of modulation conserved among disparate subfamilies? We first addressed whether the PIP2 sensor resides within the primary sequence of the channel itself, or, as recently proposed, within an accessory integral membrane protein called Pirt. Here we show that Pirt does not alter the phosphoinositide sensitivity of TRPV1 in HEK-293 cells, that there is no FRET between TRPV1 and Pirt, and that dissociated dorsal root ganglion neurons from Pirt knock-out mice have an apparent affinity for PIP2 indistinguishable from that of their wild-type littermates. We followed by focusing on the role of the C terminus of TRPV1 in sensing PIP2. Here, we show that the distal C-terminal region is not required for PIP2 regulation, as PIP2 activation remains intact in channels in which the distal C-terminal has been truncated. Furthermore, we used a novel in vitro binding assay to demonstrate that the proximal C-terminal region of TRPV1 is sufficient for PIP2 binding. Together, our data suggest that the proximal C-terminal region of TRPV1 can interact directly with PIP2 and may play a key role in PIP2 regulation of the channel. {\textcopyright} 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

@article{Kumar2019,
abstract = {The lipid dependence of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor from the Torpedo electric organ has long been recognized, and one of the most consistent experimental observations is that, when reconstituted in membranes formed by zwitterionic phospholipids alone, exposure to agonist fails to elicit ion-flux activity. More recently, it has been suggested that the bacterial homolog ELIC (Erwinia chrysanthemi ligand-gated ion channel) has a similar lipid sensitivity. As a first step toward the elucidation of the structural basis of this phenomenon, we solved the structures of ELIC embedded in palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine-(POPC-) only nanodiscs in both the unliganded (4.1-{\AA} resolution) and agonist-bound (3.3 {\AA}) states using single-particle cryoelectron microscopy. Comparison of the two structural models revealed that the largest differences occur at the level of loop Cat the agonist-binding sites-and the loops at the interface between the extracellular and transmembrane domains (ECD and TMD, respectively). On the other hand, the transmembrane pore is occluded in a remarkably similar manner in both structures. A straightforward interpretation of these findings is that POPC-only membranes frustrate the ECD-TMD coupling in such a way that the "conformational wave" of liganded-receptor gating takes place in the ECD and the interfacial M2-M3 linker but fails to penetrate the membrane and propagate into the TMD. Furthermore, analysis of the structural models and molecular simulations suggested that the higher affinity for agonists characteristic of the open-and desensitized-channel conformations results, at least in part, from the tighter confinement of the ligand to its binding site; this limits the ligand's fluctuations, and thus delays its escape into bulk solvent. Cys-loop receptors | structure-function relationships | lipid membranes | molecular dynamics | allosteric proteins P hospholipid membranes often contribute a large fraction of the environment to which integral membrane proteins are exposed. As a result, it is not surprising to find that the confor-mational free-energy landscapes of these proteins are affected by solubilization in detergents or even by the particular chemical composition of the lipid bilayer in which they are embedded. Among ion channels, for example, the fact that some detergent-solubilized, agonist-bound neurotransmitter-gated ion channels have been imaged in what is very likely to be the open-channel conformation is, in and of itself, evidence for this lipid sensitivity. Indeed, if we have learned anything about these membrane proteins in the last few decades, it is that agonist binding biases the mixture of closed, open, and desensitized conformations toward the desensitized state, and that the equilibrium is attained in a few tens of seconds, at the longest. It seems inescapable to propose that the lack of a membrane environment may explain this disconnect between what is expected from a membrane-embedded channel and what is actually observed in structural studies upon detergent solubilization. One well-known example of an ion channel that displays marked lipid sensitivity is the muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) from the electric organ of Torpedo fish. It has been suggested that specific protein-lipid interactions are required for this receptor-channel to undergo the low-affinity ⇌ high-affinity interconversion of the (extracellular) ACh-binding sites (e.g., refs. 1-8), as well as the nonconductive ⇌ ion-conductive interconversion of the transmembrane pore (e.g., refs. 5-12). The molar fraction of cholesterol, the type of phospholipid polar head group, and the length and degree of saturation of the acyl chains have been found to be variables of a complex relationship between lipid-bilayer chemical composition and receptor-channel function. Intriguingly, certain membrane compositions led to a behavior consistent with the disruption of the strict coupling between binding-site affinity and pore permeability (5, 6, 9) that is central Significance Phospholipid membranes often contribute a large fraction of the environment to which integral membrane proteins are exposed. As a result, the behavior of these proteins is commonly affected by solubilization in detergent micelles or even by the particular chemical composition of the lipid bilayer in which they are embedded. In this work, we report cryoelectron microscopy structures of the bacterial pentameric ligand-gated ion channel ELIC embedded in nanodiscs formed by palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) molecules alone, a lipid composition that reduces this channel's activity to a large extent. Comparison of the unliganded and agonist-bound structural models suggests that POPC membranes disrupt the strict coupling between binding-site affinity and pore permeability that underlies the operation of all ligand-gated ion channels.},

abstract = {Over the past 16 years, there has been an impressive number of ion channels shown to be sensitive to the major phosphoinositide in the plasma membrane, phosphatidylinositol 4,5bisphosphate (PIP2). Among them are voltage-gated channels, which are crucial for both neuronal and cardiac excitability. Voltage-gated calcium (Cav) channels were shown to be regulated bidirectionally by PIP2. On one hand, PIP2 stabilized their activity by reducing current rundown but on the other hand it produced a voltage-dependent inhibition by shifting the activation curve to more positive voltages. For voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels PIP2 was first shown to prevent N-type inactivation regardless of whether the fast inactivation gate was part of the pore-forming $\alpha$ subunit or of an accessory $\beta$ subunit. Careful examination of the effects of PIP2 on the activation mechanism of Kv1.2 has shown a similar bidirectional regulation as in the Cav channels. The two effects could be distinguished kinetically, in terms of their sensitivities to PIP2 and by distinct molecular determinants. The rightward shift of the Kv1.2 voltage dependence implicated basic residues in the S4-S5 linker and was consistent with stabilization of the inactive state of the voltage sensor. A third type of a voltage-gated ion channel modulated by PIP2 is the hyperpolarizationactivated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel. PIP2 has been shown to enhance the opening of HCN channels by shifting their voltage-dependent activation toward depolarized potentials. The sea urchin HCN channel, SpIH, showed again a PIP2-mediated bidirectional effect but in reverse order than the depolarization-activated Cav and Kv channels: a voltagedependent potentiation, like the mammalian HCN channels, but also an inhibition of the cGMP-induced current activation. Just like the Kv1.2 channels, distinct molecular determinants underlied the PIP2 dual effects on SpIH, with the proximal C-terminus implicated in the inhibitory effect. The dual regulation of these very different ion channels, all of which are voltage-dependent, points to conserved mechanisms of regulation of these channels by PIP2. {\textcopyright} 2012 Rodr{\'{i}}guez-Menchaca, Adney, Zhou and Logothetis.},

abstract = {The past decade, membrane signaling lipids emerged as major regulators of ion channel function. However, the molecular nature of lipid binding to ion channels remained poorly described due to a lack of structural information and assays to quantify and measure lipid binding in a membrane. How does a lipid-ligand bind to a membrane protein in the plasma membrane, and what does it mean for a lipid to activate or regulate an ion channel? How does lipid binding compare to activation by soluble neurotransmitter? And how does the cell control lipid agonism? This review focuses on lipids and their interactions with membrane proteins, in particular, ion channels. I discuss the intersection of membrane lipid biology and ion channel biophysics. A picture emerges of membrane lipids as bona fide agonists of ligand-gated ion channels. These freely diffusing signals reside in the plasma membrane, bind to the transmembrane domain of protein, and cause a conformational change that allosterically gates an ion channel.

Identification and characterization of these sites are of importance for our understanding of the molecular basis of membrane protein function and stability, and may facilitate the design of lipid-like drug molecules. Molecular dynamics simulations provide a powerful tool for the identification of these sites, complementing advances in membrane protein structural biology and biophysics. We describe recent notable biomolecular simulation studies which have identified lipid interaction sites on a range of different membrane proteins. The sites identified in these simulation studies agree well with those identified by complementary experimental techniques. This demonstrates the power of the molecular dynamics approach in the prediction and characterization of lipid interaction sites on integral membrane proteins.

abstract = {Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) participate in diverse aspects of brain function and mediate behavioral and addictive properties of nicotine. Neuronal nAChRs derive from combinations of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits, whose assembly is tightly regulated. NACHO was recently identified as a chaperone for $\alpha$7-type nAChRs. Here, we find NACHO mediates assembly of all major classes of presynaptic and postsynaptic nAChR tested. NACHO acts at early intracellular stages of nAChR subunit assembly and then synergizes with RIC-3 for receptor surface expression. NACHO knockout mice show profound deficits in binding sites for $\alpha$-bungarotoxin, epibatidine, and conotoxin MII, illustrating essential roles for NACHO in proper assembly of $\alpha$7-, $\alpha$4$\beta$2-, and $\alpha$6-containing nAChRs, respectively. By contrast, GABAA receptors are unaffected consistent with NACHO specifically modulating nAChRs. NACHO knockout mice show abnormalities in locomotor and cognitive behaviors compatible with nAChR deficiency and underscore the importance of this chaperone for physiology and disease associated with nAChRs.},

The insertion and assembly of $\beta$-barrel outer-membrane proteins (OMPs) is mediated by the $\beta$-barrel assembly machinery (BAM) complex, the core component of which is the 16-stranded transmembrane $\beta$-barrel BamA. Recent studies have indicated a possible role played by the seam between the first and last $\beta$-barrel strands of BamA in the OMP insertion process through lateral gating and a destabilized membrane region. In this study, we have determined the stability and dynamics of the lateral gate through over 12.5 µs of equilibrium simulations and 4 µs of free-energy calculations. From the equilibrium simulations, we have identified a persistent kink in the C-terminal strand and observed spontaneous lateral-gate separation in a mimic of the native bacterial outer membrane. Free-energy calculations of lateral gate opening revealed a significantly lower barrier to opening in the C-terminal kinked conformation; mutagenesis experiments confirm the relevance of C-terminal kinking to BamA structure and function.},

We hypothesized that with acute warming the structure and function of neuronal membranes in the Antarctic notothenioid fish Chaenocephalus aceratus are more vulnerable to perturbation than membranes in the more thermotolerant notothenioid Notothenia coriiceps. Fluidity was quantified in synaptic membranes, mitochondrial membranes, and myelin from brains of both species of Antarctic fishes. Polar lipid compositions and cholesterol contents were analyzed in myelin; cholesterol was measured in synaptic membranes. Thermal profiles were determined for activities of two membrane-associated proteins, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and Na + /K + -ATPase (NKA), from brains of animals maintained at ambient temperature or exposed to their critical thermal maxima (CT MAX ). Synaptic membranes of C. aceratus were consistently more fluid than those of N. coriiceps (P {\textless} 0.0001). Although the fluidities of both myelin and mitochondrial membranes were similar among species, sensitivity of myelin fluidity to in vitro warming was greater in N. coriiceps than in C. aceratus (P {\textless} 0.001), which can be explained by lower cholesterol contents in myelin of N. coriiceps (P {\textless} 0.05). Activities of both enzymes, AChE and NKA, declined upon CT MAX exposure in C. aceratus, but not in N. coriiceps. We suggest that hyper-fluidization of synaptic membranes with warming in C. aceratus may explain the greater stenothermy in this species, and that thermal limits in notothenioids are more likely to be influenced by perturbations in synaptic membranes than in other membranes of the nervous system.},

abstract = {Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease affecting upper and lower motor neurons, with unknown aetiology. Lipid rafts, cholesterol enriched microdomains of the plasma membrane, have been linked to neurodegenerative disorders like ALS. The NMDA-receptor subcellular localization in lipid rafts is known to play many roles, from modulating memory strength to neurotoxicity. In this study, performed on the widely used G93A mouse model of ALS, we have shown an equal content of total membrane cholesterol in Control and G93A cortical cultures. Moreover, by electrophysiological studies, we have recorded NMDA- and AMPA-evoked currents which were not significantly different between the two neuronal populations. To study the role of membrane cholesterol on glutamate receptor functionality, we have analysed NMDA and AMPA receptors following cholesterol membrane depletion by methyl-$\beta$-cyclodextrin (M$\beta$CD). Interestingly, M$\beta$CD chronic treatment has provoked a significant reduction of NMDA-evoked currents in both cellular populations which was dose- and time-dependent but significantly higher in ALS neurons compared to Control. The different M$\beta$CD effect on NMDA-evoked currents was not due to a different membrane receptor subunit composition but seemed to cause in both neuronal populations a NMDA receptor membrane redistribution. M$\beta$CD treatment effect was receptor-specific since no alterations in the two neuronal populations were detected on AMPA receptors. These results lead us to speculate for an altered proteomic composition of lipid rafts in cortical mutated neurons and suggest the need for further studies on the lipid rafts composition and on their interaction with membrane receptors in ALS cortices.},

abstract = {Neuronal synapses are the fundamental units of neural signal transduction and must maintain exquisite signal fidelity while also accommodating the plasticity that underlies learning and development. To achieve these goals, the molecular composition and spatial organization of synaptic terminals must be tightly regulated; however, little is known about the regulation of lipid composition and organization in synaptic membranes. Here we quantify the comprehensive lipidome of rat synaptic membranes during postnatal development and observe dramatic developmental lipidomic remodeling during the first 60 postnatal days, including progressive accumulation of cholesterol, plasmalogens, and sphingolipids. Further analysis of membranes associated with isolated postsynaptic densities (PSDs) suggests the PSD-Associated postsynaptic plasma membrane (PSD-PM) as one specific location of synaptic remodeling. We analyze the biophysical consequences of developmental remodeling in reconstituted synaptic membranes and observe remarkably stable microdomains, with the stability of domains increasing with developmental age. We rationalize the developmental accumulation of microdomain-forming lipids in synapses by proposing a mechanism by which palmitoylation of the immobilized scaffold protein PSD-95 nucleates domains at the postsynaptic plasma membrane. These results reveal developmental changes in lipid composition and palmitoylation that facilitate the formation of postsynaptic membrane microdomains, which may serve key roles in the function of the neuronal synapse.},

abstract = {A fundamental feature of cellular plasma membranes (PM) is the asymmetric distribution of lipids between the bilayer leaflets. This asymmetry is central to cellular physiology, regulating signaling, apoptosis, coagulation, and cell-cell fusion. While the broad transbilayer distributions of some lipid types are well established, the detailed lipidomic asymmetry of the PM has not been characterized and thus the compositions of the individual leaflets remain poorly understood. Further, how these compositional differences contribute to structural asymmetries between PM leaflets in living cells is not defined. Here, we report the distinct lipidomes and biophysical properties of both monolayers in living mammalian PMs. Using mass spectrometry coupled to enzymatic digestion, we report the detailed compositions of PM leaflets of human erythrocytes. We find a dramatic asymmetry in phospholipid unsaturation, with the cytoplasmic leaflet being {\~{}}2-fold more unsaturated than the exoplasmic. Atomistic simulations of lipid mixtures compiled from the lipidomic observations suggested significant asymmetries in lipid order, packing, and dynamics between the two PM leaflets. These were probed directly in the PM of living cells by Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) of leaflet-selective, environment-sensitive probes. The outer PM leaflet is highly packed and ordered, resembling a liquid ordered phase, whereas the inner leaflet is significantly more disordered. This biophysical asymmetry is maintained in the endocytic system. These observations reveal the detailed compositional and biophysical asymmetry of mammalian plasma membranes, elucidating fundamental design principles of living membranes. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The asymmetric distribution of lipids between the two bilayer leaflets is a fundamental feature of mammalian plasma membranes. Here, we quantify the comprehensive lipidomes of the two PM leaflets in living mammalian cells and examine their consequences on leaflet physical properties. Using computer simulations, we predict distinct biophysical features for the two leaflets and confirm these with a variety of spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. We find that the outer leaflet of the membrane contains many more fully saturated lipids, which endows it with higher lipid packing and lower diffusivity.},

In particular, the highly unsaturated phospholipids in synaptic plasma membranes in the CNS are known to play an important role in modulating receptor function and neurotransmitter release processes. Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a major apolipoprotein in the CNS, mediating the transport of cholesterol, phospholipids and their fatty acids, particularly in reparative mechanisms during neuronal injury. This study was performed to determine whether deficiency in the apoE gene contributes to an alteration of the phospholipids in synaptic plasma membranes. Phospholipid molecular species were identified and quantitated by HPLC/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. Analysis of the different phospholipid classes in membranes of apoE-deficient and C57BL/6 J mice indicated no obvious differences in the distribution of different phospholipid classes but substantial differences in composition of phospholipid molecular species. Of special interest was the prevalence of phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine, diacyl-phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine) with 22:6n-3 in both the sn-1 and sn-2 positions of SPM and these phospholipid species were significantly higher in apoE-deficient mice as compared to control mice. Since polyunsaturated fatty acids in neurons are mainly supplied by astrocytes, these results revealed a new role for apoE in regulating polyunsaturated phospholipid molecular species in neuronal membranes.},

abstract = {Mass spectrometry is a central analytical technique for protein research and for the study of biomolecules in general. Driven by the need to identify, characterize, and quantify proteins at ever increasing sensitivity and in ever more complex samples, a wide range of new mass spectrometry-based analytical platforms and experimental strategies have emerged. Here we review recent advances in mass spectrometry instrumentation in the context of current and emerging research strategies in protein science. T he ability to identify proteins and to determine their covalent structures has been central to the life sciences. The amino acid sequence of proteins provides a link between proteins and their coding genes via the genetic code, and, in principle, a link between cell physiology and genetics. The identification of proteins provides a window into complex cellular regulatory networks. Before the genomics revolution, chemical or enzymatic methods were used to probe the co-valent structure of single, highly purified proteins, and typically, the products of such reactions were detected by ultraviolet (UV) absorbance or fluorescent spectroscopy. For example, polypeptides were sequenced by stepwise chemical degradation from the N terminus to the C terminus (Edman degradation), with subsequent identification of the released amino acid derivatives by UV absorbance spectroscopy. Gradually over the past two decades , mass spectrometers were interfaced with a number of protein chemistry assays to create detectors providing superior information. With the increased performance and versatility of the instrumentation, new protein analytical strategies have emerged in which mass spectrometry is the central element. For example, by the mid-1990s, a variety of mass spectrometry-based strategies had essentially replaced the Edman degradation as the mainstream method for determining the amino acid sequences of polypeptides. The trend toward mass spectrometry as the technique of choice for identifying and probing the covalent structure of proteins was accelerated by the genome project. Genomics demonstrated the power of high-throughput, comprehensive analyses of biological systems. Genomics also provides complete genomic sequences, which are a critical resource for identifying proteins quickly and robustly by the correlation of mass-spectrometric measurements of peptides with sequence databases. The systematic analysis of all the proteins in a tissue or cell was popularized under the name proteomics, with mass spectrom-etry central to most proteomic strategies. The analysis of a full proteome presents a formidable task and, in spite of recent technical developments, remains to be achieved for any species. The task is challenging because pro-teomes have a large and unknown complexity. What is certain is that the number of proteins in a species{\_} proteome exceeds by far the number of genes in the corresponding genome. This diversity arises from the fact that a particular gene can generate multiple distinct proteins as a result of alternative splicing of primary transcripts, the presence of sequence polymorphisms, post-translational modifications, and other protein-processing mechanisms. Moreover, proteins span a concentration range that exceeds the dynamic range of any single analytical method or instrument. For example, it has been estimated that the concentration range of serum proteins exceeds 10 orders of magnitude (1). Although these challenges are daunting, they have stimulated advances in technologies for the analysis of proteins and proteomes. Here we describe a range of mass-spectrometric techniques, discuss their utility for protein analysis, and assess their ability to support or interface with a range of proteomic strategies. MS Instruments and Their Use Mass spectrometry was restricted for a long time to small and thermostable compounds because of the lack of effective techniques to softly ionize and transfer the ionized molecules from the condensed phase into the gas phase without excessive fragmentation. The development in the late 1980s of two techniques for the routine and general formation of molecular ions of intact biomolecules-electrospray ionization (ESI) (2) and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) (3)-dramatically changed this situation and made polypeptides accessible to mass-spectrometric analysis. This catalyzed the development of new mass analyzers and complex multistage instruments [for instance, hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-Q-ToF) and tandem time-of-flight (ToF-ToF) instruments] (Table 1) designed to tackle the challenges of protein and proteome analysis (4, 5). Mass spectrometers are used either to measure simply the molecular mass of a polypeptide or to determine additional structural features including the amino acid sequence or the site of attachment and type of posttranslational modifications. In the former case, single-stage mass spectrometers are used, acting essentially as balances to weigh molecules. In the latter case, after the initial mass determination , specific ions are selected and subjected to fragmentation through collision. In such experiments , referred to as tandem mass spectrom-etry (MS/MS), detailed structural features of the peptides can be inferred from the analysis of the masses of the resulting fragments. The types of mass spectrometers described below are most commonly used to support a range of research strategies in the protein sciences. They differ in their physical principles, their performance standards, their mode of operation, and their ability to support specific analytical strategies.},

abstract = {Line tension ($\gamma$) is a key parameter for the structure and dynamics of membrane domains. It was proposed that hybrid lipids, with mixed saturated and unsaturated acyl chains, participate in the relaxation of $\gamma$ through different mechanisms. In this work, we used molecular dynamics simulations of the coarse-grained MARTINI model to measure $\gamma$ in liquid-ordered−liquid-disordered (Lo−Ld) membranes , with increasingly larger relative proportion of the hybrid polyunsaturated lipid PAPC (4:0−5:4PC) to DAPC (di5:4PC) (i.e., X H). We also calculated an elastic contribution to $\gamma$ by the Lo−Ld thickness mismatch, tilt moduli, and bending moduli, as predicted by theory. We found that an increase in X H decreased the overall $\gamma$ value and the elastic contribution to line tension. The effect on the elastic line tension is driven by a reduced hydrophobic mismatch. Changes in the elastic constants of the phases due to an increase in X H produced a slightly larger elastic $\gamma$ term. In addition to this elastic energy, other major contributions to $\gamma$ are found in these model membranes. Increasing X H decreases both elastic and nonelastic contributions to $\gamma$. Finally, PAPC also behaves as a linactant, relaxing $\gamma$ through an interfacial effect, as predicted by theoretical results. This study gives insight into the actual contribution of distinct energy terms to $\gamma$ in bilayers containing polyunsaturated hybrid lipids.},

abstract = {When micron-scale compositional heterogeneity develops in membranes, the distribution of lipids on one face of the membrane strongly affects the distribution on the other. Specifically, when lipid membranes phase separate into coexisting liquid phases, domains in each monolayer leaflet of the membrane are colocalized with domains in the opposite leaflet. Colocalized domains have never been observed to spontaneously move out of registry. This result indicates that the lipid compositions in one leaflet are strongly coupled to compositions in the opposing leaflet. Predictions of the interleaflet coupling parameter, $\Lambda$, vary by a factor of 50. We measure the value of $\Lambda$ by applying high shear forces to supported lipid bilayers. This causes the upper leaflet to slide over the lower leaflet, moving domains out of registry. We find that the threshold shear stress required to deregister domains in the upper and lower leaflets increases with the inverse length of domains. We derive a simple, closed-form expression relating the threshold shear to $\Lambda$, and find $\Lambda$ = 0.016 ± 0.004 kBT/nm2.},

abstract = {Membrane domains known as rafts are rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids, and are thought to be thicker than the surrounding membrane. If so, monolayers should elastically deform so as to avoid exposure of hydrophobic surfaces to water at the raft boundary. We calculated the energy of splay and tilt deformations necessary to avoid such hydrophobic exposure. The derived value of energy per unit length, the line tension y, depends on the elastic moduli of the raft and the surrounding membrane; it increases quadratically with the initial difference in thickness between the raft and surround; and it is reduced by differences, either positive or negative, in spontaneous curvature between the two. For zero spontaneous curvature, $\gamma$ is ∼1 pN for a monolayer height mismatch of ∼0.3 nm, in agreement with experimental measurement. Our model reveals conditions that could prevent rafts from forming, and a mechanism that can cause rafts to remain small. Prevention of raft formation is based on our finding that the calculated line tension is negative if the difference in spontaneous curvature for a raft and the surround is sufficiently large: rafts cannot form if $\gamma$ {\textless} 0 unless molecular interactions (ignored in the model) are strong enough to make the total line tension positive. Control of size is based on our finding that the height profile from raft to surround does not decrease monotonically, but rather exhibits a damped, oscillatory behavior. As an important consequence, the calculated energy of interaction between rafts also oscillates as it decreases with distance of separation, creating energy barriers between closely apposed rafts. The height of the primary barrier is a complex function of the spontaneous curvatures of the raft and the surround. This barrier can kinetically stabilize the rafts against merger. Our physical theory thus quantifies conditions that allow rafts to form, and further, defines the parameters that control raft merger. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {The mechanisms underlying lipid-sensing by membrane proteins is of considerable biological importance. A unifying mechanistic question is how a change in structure at the lipid-protein interface is translated through the transmembrane domain to influence structures critical to protein function. Gating of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is sensitive to its lipid environment. To understand how changes at the lipid-protein interface influence gating, we examined how a mutation at position 418 on the lipid-facing surface of the outer most M4 transmembrane $\alpha$-helix alters the energetic couplings between M4 and the remainder of the transmembrane domain. Human muscle nAChR is sensitive to mutations at position 418, with the Cys-to-Trp mutation resulting in a 16-fold potentiation in function that leads to a congenital myasthenic syndrome. Energetic coupling between M4 and the Cys-loop, a key structure implicated in gating, do not change with C418W. Instead, Trp418 and an adjacent residue couple energetically with residues on the M1 transmembrane $\alpha$-helix, leading to a reorientation of M1 that stabilizes the open state. We thus identify an allosteric link connecting the lipid-protein interface of the nAChR to altered channel function.},

abstract = {In the absence of activating anionic lipids and cholesterol, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) from Torpedo adopts an uncoupled conformation that does not usually gate open in response to agonist. The uncoupled conformation binds both agonists and non-competitive channel blockers with a lower affinity than the desensitized state, consistent with both the extracellular agonist-binding and transmembrane channel-gating domains individually adopting resting-state like conformations. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the binding of the agonist, acetylcholine, and two fluorescent channel blockers, ethidium and crystal violet, to resting, desensitized and uncoupled nAChRs in reconstituted membranes. The measured Kd for acetylcholine binding to the uncoupled nAChR is similar to that for the resting state, confirming that the agonist binding site adopts a resting-state like conformation. Although both ethidium and crystal violet bind to the resting and desensitized channel pores with distinct affinities, no binding of either probe was detected to the uncoupled nAChR. Our data suggest that the transmembrane domain of the uncoupled nAChR adopts a conformation distinct from that of the resting and desensitized states. The lack of binding is consistent with a more constricted channel pore, possibly along the lines of what is observed in crystal structures of the prokaryotic homolog, ELIC.},

Neurosteroids are endogenous modulators of neuronal excitability and nervous system development and are being developed as anesthetic agents and treatments for psychiatric diseases. While gamma amino-butyric acid Type A (GABA A ) receptors are the primary molecular targets of neurosteroid action, the structural details of neurosteroid binding to these proteins remain ill defined. We synthesized neurosteroid analogue photolabeling reagents in which the photolabeling groups were placed at three positions around the neurosteroid ring structure, enabling identification of binding sites and mapping of neurosteroid orientation within these sites. Using middle-down mass spectrometry (MS), we identified three clusters of photolabeled residues representing three distinct neurosteroid binding sites in the human $\alpha$ 1 $\beta$ 3 GABA A receptor. Novel intrasubunit binding sites were identified within the transmembrane helical bundles of both the $\alpha$ 1 (labeled residues $\alpha$ 1 -N 408 , Y 415 ) and $\beta$ 3 (labeled residue $\beta$ 3 -Y 442 ) subunits, adjacent to the extracellular domains (ECDs). An intersubunit site (labeled residues $\beta$ 3 -L 294 and G 308 ) in the interface between the $\beta$ 3 (+) and $\alpha$ 1 (−) subunits of the GABA A receptor pentamer was also identified. Computational docking studies of neurosteroid to the three sites predicted critical residues contributing to neurosteroid interaction with the GABA A receptors. Electrophysiological studies of receptors with mutations based on these predictions ($\alpha$ 1 -V 227 W, N 408 A/Y 411 F, and Q 242 L) indicate that both the $\alpha$ 1 intrasubunit and $\beta$ 3 -$\alpha$ 1 intersubunit sites are critical for neurosteroid action.},

The parameters were then refined with molecular mechanical studies on the structures and energies of model compounds. For nucleic acids, we focused on methyl ethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, deoxyadenosine, dimethyl phosphate, 9-methylguanine-1-methylcytosine hydrogen-bonded complex, 9-methyladenine-1-methylthymine hydrogen-bonded complex, and 1,3-dimethyluracil base-stacked dimer. Bond, angle, torsional, nonbonded, and hydrogen-bond parameters were varied to optimize the agreement between calculated and experimental values for sugar pucker energies and structures, vibrational frequencies of dimethyl phosphate and tetrahydrofuran, and energies for base pairing and base stacking. For proteins, we focused on $\Phi$,$\Psi$ maps of glycyl and alanyl dipeptides, hydrogen-bonding interactions involving the various protein polar groups, and energy refinement calculations on insulin. Unlike the models for hydrogen bonding involving nitrogen and oxygen electron donors, an adequate description of sulfur hydrogen bonding required explicit inclusion of lone pairs. {\textcopyright} 1984 American Chemical Society.},

The parameter evaluation was based on a self-consistent approach designed to achieve a balance between the internal (bonding) and interaction (nonbonding) terms of the force field and among the solvent-solvent, solvent-solute, and solute-solute interactions. Optimization of the internal parameters used experimental gas-phase geometries, vibrational spectra, and torsional energy surfaces supplemented with ab initio results. The peptide backbone bonding parameters were optimized with respect to data for N-methylacetamide and the alanine dipeptide. The interaction parameters, particularly the atomic charges, were determined by fitting ab initio interaction energies and geometries of complexes between water and model compounds that represented the backbone and the various side chains. In addition, dipole moments, experimental heats and free energies of vaporization, solvation and sublimation, molecular volumes, and crystal pressures and structures were used in the optimization. The resulting protein parameters were tested by applying them to noncyclic tripeptide crystals, cyclic peptide crystals, and the proteins crambin, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, and carbonmonoxy myoglobin in vacuo and in crystals. A detailed analysis of the relationship between the alanine dipeptide potential energy surface and calculated protein $\phi$, $\chi$ angles was made and used in optimizing the peptide group torsional parameters. The results demonstrate that use of ab initio structural and energetic data by themselves are not sufficient to obtain an adequate backbone representation for peptides and proteins in solution and in crystals. Extensive comparisons between molecular dynamics simulations and experimental data for polypeptides and proteins were performed for both structural and dynamic properties. Energy minimization and dynamics simulations for crystals demonstrate that the latter are needed to obtain meaningful comparisons with experimental crystal structures. The presented parameters, in combination with the previously published CHARMM all-atom parameters for nucleic acids and lipids, provide a consistent set for condensed-phase simulations of a wide variety of molecules of biological interest.},

The conventional model of H-bonds as sharply directed and saturated bridges between water molecules is incompatible with the behavior of the specific volume, evaporation heat, and self-diffusion and kinematic shear viscosity coefficients of water. On the other hand, it is shown that the variation of the dipole moment of a water molecule and the frequency shift of valence vibrations of a hydroxyl group can be totally explained in the framework of the electrostatic model of H-bond. At the same time, the temperature dependences of the heat capacity of water in the liquid and vapor states clearly testify to the existence of weak H-bonds. The analysis of a water dimer shows that the contribution of weak H-bonds to its ground state energy is approximately 4?5 times lower in comparison with the energy of electrostatic interaction between water molecules. A conclusion is made that H-bonds have the same nature in all other cases where they occur.},

Both ions bind to the H109 residue at the extracellular agonist binding domain. However, whether the H109 residue affects the conformation of the remote channel pore is not yet known. In this study, we focus on the loss-of-function mutation, H109A, and use the inhibitory potencies of six structurally-diverse channel pore blockers (niflumic acid, picrotoxin, bilobalide, ginkgolide A, ginkgolide B and ginkgolide C)with various molecular volumes to measure the H109A mutation's effect on channel pore conformation. We found that their inhibitory potencies were mostly reduced by the H109A mutation and the extents of reduction were positively correlated with the molecular volumes of the blockers. In addition, we also found that the H109A mutation slowed both the blocking and unblocking rates of the blockers. Taken together, we propose that the H109A mutation might “narrow” the channel pore, although other forms of conformational change cannot be excluded. This further provides an implication that the H109 residue might allosterically control the channel pore conformation, and that Zn2+ or H+ binding to this site might also alter the conformation of the channel pore.},

abstract = {The major protective coat of most viruses is a highly symmetric protein capsid that forms spontaneously from many copies of identical proteins. Structural and mechanical properties of such capsids, as well as their self-assembly process, have been studied experimentally and theoretically, including modeling efforts by computer simulations on various scales. Atomistic models include specific details of local protein binding but are limited in system size and accessible time, while coarse grained (CG) models do get access to longer time and length scales but often lack the specific local interactions. Multi-scale models aim at bridging this gap by systematically connecting different levels of resolution. Here, a CG model for CCMV (Cowpea Chlorotic Mottle Virus), a virus with an icosahedral shell of 180 identical protein monomers, is developed, where parameters are derived from atomistic simulations of capsid protein dimers in aqueous solution. In particular, a new method is introduced to combine the MARTINI CG model with a supportive elastic network based on structural fluctuations of individual monomers. In the parametrization process, both network connectivity and strength are optimized. This elastic-network optimized CG model, which solely relies on atomistic data of small units (dimers), is able to correctly predict inter-protein conformational flexibility and properties of larger capsid fragments of 20 and more subunits. Furthermore, it is shown that this CG model reproduces experimental (Atomic Force Microscopy) indentation measurements of the entire viral capsid. Thus it is shown that one obvious goal for hierarchical modeling, namely predicting mechanical properties of larger protein complexes from models that are carefully parametrized on elastic properties of smaller units, is achievable.},

While such fast diffusion implies that different membrane lipids would be laterally randomly distributed, accumulating evidence indicates that in model and natural membranes the lipid components tend to adopt regular (superlattice-like) distributions. The superlattice model, put forward based on such evidence, is intriguing because it predicts that 1) there is a limited number of allowed compositions representing local minima in membrane free energy and 2) those energy minima could provide set-points for enzymes regulating membrane lipid compositions. Furthermore, the existence of a discrete number of allowed compositions could help to maintain organelle identity in the face of rapid inter-organelle membrane traffic. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The instability of cholesterol clusters and the Umbrella effect of cholesterol in dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) lipid bilayers were investigated via atomistic Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation. Cholesterol clusters in phosphatidylcholine (PC) bilayers are found to be very unstable and to readily disperse into cholesterol monomers. This instability results from the difficulty of the bilayer system in preventing water exposure to cholesterol's bulky hydrophobic bodies in a cluster. The system responds to artificially arranged cholesterol clusters in several interesting manners: (i) Cholesterol clusters quickly form a "frustum" shape to reduce water penetration between cholesterol headgroups; (ii) Many clusters bury themselves deeper into the bilayer interior, causing bilayer deformation; (iii) Cholesterol fluctuates rapidly, both laterally and vertically, in order to escape clusters. These fluctuations result in the disintegration of clusters, and in one incidence, a highly unusual flip-flop event of cholesterol across the DOPC bilayer. Our results show that cholesterols have a strong tendency to avoid forming clusters in lipid bilayers and that the fundamental cholesterol-cholesterol interaction is unfavorable. Furthermore, the radial distribution functions of cholesterol hydroxyl oxygen to various headgroup atoms of PC reveal that the PC headgroups surrounding cholesterol have a clear tendency to reorient and to extend toward cholesterol. This reorientation has a layered structure that extends 2 to 3 nm from the cholesterol molecule. This study demonstrates that the Umbrella hypothesis is valid in both saturated and unsaturated lipid bilayers.},

abstract = {The transformation between a gel and a fluid phase in dipalmitoyl- phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers has been simulated using a coarse grained (CG) model by cooling bilayer patches composed of up to 8000 lipids. The critical step in the transformation process is the nucleation of a gel cluster consisting of 20-80 lipids, spanning both monolayers. After the formation of the critical cluster, a fast growth regime is entered. Growth slows when multiple gel domains start interacting, forming a percolating network. Long-lived fluid domains remain trapped and can be metastable on a microsecond time scale. From the temperature dependence of the rate of cluster growth, the line tension of the fluid-gel interface was estimated to be 3±2 pN. The reverse process is observed when heating the gel phase. No evidence is found for a hexatic phase as an intermediate stage of melting. The hysteresis observed in the freezing and melting transformation is found to depend both on the system size and on the time scale of the simulation. Extrapolating to macroscopic length and time scales, the transition temperature for heating and cooling converges to 295±5 K, in semi-quantitative agreement with the experimental value for DPPC (315 K). The phase transformation is associated with a drop in lateral mobility of the lipids by two orders of magnitude, and an increase in the rotational correlation time of the same order of magnitude. The lipid headgroups, however, remain fluid. These observations are in agreement with experimental findings, and show that the nature of the ordered phase obtained with the CG model is indeed a gel rather than a crystalline phase. Simulations performed at different levels of hydration furthermore show that the gel phase is stabilized at low hydration. A simulation of a small DPPC vesicle reveals that curvature has the opposite effect. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Bonded parameters are optimized by comparison to lipid conformations sampled with an atomistic force field, in particular with respect to the representation of the most populated states around the glycosidic linkage. Simulations of coarse-grained glycolipid model membranes show good agreement with atomistic simulations as well as experimental data available, especially concerning structural properties such as electron densities, area per lipid, and membrane thickness. Our coarse-grained model opens the way to large scale simulations of biological processes in which glycolipids are important, including recognition, sorting, and clustering of both external and membrane bound proteins.},

abstract = {A R-positive allosteric modulators (PAMs), whereas alphaxalone and most neuroactive steroids are nAChR inhibitors. In this report, we used 11-(p-azidotetrafluoroben-zoyloxy)allopregnanolone (F 4 N 3 Bzoxy-AP), a general anesthetic and photoreactive allopregnanolone analog that is a potent GABA A R PAM, to characterize steroid-binding sites in the Torpedo 2 nAChR in its native membrane environment. We found that F 4 N 3 Bzoxy-AP (IC 50 31 M) is 7-fold more potent than alphaxalone in inhibiting binding of the channel blocker [ 3 H]tenocyclidine to nAChRs in the desensitized state. At 300 M, neither steroid inhibited binding of [ 3 H]tetra-caine, a closed-state selective channel blocker, or of [ 3 H]acetyl-choline. Photolabeling identified three distinct [ 3 H]F 4 N 3 Bzoxy-AP-binding sites in the nAChR transmembrane domain: 1) in the ion channel, identified by photolabeling in the M2 helices of Val-261 and Val-269 (position M2-13); 2) at the interface between the M1 and M4 helices, identified by photolabeling in M1 (Cys-222/Leu-223); and 3) at the lipid-protein interface involving Trp-453 (M4), a residue photolabeled by small lipophilic probes and promegestone, a steroid nAChR antagonist. Photolabeling in the ion channel and M1 was higher in the nAChR-desensitized state than in the resting state and inhibit-able by promegestone. These results directly indicate a steroid-binding site in the nAChR ion channel and identify additional steroid-binding sites also occupied by other lipophilic nAChR antagonists. Many steroids, including endogenous 3-hydroxy metabo-lites of progesterone and deoxycorticosterone and synthetic analogs, act as potent general anesthetics, sedatives, anxiolytics, or anticonvulsants (1, 2). They are positive allosteric modula-tors (PAMs) 2 of synaptic and extrasynaptic-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA A Rs), anion-selective pentameric ligand-gated channels (pLGICs) (3-5), and negative allosteric modulators of muscle and neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), cation-selective pLGICs (6-8). The complex effects of steroid PAMs on GABA A R gating and the locations of residues identified by mutational analyses as steroid sensitivity determinants suggest the existence of multiple ste-roid-binding sites in the transmembrane domain (TMD) of het-eromeric GABA A Rs (9, 10). Recent crystal structures of chime-ric homopentameric receptors containing GABA A R subunit TMDs identify a binding site for steroid PAMs in the TMD at subunit interfaces (11, 12), which is distinct from the intersub-unit sites in the extracellular third of the TMD for etomidate, propofol, and barbiturates identified in heteromeric GABA A Rs by photolabeling and mutational analyses (13, 14). A distinct intrasubunit site for pregnenolone sulfate, an inhibitory ste-roid, was also identified in a chimeric homomeric receptor TMD (11). For muscle-type nAChRs, single-channel analyses of the acute effects of natural and synthetic steroids indicate a reduction of open channel lifetime (15-17), but it is not known whether this results from steroid binding within the ion channel or indirectly as a consequence of interactions at the lipid interface. As cholesterol is present in high concentrations in synaptic membranes and is important for facilitating agonist-induced conformational transitions, inhibition by steroids may result from perturbation of nAChR-cholesterol interactions (18-20). Mutations of some amino acids in the M4 helices that are exposed at the lipid interface have as large an effect on channel gating as the substitutions at channel-lining residues (21, 22). Also, substitutions at a position in M4 exposed at the lipid interface reduced hydrocortisone potency (23).

Monte Carlo simulations (including species exchange moves for efficient sampling) reveal a variety of mixing behaviors in binary systems. Two species are identified that maintain stable, randomly mixed fluid membranes at vanishing tension over all possible binary compositions. The thermal and elastic properties of membranes formed by these lipids are characterized over the full composition range. Equilibrium area at constant tension is nonmonotonic with respect to composition, but consistent with that of a quadratic mixture. In the constant tension ensemble, the bending rigidity of the bilayer is minimized at an intermediate composition. The observed functional form of bending rigidity vs composition is fit to a simple expression motivated by linear elasticity theory; this expression accounts for membrane heterogeneity through a single parameter.},

Clearly, the proteins embedded within the various components of the cell envelope have an intricate relationship with their local environment. Therefore, to obtain meaningful results, molecular simulations need to mimic as far as possible this chemically heterogeneous system. However, setting up such systems for computational studies is far from trivial, and consequently the vast majority of simulations of outer membrane proteins still rely on oversimplified phospholipid membrane models. This work presents an update of CHARMM-GUI Martini Maker for coarse-grained modeling and simulation of complex bacterial membranes with lipopolysaccharides. The qualities of the outer membrane systems generated by Martini Maker are validated by simulating them in bilayer, vesicle, nanodisc, and micelle environments (with and without outer membrane proteins) using the Martini force field.

abstract = {Caulobacter crescentus adapts to phosphate starvation by elongating its cell body and a polar stalk structure. The stalk is an extension of the Gram-negative envelope containing inner and outer membranes as well as a peptidoglycan cell wall. Cellular elongation requires a 6- to 7-fold increase in membrane synthesis, yet phosphate limitation would preclude the incorporation of additional phospholipids. In the place of phospholipids, C. crescentus can synthesize several glycolipid species, including a novel glycosphingolipid (GSL-2). While glycosphingolipids are ubiquitous in eukaryotes, the presence of GSL-2 in C. crescentus is surprising since GSLs had previously been found only in Sphingomonas species, in which they play a role in outer membrane integrity. In this paper, we identify three proteins required for GSL-2 synthesis: CcbF catalyzes the first step in ceramide synthesis, while Sgt1 and Sgt2 sequentially glycosylate ceramides to produce GSL-2. Unlike in Sphingomonas , GSLs are nonessential in C. crescentus ; however, the presence of ceramides does contribute to phage resistance and susceptibility to the cationic antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B. The identification of a novel lipid species specifically produced upon phosphate starvation suggests that bacteria may be able to synthesize a wider variety of lipids in response to stresses than previously observed. Uncovering these lipids and their functional relevance will provide greater insight into microbial physiology and environmental adaptation. IMPORTANCE Bacteria adapt to environmental changes in a variety of ways, including altering their cell shape. Caulobacter crescentus adapts to phosphate starvation by elongating its cell body and a polar stalk structure containing both inner and outer membranes. While we generally think of cellular membranes being composed largely of phospholipids, cellular elongation occurs when environmental phosphate, and therefore phospholipid synthesis, is limited. In order to adapt to these environmental constraints, C. crescentus synthesizes several glycolipid species, including a novel glycosphingolipid. This finding is significant because glycosphingolipids, while ubiquitous in eukaryotes, are extremely rare in bacteria. In this paper, we identify three proteins required for GSL-2 synthesis and demonstrate that they contribute to phage resistance. These findings suggest that bacteria may synthesize a wider variety of lipids in response to stresses than previously observed.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 American Chemical Society. For molecular dynamics simulations of biological membrane systems to live up to the potential of providing accurate atomic level detail into membrane properties and functions, it is essential that the force fields used to model such systems are as accurate as possible. One membrane property that is often used to assess force field accuracy is the carbon-hydrogen (or carbon-deuterium) order parameters of the lipid tails, which can be accurately measured using experimental NMR techniques. There are a variety of analysis tools available to calculate these order parameters from simulations and it is essential that these computational tools work correctly to ensure the accurate assessment of the simulation force fields. In this work we compare many of these computational tools for calculating the order parameters of POPC membranes. While tools that work on all-Atom systems and tools that work on saturated lipid tails in general work extremely well, we demonstrate that the majority of the tested tools that calculate the order parameters for unsaturated united-Atom lipid tails do so incorrectly. We identify tools that do perform accurate calculations and include one such program with this work, enabling rapid and accurate calculation of united-Atom lipid order parameters. Furthermore, we discuss cases in which it is nontrivial to appropriately predict the unsaturated carbon order parameters in united-Atom systems. Finally, we examine order parameter splitting for carbon 2 in sn-2 lipid chains, demonstrating substantial deviations from experimental values in several all-Atom and united-Atom lipid force fields.},

abstract = {In adult animals, the cerebellum is richly innervated by serotonin: serotonergic fibres are the third main afferent fibres into the cerebellum. However, the physiology of the serotonergic system and its functional significance are not fully known during development in the cerebellum. In this review we will focus on the serotonergic regulation of the cerebellum during postnatal development. We hypothesize a powerful role for serotonin in the physiology of the developing cerebellum. A presumably tonic activation of serotonin receptors by binding of serotonin becomes specific by temporally and spatially restricted expression of different serotonin receptors, each with their own (sometimes antagonizing) functions. During the first postnatal week, activation of 5-HT1 receptors expressed by both granule cells and Purkinje cells stimulates dendritic growth and synapse formation. Later, activation of 5-HT3 receptors expressed by granule cells limits dendritic growth of Purkinje cells via mediating the secretion of reelin, influences physiological maturation of Purkinje cells, modulates synaptic plasticity at parallel fibre-Purkinje cell synapses and thereby affects competition with the climbing fibres on Purkinje cell dendrites resulting in proper climbing fibre elimination. Last, activation of 5-HT2 receptors expressed by granule cells and Purkinje cells both during late postnatal development and in the mature cerebellum promotes the stability of synaptic activity. Thus, we propose that serotonin controls cerebellar development in three phases: (1) stimulation of dendritic growth and formation of synapses, (2) hard-wiring of neuronal connections with limits to dendritic growth but ensuring synaptic plasticity, and (3) stabilization of synapses. Taken together, serotonin receptors expressed by different cells in the cerebellum have a specialized role during postnatal development, but with some similar main effects. Distinct spatial and temporal expression of these receptors gives serotonin a powerful and specific role in cerebellar development. {\textcopyright} 2013 IBRO.},

abstract = {In the adult nervous system, neurotransmitters act as chemical mediators of intercellular communication by the activation of specific receptors and second messengers in postsynaptic cells. This specialized role may have evolved from more primitive functions in lower organisms where these substances were used as both intra- and intercellular signalling devices. This view derives from the finding that a number of 'classical' neurotransmitters are present in primitive organisms and early embryos in the absence of a nervous system, and pharmacological evidence that these substances regulate morphogenetic activities such as proliferation, differentiation, cell motility and metamorphosis. These phylogenetically old functions may be reiterated in the developing nervous system and in the humoral functions of neurotransmitters outside the nervous system. This review will provide evidence for this hypothesis based on the commonality of signal transduction mechanisms used in primitive organisms, early embryos and non-neuronal cells, and relate these relationships to the functions of neurotransmitters in the developing nervous system.

abstract = {RATIONALE The irreversible oxidation of biological molecules, such as lipids, can be achieved with a photosensitizing agent and subsequent exposure to light, in the presence of molecular oxygen. Although lipid peroxidation is an important toxicity mechanism in bacteria, the alterations caused by the photodynamic therapy on bacterial phospholipids are still unknown. In this work, we studied the photodynamic oxidation of Escherichia coli membrane phospholipids using a lipidomic approach. METHODS E. coli ATCC 25922 were irradiated for 90 min with white light (4 mW cm-2, 21.6 J cm -2) in the presence of a tricationic porphyrin [(5,10,15-tris(1- methylpyridinium-4-yl)-20-(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin triiodide, Tri-Py +-Me-PF]. Lipids were extracted and separated by thin-layer chromatography. Phospholipid classes were quantified by phosphorus assay and analyzed by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Fatty acids were analyzed by gas chromatography. Quantification of lipid hydroperoxides was performed by FOX2 assay. Analysis of the photodynamic oxidation of a phospholipid standard was also performed. RESULTS Our approach allowed us to see that the photodynamic treatment induced the formation of a high amount of lipid hydroperoxides in the E. coli lipid extract. Quantification of fatty acids revealed a decrease in the unsaturated C16:1 and C18:1 species suggesting that oxidative modifications were responsible for their variation. It was also observed that photosensitization induced the oxidation of phosphatidylethanolamines with C16:1, C18:1 and C18:2 fatty acyl chains, with formation of hydroxy and hydroperoxy derivatives. CONCLUSIONS Membrane phospholipids of E. coli are molecular targets of the photodynamic effect induced by Tri-Py+-Me-PF. The overall change in the relative amount of unsaturated fatty acids and the formation of PE hydroxides and hydroperoxides evidence the damages in bacterial phospholipids caused by this lethal treatment.

abstract = {Nerotopin-3 (NT-3) has low-affinty (Kd = 8 x 10-10 M), as well as high-affinity receptors (Kd = 1.8 x 10-11 M) on embryonic chick sensory neurons, the latter in surprisingly high numbers. Like the structurally related proteins nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), NT-3 also binds to the low-affinity NGF receptor, a molecule that we suggest to designate low-affinity neurotrophin receptor (LANR). NT-3 dissociates from the LANR much more rapidly than BDNF, and more slowly than NGF. The binding of labelled NT-3 to the LANR can be reduced by half using a concentration of BDNF corresponding to the Kd of BDNF to the LANR. In contrast, the binding of NT-3 to its high-affinity neuronal receptors can only be prevented by BDNF or NGF when used at concentrations several thousand-fold higher than those corresponding to their Kd to their high-affinity neuronal receptors. Thus, specific high-affinity NT-3 receptors exist on sensory neurons that can readily discriminate between three structurally related ligands. These findings, including the remarkable property of the LANR to bind three related ligands with similar affinity, but different rate constants, are discussed.},

Recent studies show that NMDAR-induced responses depend on the receptor location: stimulation of synaptic NMDARs, acting primarily through nuclear Ca(2+) signalling, leads to the build-up of a neuroprotective 'shield', whereas stimulation of extrasynaptic NMDARs promotes cell death. These differences result from the activation of distinct genomic programmes and from opposing actions on intracellular signalling pathways. Perturbations in the balance between synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDAR activity contribute to neuronal dysfunction in acute ischaemia and Huntington's disease, and could be a common theme in the aetiology of neurodegenerative diseases. Neuroprotective therapies should aim to both enhance the effect of synaptic activity and disrupt extrasynaptic NMDAR-dependent death signalling.},

This was done by measuring flux, streaming potential, and protein transmission during filtration of bovine serum albumin (BSA) solutions at various pH values using various membranes with different cut-off values. It was found that protein-membrane interactions influence the fouling behaviour in the initial stages of filtration. In the high-fouling regime (later stages of filtration), protein-protein interactions dictate the overall performance. AFM images of the membrane surfaces taken after the filtration experiments showed that the membranes were totally covered by a protein fouling layer. The structure of this fouling layer depended strongly on pH. In particular, very open structures with high permeabilities were found at low pH (below the iso-electric point of the protein). These induced high values of flux and protein transmission. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Muscular dystrophies are among the most common human genetic diseases and are characterized by progressive muscle degeneration. Muscular dystrophies result from genetic defects in components of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC), a multimeric complex found in the muscle cell plasma membrane. The DGC links the intracellular cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix and is thought to be important for maintaining the mechanical integrity of muscles and organizing signalling molecules. The exact role of the DGC in the pathogenesis of disease has, however, remained uncertain. Mutations in Caenorhabditis elegans DGC genes lead to specific defects in coordinated movement and can also cause muscle degeneration. Here we show that mutations in the gene snf-6 result in phenotypes indistinguishable from those of the DGC mutants, and that snf-6 encodes a novel acetylcholine/choline transporter. SNF-6 mediates the uptake of acetylcholine at neuromuscular junctions during periods of increased synaptic activity. SNF-6 also interacts with the DGC, and mutations in DGC genes cause a loss of SNF-6 at neuromuscular junctions. Improper clearing of acetylcholine and prolonged excitation of muscles might contribute to the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophies.},

abstract = {Ionic channels are gated aqueous pores whose conformational changes are driven by the electric field in the membrane. Gating may be studied by three electrical methods: ionic current transients, ionic current fluctuations, and "gating current," and probably occurs through a series of conformational changes in the channel leading to an all-or-nothing opening of the pore. When the potential is held constant, the gating steps come to equilibrium rather than reaching an energy-dissipating, cyclic steady state. The kinetic models now in use eventually need to be changed to correct disagreements with several recent studies. Diffusion of ions through open channels is very fast but involves many interactions of ions, pore, and solvent that lead to ionic selectivity, saturation, block, and flux coupling. Our description of the ionic fluxes can be improved by abandoning continuum models in favor of more structured ones. Problems to be solved include determining how many ions occupy a channel at once and what to be solved include determining how many ions occupy a channel at once and what kind of energy barriers they must cross in traversing the membrane. Ultimately we will need to know the chemical structure of the whole system to understand how it functions. {\textcopyright} 1978, The Biophysical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Phase inversion refers to a phenomenon that occurs when agitated oil in water emulsion, reverts to a water in oil and vice versa. Emulsification via phase inversion is widely used in fabrication of cosmetic products, pharmaceutical products (e.g., vesicles for drug delivery), foodstuff and detergents. Emulsification process is strongly affected by preparation method; very different droplet size distribution could be achieved, which is strictly linked to the product stability. Phase inversion process leads to the formation of finely dispersed droplets in a continuous phase. In this work an experimental investigation of phase inversion emulsification to produce stable samples has been performed. The emulsion morphology has been characterized in detail by direct observation via optical and confocal microscopy.},

abstract = {Formation of oil-in-water nano-emulsions has been studied in the water/C12E4/isohexadecane system by the phase inversion temperature emulsification method. Emulsification started at the corresponding hydrophilic-lipophilic balance temperature, and then the samples were quickly cooled to 25 degrees C. The influence of phase behavior on nano-emulsion droplet size and stability has been studied. Droplet size was determined by dynamic light scattering, and nano-emulsion stability was assessed, measuring the variation of droplet size as a function of time. The results obtained showed that the smallest droplet sizes were produced in samples where the emulsification started in a bicontinuous microemulsion (D) phase region or in a two-phase region consisting of a microemulsion (D) and a liquid crystalline phase (L(alpha)). Although the breakdown process of nano-emulsions could be attributed to the oil transference from the smaller to the bigger droplets, the increase in instability found with the increase in surfactant concentration may be related to the higher surfactant excess, favoring the oil micellar transport between the emulsion droplets.},

abstract = {Beta-carotene is a carotenoid with a wide spectrum of biological activities (e.g., anti-cancer, anti-hypertensive, and anti-inflammatory). However, because of its extremely high hydrophobicity, it is difficult to incorporate in food formulations and its bioavailability is fairly low. Lipid-based encapsulation colloidal systems such as lipid nanoparticles can help overcome these issues. In this study, beta-carotene-loaded lipid nanoparticles were produced by the phase inversion temperature (PIT) method from 10{\%} cupuacu butter and 20{\%} surfactant (Cremophor RH40 and Span 80). The inversion temperature of the nanoparticles was 74 °C and their average diameter was 35 nm. After 100 days of storage, 85{\%} of the initial amount of beta-carotene remained in the nanoparticles; alpha-tocopherol was found to be essential for carotenoid preservation. Comparison of the results of in vitro digestion between static and dynamic systems was performed, and the characteristics of each digestion system led to diverse results in terms of average particle size and beta-carotene bioaccessibility. Although the static system was much simpler than the dynamic system, it could not provide reliable data of the digestibility of the lipid nanoparticles. The bioaccessibility of beta-carotene in the static system was 92{\%}, very similar to the results found in the literature; by comparison, the dynamic system revealed a beta-carotene bioaccessibility of nearly 20{\%}. Despite this discrepancy, the highly realistic conditions of digestion simulated by the dynamic in vitro system indicate that the results of this system are more reliable than those obtained from the simplified static system applied in this research.},

abstract = {ATR-FTIR spectroscopy is useful in investigating the lateral organization of Stratum corneum (SC) lipids in full-thickness skin. Based on studies of the thermotropic phase transitions in n-tricosane and in excised human skin, the temperature dependence of the CH 2 scissoring bandwidth emerged as a measure of the extent of orthorhombic and hexagonal phases. This dependence provides a simpler measure of the lateral order in lipid assemblies than the common spectroscopic approaches based on difference spectra, curve fitting of the CH 2 scissoring region, and the position of the CH 2 stretching vibrations. It has the advantages of ease of determination, relatively low variability, and high discriminative power for the type of lateral intermolecular chain packing. A comparison of the lateral organization of the lipids at the SC surface of mammalian skin using the scissoring bandwidth revealed considerable differences between human abdominal skin (containing mostly orthorhombic phases), porcine ear skin (containing mostly hexagonal phases), and reconstructed human epidermis (containing mostly disordered phases). This parameter also correctly described the different effects of propylene glycol (minimally disturbing) and oleic acid (formation of a highly disordered phase) on the SC lipids in excised human skin. The procedure described here is applicable to in vivo studies in the areas of dermatology, transdermal drug delivery, and skin biophysics. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Cellular membranes and associated proteins play critical physiological roles in organisms from all life kingdoms. In many cases, malfunction of biological membranes triggered by changes in the lipid bilayer properties or membrane protein functional abnormalities lead to severe diseases. To understand in detail the processes that govern the life of cells and to control diseases, one of the major tasks in biological sciences is to learn how the membrane proteins function. To do so, a variety of biochemical and biophysical approaches have been used in molecular studies of membrane protein structure and function on the nanoscale. This review focuses on electron paramagnetic resonance with site-directed nitroxide spin-labeling (SDSL EPR), which is a rapidly expanding and powerful technique reporting on the local protein/ spin-label dynamics and on large functionally important structural rearrangements. On the other hand, adequate to nanoscale study membrane mimetics have been developed and used in conjunction with SDSL EPR. Primarily, these mimetics include various liposomes, bicelles, and nanodiscs. This review provides a basic description of the EPR methods, continuous-wave and pulse, applied to spin-labeled proteins, and highlights several representative applications of EPR to liposome-, bicelle-, or nano-disc-reconstituted membrane proteins.},

abstract = {General anesthetics exert their effects on the central nervous system by acting on ion channels, most notably pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. Although numerous studies have focused on pentameric ligand-gated ion channels, the details of anesthetic binding and channel modulation are still debated. A better understanding of the anesthetic mechanism of action is necessary for the development of safer and more efficacious drugs. Herein, we present a computational study identifying two anesthetic binding sites in the transmembrane domain of the Gloeobacter violaceus ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC) channel, characterize the putative binding pathway, and observe structural changes associated with channel function. Molecular simulations of desflurane reveal a binding pathway to GLIC via a membrane-embedded tunnel using an intrasubunit protein lumen as the conduit, an observation that explains the Meyer-Overton hypothesis, or why the lipophilicity of an anesthetic and its potency are generally proportional. Moreover, employing high concentrations of ligand led to the identification of a second transmembrane site (TM2) that inhibits dissociation of anesthetic from the TM1 site and is consistent with the high concentrations of anesthetics required to achieve clinical effects. Finally, asymmetric binding patterns of anesthetic to the channel were found to promote an iris-like conformational change that constricts and dehydrates the ion pore, creating a 13.5 kcal/ mol barrier to ion translocation. Together with previous studies, the simulations presented herein demonstrate a novel anesthetic binding site in GLIC that is accessed through a membrane embedded tunnel and interacts with a previously known site, resulting in conformational changes that produce a non-conductive state of the channel.},

abstract = {Although transmembrane helix-helix interactions must be strong enough to drive folding, they must still permit the inter-helix movements associated with conformational change. Interactions between the outermost M4 and adjacent M1 and M3 $\alpha$-helices of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels have been implicated in folding and function. Here, we evaluate the role of different physical interactions at this interface in the function of two prokaryotic homologs, GLIC and ELIC. Strikingly, disruption of most interactions in GLIC lead to either a reduction or a complete loss of expression and/or function, while analogous disruptions in ELIC often lead to gains in function. Structural comparisons suggest that GLIC and ELIC represent distinct transmembrane domain archetypes. One archetype, exemplified by GLIC, the glycine and GABA receptors and the glutamate activated chloride channel, has extensive aromatic contacts that govern M4-M1/M3 interactions and that are essential for expression and function. The other archetype, exemplified by ELIC and both the nicotinic acetylcholine and serotonin receptors, has relatively few aromatic contacts that are detrimental to function. These archetypes likely have evolved different mechanisms to balance the need for strong M4 "binding" to M1/M3 to promote folding/ expression, and the need for weaker interactions that allow for greater conformational flexibility. The folding of transmembrane proteins occurs via two stages 1. First, independently stable transmembrane $\alpha$-helices are released into the membrane bilayer by the translocon machinery. Second, independently formed $\alpha$-helices associate with each other to form higher order structures, which in turn create environments that can drive further insertions of the polypeptide chain and/or promote the binding of prosthetic groups within the nas-cent protein core 2. With the muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), appropriate transmembrane helix-helix associations are also required to mask an endoplasmic reticulum retention motif and thus to signal that the mature receptor is ready to traffic to the cell surface 3. In the absence of effective helix-helix associations, the immature form remains in the endoplasmic reticulum and is targeted for degradation. Transmembrane proteins, such as the nAChR and other pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs), must strike a balance between strong helix-helix associations that drive folding of the transmembrane domain (TMD) and weaker associations that facilitate inter-helix movements associated with protein conformational change 4, 5. This balance may also impact on the functional sensitivity of pLGICs to the many allosteric modu-lators that act on their TMDs 6-12. For example, the outermost M4 $\alpha$-helix in the TMD of each nAChR subunit influences channel function 13-19. M4 likely influences function through its associations with the adjacent trans-membrane $\alpha$-helices, M1 and M3 20, 21. While effective M4-M1/M3 interactions are required to drive protein folding ultimately leading to expression on the cell surface 22 , intrinsically strong interactions reduce, while weaker interactions enhance functional sensitivity to both the surrounding lipid environment and the potentiating effects of a disease-causing M4 lipid-facing tryptophan substitution 23-25. In other words, a more malleable M4-M1/M3 interface leads to greater functional sensitivity to altered lipid-protein interactions. Aromatic interactions are thought to play a key energetic role driving M4 associations with M1 and M3 22, 23. Aromatic interactions between M4 and M1/M3 are abundant in GLIC, but less so in ELIC and the nAChR (Fig. 1) 26-28. In fact, the level of aromatic interactions at this interface varies substantially from one pLGIC sub-unit to another, leading to the hypothesis that different subunits exhibit different intrinsic strengths of M4-M1/},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer ScienceCBusiness Media Dordrecht 2014. Protein function is a complicated interplay between structure and dynamics, which can be heavily influenced by environmental factors and conditions. This is particularly true in the case of membrane proteins, such as the visual receptor rhodopsin. It has been well documented that lipid headgroups, polyunsaturated tails, and the concentration of cholesterol in membranes all play a role in the function of rhodopsin. Recently, we used all-atom simulations to demonstrate that different lipid species have preferential interactions and possible binding sites on rhodopsin's surface, consistent with experiment. However, the limited timescales of the simulations meant that the statistical uncertainty of these results was substantial. Accordingly, we present here 32 independent 1.6{\_}s coarse-grained simulations exploring lipids and cholesterols surrounding rhodopsin and opsin, in lipid bilayers mimicking those found naturally. Our results agree with those found experimentally and in previous simulations, but with far better statistical certainty. The results demonstrate the value of combining all-atom and coarse-grained models with experiment to provide a well-rounded view of lipid-protein interactions.},

abstract = {Carbon nanotube porins embedded in lipid membranes are studied by molecular dynamics simulations.Artificial channels made of carbon nanotube (CNT) porins are promising candidates for applications in filtration and molecular delivery devices. Their symmetric shape and high mechanical, chemical, and thermal stability ensure well-defined transport properties, and at the same time make them ideal model systems for more complicated membrane protein pores. As the technology to produce and tune CNTs advances, simulations can aid in the design of customized membrane porins. Here we concentrate on CNTs embedded in lipid membranes. To derive design guidelines, we systematically studied the interaction of CNT porins with their surrounding lipids. For our simulations, we developed an AMBER- and Lipid14-compatible parameterization scheme for CNTs with different chirality and with functional groups attached to their rim, and a flexible coarse-grained description for open-ended CNTs fitting to the MARTINI lipid model. We found that the interaction with lipid acyl chains is independent of the CNT chirality and the chemical details of functional groups at the CNT rims. The latter, however, are important for the interactions with lipid head groups, and for water permeability. The orientation and permeability of the pore are mainly determined by how well its hydrophobicity pattern matches the membrane. By identifying the factors that determine the structure both of isolated CNTs in lipid membranes and of CNT clusters, we set the foundation for a targeted design of CNT–membrane systems.},

It was found that a combination of negatively-charged heads and saturation of hydrocarbon tails is dominant for the stability of membrane phase separation. Phase separation in lipid bilayers that include negatively charged lipids is examined experimentally. We observed phase-separated structures and determined the membrane miscibility temperatures in several binary and ternary lipid mixtures of unsaturated neutral lipid, dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), saturated neutral lipid, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), unsaturated charged lipid, dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG (−) ), saturated charged lipid, dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (DPPG (−) ), and cholesterol. In binary mixtures of saturated and unsaturated charged lipids, the combination of the charged head with the saturation of the hydrocarbon tail is a dominant factor in the stability of membrane phase separation. DPPG (−) enhances phase separation, while DOPG (−) suppresses it. Furthermore, the addition of DPPG (−) to a binary mixture of DPPC/cholesterol induces phase separation between DPPG (−) -rich and cholesterol-rich phases. This indicates that cholesterol localization depends strongly on the electric charge on the hydrophilic head group rather than on the ordering of the hydrocarbon tails. Finally, when DPPG (−) was added to a neutral ternary system of DOPC/DPPC/cholesterol (a conventional model of membrane rafts), a three-phase coexistence was produced. We conclude by discussing some qualitative features of the phase behaviour in charged membranes using a free energy approach.},

Several definitions have been proposed, each of which has arbitrary features. When applied to mixtures of cholesterol and DPPC, these definitions give different results. This note recalls that physical chemistry provides a canonical way to define molecular area, in analogy to the definition of partial-specific volume. Results for partial-specific area are obtained from simulations of DPPC/cholesterol bilayers and compared to the results from the other recent definitions. The partial-specific-area formalism dramatically demonstrates the condensing effect of cholesterol and this leads to the introduction of a specific model that accounts for the area of mixtures of cholesterol and lipid over the entire range of cholesterol concentrations. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Deuterium (2H) NMR spectroscopy provides detailed information regarding the structural fluctuations of lipid bilayers, including both the equilibrium properties and dynamics. Experimental 2H NMR measurements for the homologous series of 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholines with perdeuterated saturated chains (from C12:0 to C18:0) have been performed on randomly oriented, fully hydrated multilamellar samples. For each lipid, the C-D bond order parameters have been calculated from de-Paked 2H NMR spectra as a function of temperature. The experimental order parameters were analyzed using a mean-torque potential model for the acyl chain segment distributions, and comparison was made with the conventional diamond lattice approach. Statistical mechanical principles were used to relate the measured order parameters to the lipid bilayer structural parameters: the hydrocarbon thickness and the mean interfacial area per lipid. At fixed temperature, the area decreases with increasing acyl length, indicating increased van der Waals attraction for longer lipid chains. However, the main effect of increasing the acyl chain length is on the hydrocarbon thickness rather than on the area per lipid. Expansion coefficients of the structural parameters are reported and interpreted using an empirical free energy function that describes the force balance in fluid bilayers. At the same absolute temperature, the phosphatidylcholine (PC) series exhibits a universal chain packing profile that differs from that of phosphatidylethanolamines (PE). Hence, the lateral packing of phospholipids is more sensitive to the headgroup methylation than to the acyl chain length. A fit to the area per lipid for the PC series using the empirical free energy function shows that the PE area represents a limiting value for the packing of fluid acyl chains.},

abstract = {The principles of organization and functioning of cellular membranes are currently not well understood. The raft hypothesis suggests the existence of domains or rafts in cell membranes, which behave as protein and lipid platforms. They have a functional role in important cellular processes, like protein sorting or cell signaling, among others. Theoretical work suggests that the interfacial energy at the domain edge, also known as line tension, is a key parameter determining the distribution of domain sizes, but there is little evidence of how line tension affects membrane organization. We have investigated the effects of the line tension on the formation and stability of liquid ordered domains in model lipid bilayers with raft-like composition by means of time-lapse confocal microscopy coupled to atomic force microscopy. We varied the hydrophobic mismatch between the two phases, and consequently the line tension, by modifying the thickness of the disordered phase with phosphatidylcholines of different acyl chain length. The temperature of domain formation, the dynamics of domain growth, and the distribution of domain sizes depend strongly on the thickness difference between the domains and the surrounding membrane, which is related to line tension. When considering line tension calculated from a theoretical model, our results revealed a linear increase of the temperature of domain formation and domain growth rate with line tension. Domain budding was also shown to depend on height mismatch. Our experiments contribute significantly to our knowledge of the physical-chemical parameters that control membrane organization. Importantly, the general trends observed can be extended to cellular membranes.},

abstract = {Hydration and fluidity of lipid bilayers in different phase states were studied using fluorescent probes selectively located at the interface. The probe of hydration was a recently developed 3-hydroxyflavone derivative, which is highly sensitive to the environment, whereas the probe of fluidity was the diphenylhexatriene derivative, 1-[4-(trimethylamino)phenyl]-6-phenylhexa-1,3,5- triene. By variation of the cholesterol content and temperature in large unilamellar vesicles composed of sphingomyelin or dipalmitoylphosphatidlycholine, we generated different phases: gel, liquid ordered (raft), liquid crystalline, and liquid disordered (considered as liquid crystalline phase with cholesterol). For these four phases, the hydration increases in the following order: liquid ordered ≪ gel ≈ liquid disordered {\textless} liquid crystalline. The membrane fluidity shows a somewhat different trend, namely liquid ordered ≈ gel {\textless} liquid disordered {\textless} liquid crystalline. Thus, gel and liquid ordered phases exhibit similar fluidity, whereas the last phase is significantly less hydrated. We expect that cholesterol due to its specific H-bonding interactions with lipids and its ability to fill the voids in lipid bilayers expels efficiently water molecules from the highly ordered gel phase to form the liquid ordered phase. In this study, the liquid ordered (raft) and gel phases are for the first time clearly distinguished by their strong difference in hydration. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Changes in the internal energy of lipids with temperature are related to both lipid volume and area changes. Close to the chain melting transition of lipid bilayers volume and enthalpy fluctuations generally follow proportional functions. This makes it possible to calculate the relationship between membrane excess heat capacity with lipid volume, area compressibility and the membrane bending modulus, if the area fluctuations of the two monolayers are assumed to be mainly decoupled. Thus, compressibility and elasticity display pronounced maxima at the chain melting transition. These maxima can also be related to pronounced minima of the sound velocity in the lipid transition range, which were found in ultrasonic experiments. In the present study heat capacity profiles and volume changes were obtained. The compressibilities and the bending modulus were then deduced from the specific heat. The relevance of these findings for structural transitions and for the curvature dependence of heat capacities is discussed. Copyright (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Thus Bernal (1933) when discussing the different types of arrangements of molecules in liquid crystals commented ‘Such structures belong to the liquid crystal as a unit and not to its molecules which may be replaced by others without destroying them and they persist in spite of the complete fluidity of the substance. These are just the properties to be required for a degree of organization between that of the continuous substance, liquid or crystalline solid and even the simplest living cell.' Stewart (1961) some thirty years later also stated that ‘It is this property – the combination of flow and lability with a preferred and relatively stable molecular orientation – that makes the mesomorphic (i.e. liquid crystal) phase uniquely appropriate to the structure of protoplasm and living tissue.'},

abstract = {Ordered --{\textgreater} fluid phase transitions in bilayers of charged lipids are accompanied by a decrease in electrostatic free energy mainly as a result of bilayer expansion. For uniform charge distribution the Gouy-Chapman theory of the electrical double layer predicts a decrease of the transition temperature with increasing charge density. We studied the effects of pH and mono- and divalent cations on the phase transition of lecithin, cephalin, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidic acid bilayers. Phosphatidic acid with two ionizable protons was selected for a systematic investigation. A change in pH from 7 to 9 increases the charge per polar group from one to two elementary charges. This lowers the transition temperature by about 20 degrees C in agreement with the theory. In this pH region rather small changes in pH suffice to induce the phase transition at constant temperature. Divalent cations (Mg(++) and Ca(++)) increase the transition temperature by charge neutralization and thus can be used to induce the fluid --{\textgreater} ordered transition at constant temperature. In contrast, monovalent cations (Li(+), Na(+), K(+)) lower the transition temperature, or fluidize the bilayer structure at a given temperature. Rather small changes in ionic environment can induce gross alterations in bilayer structure; divalent and monovalent cations have antagonistic effects. This result parallels current theories on nerve excitation and sensory transduction where cation-induced structural changes in biomembranes are invoked.},

abstract = {The maximum molar ratio of lecithin:cholesterol in aqueous dispersions has been reported to be 2:1, 1:1, or 1:2. The source of the desparate results has been examined in this study by analyzing (a) the phase relations in anhydrous mixtures (from which most dispersions are prepared) and (b) various methods of preparing aqueous dispersions, with the purpose of avoiding the formation of metastable states that may be responsible for the variability of the lecithin-cholesterol stoichiometry. Temperature-composition phase diagrams for anhydrous mixtures of cholesterol (CHOL) with dimyristoyl (DML) and with dipalmitoyl (DPL) lecithin were obtained by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Complexes form with molar ratios for lecithin:CHOL of 2:1 and 1:2; they are stable up to 70°C. When x(CHOL) {\textless} 0.33, two phases coexist: complex (2:1) plus pure lecithin; when 0.33 {\textless}x(CHOL) {\textless} 0.67 complexes (2:1) and (1:2) coexist as separate phases. The corresponding phase diagram in water for these mixtures was determined by DSC and isopycnic centrifugation in D2O-H2O gradients. Aqueous dispersions were prepared by various methods (vortexing, dialysis, sonication) yielding identical results except as noted below. The data presented supports the following phase relations. When x(CHOL) {\textless} 0.33, two lipid phases coexist: pure lecithin plus complex (2:1) where the properties of the lecithin phase are determined by whether the temperature is below or above Tc, the gel-liquid crystal transition temperature. Therefore, complex (2:1) will coexist with gel state below Tc and with liquid crystal above Tc. The densities follow in the order gel {\textgreater} complex (2:1) {\textgreater} liquid crystal. The density of complex (2:1) is less sensitive to temperature in the range 5°-45°C compared to the temperature dependence for DML and DPL where large changes in density occur at Tc. When x(CHOL) {\textgreater} 0.33, CHOL phase coexists with complex (2:1); anhydrous complex (1:2) is apparently not stable in H2O. The results are independent of the method and temperature used for preparing the lipid dispersions. However, when dispersions are prepared by sonication or with solvents at T {\textgreater}Tc, an apparent 1:1 complex is formed. Evidence suggests the 1:1 complex is metastable. {\textcopyright} 1978, The Biophysical Society. All rights reserved.},

@article{Papahadjopoulos1973,
abstract = {We have studied the solid to liquid-crystalline phase transition of sonicated vesicles of dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine. The transition was studied by both fluorescence polarization of perylene embedded in the vesicles, and by the efflux rate of trapped 22Na+. Fluorescence polarization generally decreases with temperature, showing an inflection in the region 32-42°C with a mid-point of approximately 37.5 °C. On the other hand, the perylene fluorescence intensity increases abruptly in this region. To explain this result, we have proposed that, for T {\textless} Tc where Tc is the transition temperature, perylene is excluded from the hydrocarbon interior of the membranes, whereas, T {\textless} Tc this probe may be accommodated in the membrane interior to a large extent. The self-diffusion rates of 22Na+ through dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol vesicles exhibit a complex dependence on temperature. There is an initial large increase in diffusion rates (approximately 100-fold) between 30 and 38 °C, followed by a decrease (approximately 4-fold) between 38 and 48 °C. A monotonic increase is then observed at temperatures higher than 48 °C. The local maximum of 22Na+ self-diffusion rates at approximately 38 °C coincides with the mid-point of phase transition as detected by changes in fluorescence polarization of perylene with the same vesicles. Vesicles composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine show the same general behavior in terms of 22Na+ self-diffusion rates at different temperatures, except that the local maximum occurs at approximately 42 °C. The temperature dependence of the permeability and the appearance of a local maximum at the phase transition region could be explained in terms of a domain structure within the plane of the membranes. This explanation is based on the possibility that boundary regions between liquid and solid domains would exhibit relatively high permeability to 22Na+. Mixed vesicles composed of equimolar amounts of dipalmitoyl phospholipids and cholesterol show no abrupt changes in the temperature dependence of either perylene fluorescence polarization or 22Na+ diffusion rate measurements. This is taken to indicate the absence of agross phase transition in the presence of cholesterol. {\textcopyright} 1973.},

abstract = {Synaptic communication is a dynamic process that is key to the regulation of neuronal excit-ability and information processing in the brain. To date, however, the molecular signals controlling synaptic dynamics have been poorly understood. Membrane-derived bioactive phospholipids are potential candidates to control short-term tuning of synaptic signaling, a plastic event essential for information processing at both the cellular and neuronal network levels in the brain. Here, we showed that phospholipids affect excitatory and inhibitory neu-rotransmission by different degrees, loci, and mechanisms of action. Signaling triggered by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) evoked rapid and reversible depression of excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents. At excitatory synapses, LPA-induced depression depended on LPA 1 /G $\alpha$i/o-protein/phospholipase C/myosin light chain kinase cascade at the presynaptic site. LPA increased myosin light chain phosphorylation, which is known to trigger actomyosin contraction, and reduced the number of synaptic vesicles docked to active zones in excitatory boutons. At inhibitory synapses, postsynaptic LPA signaling led to de-phosphorylation, and internalization of the GABA A$\gamma$2 subunit through the LPA 1 /G $\alpha$12/13-pro-tein/RhoA/Rho kinase/calcineurin pathway. However, LPA-induced depression of GABAergic transmission was correlated with an endocytosis-independent reduction of GABA A receptors, possibly by GABA A$\gamma$2 dephosphorylation and subsequent increased lateral diffusion. Furthermore, endogenous LPA signaling, mainly via LPA 1 , mediated activity-dependent inhibitory depression in a model of experimental synaptic plasticity. Finally, LPA signaling, most likely restraining the excitatory drive incoming to motoneurons, regulated performance of motor output commands, a basic brain processing task. We propose that lysophospholipids serve as potential local messengers that tune synaptic strength to precedent activity of the neuron. Neuronal networks are modules of synaptic connectivity that underlie all brain functions, from simple reflexes to complex cognitive processes. Synaptic plasticity allows these networks to adapt to changing external and internal environments. Membrane-derived bioac-tive phospholipids are potential candidates to control short-term synaptic plasticity. We demonstrate that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), an important intermediary in lipid metabolism , depresses the main excitatory and inhibitory synaptic systems by different mechanisms. LPA depresses inhibitory synaptic transmission by reducing the number of postsynaptic receptors at inhibitory synapses; whereas it depresses excitatory synaptic transmission by decreasing the size of the ready-to-use synaptic vesicle pool at excitatory terminals. Finally, we demonstrate that LPA signaling contributes to the performance of motor output commands in adult animals. Our data documents that synaptic strength and neuronal activity are modulated by products of membrane phospholipid metabolism, which suggests that bioactive phospholipids are candidates in coupling brain function to the metabolic status of the organism.},

Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and Single particle tracking (SPT) are presented in that order. FRAP and FCS methodologies are described for a dedicated wide field microscope although many confocal microscopes now have software permitting these measurement to be made; nevertheless, the principles of the measurement are the same for a wide field or confocal microscope. SPT can be applied to trace the movements of single fluorescent molecules in membranes but this aspect will not be treated in detail. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Lateral diffusion of lipids in biological membranes may be influenced by polypeptides, proteins, and other nonlipid membrane constituents. Using concepts from scaled-particle theory, we extend the free-volume model for lipid diffusion to membranes having an arbitrarily large number of components. This theory clarifies the interpretation of the free-volume theory, better reproduces the free-area dependence of lipid lateral diffusion rates, and quantitatively predicts the experimental observation that the lateral diffusion rates of membrane lipids are significantly reduced when proteins or polypeptides are incorporated in the membrane. Rapid lateral diffusion of lipids in pure monolayer or bilayer systems is well described by "jump" or "hopping" models based on the free-volume diffusion theory of Cohen and Turnbull (1-4). In this model, first applied to biomembrane systems by Galla et al. (5), diffusion is considered to be a three-step process in which first a local free volume into which a molecule may diffuse is created by equilibrium density fluctuations, then the diffusing molecule "jumps" into the void, and, finally, another solvent molecule fills the hole created by this diffusional "jump." Although the results of this model agree well with experiments for a number of systems (5-7), the theory is not applicable to complex systems in which the solvent consists of many species having different molecular dimensions. As a result, it cannot be directly applied to membrane systems in which the membrane contains nonlipid species, such as proteins. To describe such systems, Saxton (8) applied effective-medium and continuum-percolation theories. Effective-medium theory is usually used to estimate the electrical conductivity of a composite material in which particles of one conductivity are embedded within a medium of another conductivity. Because effective-medium theory relies on the solution of self-consistency equations for the electric field within the medium, with which we are not concerned in molecular diffusion, its a priori applicability to lipid diffusion is not obvious. The theory predicts total immobilization of diffusing molecules when impermeable domains exceed 50{\%} of the membrane area, and it predicts a linear reduction of diffusion rate with increasing area fraction of impermeable domains below this point. This threshold is different than that predicted by percolation theory. Percolation theory predicts that at a certain critical permeable area there will be a sudden increase in the conductivity of the membrane and thus of observed diffusion rates. In the vicinity of this critical area the conductivity change shows a power-law dependence; further from this critical area the power-law expression is inappropriate, necessitating another theory, such as the effective-medium theory. The percolation limit depends on the size and shape of diffusing molecules but differs from the limit obtained by effective-medium theory. To reconcile the theories, Saxton constructs an interpolating polynomial that matches the results of effective-medium theory for infinitely dilute impermeable domains and the results of continuum-percolation theory when impermeable domains occupy 23.2{\%} of the membrane. Although this hybrid theory predicts a decrease in the apparent lipid lateral-diffusion constant when impermeable domains, such as proteins, are present in the membrane, it apparently does not correctly predict the magnitude of the reduction (7). In this paper I develop a model of lipid diffusion that is based on the free-volume concept. Lateral density fluctuations are treated using a modified scaled-particle theory (9), however, allowing the incorporation of many species of different sizes. When applied to a single-component system, this theory provides insight into the physical interpretation of the phenomenological constant in the original Cohen-Turn-bull diffusion theory. In addition, the theory accounts for the reduction of lipid lateral-diffusion rates observed when poly-peptides and proteins are incorporated into membranes. Theory We assume that diffusion takes place via the free-volume mechanism (1-5) in three steps: (i) a hole is created in the solvent via lateral density fluctuations; (ii) a diffusing molecule jumps into this hole from an adjoining site; and (iii) the resulting void is filled by diffusion of a solvent molecule. We further assume that the membrane may be approximated by a two-dimensional collection of randomly distributed hard disks. In the spirit of Cohen and Turnbull (1), the average diffusion coefficient is given by D = fD(R)P(R)dR, R* [1] where P(R) is the probability of finding a circular region of the membrane with radius between R and R + dR that does not contain any molecules, and R* is the radius of the smallest hole into which a lipid molecule can diffuse. The probability of finding such a region is given by P(R) = exp[-W(R)/kT], [2] where W(R) is the work required to create a hole of radius R in the solvent, T is the absolute temperature, and k is Boltzmann's constant. Because we have assumed that membrane lipids and proteins may be approximated by randomly distributed hard disks, we may obtain W(R) from scaled-particle theory (9).

abstract = {We demonstrate critical behavior in giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs) that are isolated directly from living cells. GPMVs contain two liquid phases at low temperatures and one liquid phase at high temperatures and exhibit transition temperatures in the range of 15 to 25 degrees C. In the two-phase region, line tensions linearly approach zero as temperature is increased to the transition. In the one-phase region, micrometer-scale composition fluctuations occur and become increasingly large and long-lived as temperature is decreased to the transition. These results indicate proximity to a critical point and are quantitatively consistent with established theory. Our observations of robust critical fluctuations suggest that the compositions of mammalian plasma membranes are tuned to reside near a miscibility critical point and that heterogeneity corresponding to {\textless} 50 nm-sized compositional fluctuations are present in GPMV membranes at physiological temperatures. Our results provide new insights for plasma membrane heterogeneity that may be related to functional lipid raft domains in live cells.},

abstract = {We present molecular dynamics simulations of a multicomponent, asymmetric bilayer in mixed aqueous solutions of sodium and potassium chloride. Because of the geometry of the system, there are two aqueous solution regions in our simulations: one mimics the intracellular region, and one mimics the extracellular region. Ion-specific effects are evident at the membrane/aqueous solution interface. Namely, at equal concentrations of sodium and potassium, sodium ions are more strongly adsorbed to carbonyl groups of the lipid headgroups. A significant concentration excess of potassium is needed for this ion to overwhelm the sodium abundance at the membrane. Ion-membrane interactions also lead to concentration-dependent and cation-specific behavior of the electrostatic potential in the intracellular region because of the negative charge on the inner leaflet. In addition, water permeation across the membrane was observed on a timescale of ∼100 ns. This study represents a step toward the modeling of realistic biological membranes at physiological conditions in intracellular and extracellular environments. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Exosomes are small vesicles secreted from multivesicular bodies, which are able to stimulate the immune system leading to tumour cell eradication. We have analysed lipids of exosomes secreted either upon stimulation from rat mast cells (RBL-2H3 cells), or constitutively from human dendritic cells. As compared with parent cells, exosomes displayed an enrichment in sphingomyelin, but not in cholesterol. Phosphatidylcholine content was decreased, but an enrichment was noted in disaturated molecular species as in phosphatidylethanolamines. Lyso(bis)phosphatidic acid was not enriched in exosomes as compared with cells. Fluorescence anisotropy demonstrated an increase in exosome-membrane rigidity from pH 5 to 7, suggesting their membrane reorganization between the acidic multivesicular body compartment and the neutral outer cell medium. NMR analysis established a bilayer organization of exosome membrane, and ESR studies using 16-doxyl stearic acid demonstrated a higher flip-flop of lipids between the two leaflets as compared with plasma membrane. In addition, the exosome membrane exhibited no asymmetrical distribution of phosphatidylethanolamines. Therefore exosome membrane displays a similar content of the major phospholipids and cholesterol, and is organized as a lipid bilayer with a random distribution of phosphatidylethanolamines. In addition, we observed tight lipid packing at neutral pH and a rapid flip-flop between the two leaflets of exosome membranes. These parameters could be used as a hallmark of exosomes.},

abstract = {Mammalian cells produce hundreds of dynamically regulated lipid species that are actively turned over and trafficked to produce functional membranes. These lipid repertoires are susceptible to perturbations from dietary sources, with potentially profound physiological consequences. However, neither the lipid repertoires of various cellular membranes , their modulation by dietary fats, nor their effects on cellular phenotypes have been widely explored. We report that differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into osteoblasts or adipocytes results in extensive re-modeling of the plasma membrane (PM), producing cell-specific membrane compositions and biophysical properties. The distinct features of osteoblast PMs enabled rational engineering of membrane phenotypes to modulate differentiation in MSCs. Specifically, supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a lipid component characteristic of osteoblast membranes, induced broad lipidomic remodeling in MSCs that reproduced compositional and structural aspects of the osteoblastic PM phenotype. The PM changes induced by DHA supplementation potentiated osteogenic differentiation of MSCs concurrent with enhanced Akt activation at the PM. These observations prompt a model wherein the DHA-induced lipidome leads to more stable membrane microdomains, which serve to increase Akt activity and thereby enhance osteogenic differentiation. More broadly, our investigations suggest a general mechanism by which dietary fats affect cellular physiology through remodeling of membrane lipidomes, biophysical properties, and signaling.},

abstract = {Patterned two-photon (2P) photolysis via holographic illumination is a powerful method to investigate neuronal function because of its capability to emulate multiple synaptic inputs in three dimensions (3D) simultaneously. However, like any optical system, holographic projectors have a finite space-bandwidth product that restricts the spatial range of patterned illumination or field-of-view (FOV) for a desired resolution. Such trade-off between holo-graphic FOV and resolution restricts the coverage within a limited domain of the neuron's dendritic tree to perform highly resolved patterned 2P photolysis on individual spines. Here, we integrate a holographic projector into a commercial 2P galvanometer-based 2D scanning microscope with an uncaging unit and extend the accessible holographic FOV by using the galvanometer scanning mirrors to reposition the holographic FOV arbitrarily across the imaging FOV. The projector system utilizes the microscope's built-in imaging functions. Stimulation positions can be selected from within an acquired 3D image stack (the volume-of-interest, VOI) and the holographic projector then generates 3D illumination patterns with multiple uncaging foci. The imaging FOV of our system is 800×800 $\mu$m 2 within which a holo-graphic VOI of 70×70×70 $\mu$m 3 can be chosen at arbitrary positions and also moved during experiments without moving the sample. We describe the design and alignment protocol as well as the custom software plugin that controls the 3D positioning of stimulation sites. We demonstrate the neurobiological application of the system by simultaneously uncaging glu-tamate at multiple spines within dendritic domains and consequently observing summation of postsynaptic potentials at the soma, eventually resulting in action potentials. At the same time, it is possible to perform two-photon Ca 2+ imaging in 2D in the dendrite and thus to monitor synaptic Ca 2+ entry in selected spines and also local regenerative events such as den-dritic action potentials.

abstract = {Line tension is a determinant of fluid phase domain formation kinetics and morphology in lipid bilayer membranes, which are models for biological membrane heterogeneity. We describe the first direct measurement of this line tension by micropipette aspiration. Our data are analyzed with a model that does not rely on independently measured (and composition dependent) secondary parameters, such as bending stiffness or membrane viscosities. Line tension is strongly composition dependent and decreases towards a critical consolute point in a quasiternary room temperature phase diagram. It has been suggested that biomembrane domains, often termed rafts, play important roles in cellular membrane function [1,2]. Biological membrane fluid phase coexistence can be experimentally modeled via liquid disordered (L d) and liquid ordered (L o) phases in membranes self-assembled from synthetic or natural purified lipids. Line tension at the domain phase boundary controls the kinetics of phase separation and domain sizes. In vivo, line tension could be an essential control parameter for regulation of lateral compartmentalized membrane-localized signaling complexes. Lipid bilayer line tensions can be divided into those that are measured at a bilayer membrane edge (membrane pore) and those that are found at the domain boundary of phase separated but otherwise continuous membranes. These edge tensions were determined both experimentally [3-5] and theoretically [6], with values near 10 pN. Recently, shape analysis of giant unilamellar vesicles yielded rough line tension estimates for fluid-fluid phase coexistence in the range of 1 pN [7,8]. Approximate line tension values were obtained by determining dimension-less fit parameters through comparison of model membrane shapes and computed shapes using theory developed by Juelicher and Lipowsky [9]. Rescaling of these fit parameters with vesicle dimension and literature value estimates of bending stiffness allowed determining lateral tensions, bending stiffness differences, and line tension in vesicles with fluid phase coexistence [7,8]. The problem with generalizing this approach is that bending stiffness and other mechanical properties depend on the composition of coexisting phases, which are thus far only known for selected average compositions [10,11]. Also, to our knowledge, no attempts have yet been made to measure absolute values of bending stiffness in domains of phase separated lipid membranes. In principle, domain shape relaxation of equilibrium or nonequilibrium shape fluctuations can be used to measure fluid domain boundary line tension [12]. However, membrane domain viscosities, which are strongly composition dependent (see, e.g., [13]) and would have to be measured independently, influence relaxation kinetics [12].},

abstract = {Atomic resolution and coarse-grained simulations of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine lipid bilayers were analyzed for fluctuations perpendicular to the bilayer using a completely Fourier-based method. We find that the fluctuation spectrum of motions perpendicular to the bilayer can be decomposed into just two parts: 1), a pure undulation spectrum proportional to q-4that dominates in the small-q regime; and 2), a molecular density structure factor contribution that dominates in the large-q regime. There is no need for a term proportional to q-2that has been postulated for protrusion fluctuations and that appeared to have been necessary to fit the spectrum for intermediate q. We suggest that earlier reports of such a term were due to the artifact of binning and smoothing in real space before obtaining the Fourier spectrum. The observability of an intermediate protrusion regime from the fluctuation spectrum is discussed based on measured and calculated material constants. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the Biophysical Society.},

Here we present the origin of Helfrich model within the context of the general Gibbs theory of capillary interfaces, and review the strategies of computing the membrane elastic moduli based on considering a lipid monolayer as a three-dimensional thick layer characterized by trans-monolayer profiles of elastic parameters. We present the results of original computations of these profiles by a state-of-the-art numerical approach. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Gaussian curvature modulus $\kappa$ of lipid bilayers likely contributes more than 100 kcal/mol to every cellular fission or fusion event. This huge impact on membrane remodeling energetics might be a factor that codetermines the complex lipid composition of biomembranes through tuning of $\kappa$. Yet, its value has been measured only for a handful of simple lipids, and no simulation has so far determined it better than a factor of two, rendering a systematic investigation of such enticing speculations impossible. Here we propose a highly accurate method to determine $\kappa$ in computer simulations. It relies on the interplay between curvature stress and edge tension of partially curved axisymmetric membrane disks and requires determining their closing probability. For a simplified lipid model we obtain $\kappa$ and its relation to the normal bending modulus $\kappa$ for membranes differing both in stiffness and spontaneous lipid curvature. The elastic ratio $\kappa$/$\kappa$ can be determined with a few percent statistical accuracy. Its value agrees with the scarce experimental data, and its change with spontaneous lipid curvature is compatible with theoretical expectations, thereby granting additional information on monolayer properties. We also show that an alternative determination of these elastic parameters based on moments of the lateral stress profile gives markedly different and unphysical values. {\textcopyright} 2012 Biophysical Society.},

[Biophys. J., 2012, 102, 1403] to the MARTINI representation of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC). We find the value (k) over bar /k = -1.04 +/- 0.03 for the elastic ratio between the Gaussian and the mean curvature modulus and deduce (k) over bar (m)/k(m) approximate to -0.98 +/- 0.09 for the monolayer elastic ratio, where the latter is based on plausible assumptions for the distance z(0) of the monolayer neutral surface from the bilayer midplane and the spontaneous lipid curvature K-0m. By also analyzing the lateral stress profile sigma(0)(z) of our system, two other lipid types and pertinent data from the literature, we show that determining K-0m and (k) over bar through the first and second moment of sigma(0)(z) gives rise to physically implausible values for these observables. This discrepancy, which we previously observed for a much simpler CG model, suggests that the moment conditions derived from simple continuum assumptions miss the effect of physically important correlations in the lipid bilayer.},

When the coupling between membrane composition and curvature is strong enough, the nearby membrane composition and shape both undergo a transition from overdamped to underdamped spatial variation, well before the membrane becomes unstable in the bulk. This transition is associated with a change in the sign of the thermodynamic energy and, hence, favors the early stages of coat assembly necessary for vesiculation (budding) and may suppress the activity of mechanosensitive membrane channels and transporters. Our results suggest an approach to obtain physical parameters of the membrane that are otherwise difficult to measure.},

The computational study of the interaction between charged, ligand-protected metal nanoparticles and model lipid membranes has been recently addressed at both atomistic and coarse-grained levels. Here we compare the performance of three versions of the coarse-grained Martini force field at describing the nanoparticle-membrane interaction. The three coarse-grained models differ in terms of treatment of long-range electrostatic interactions and water polarizability. The NP-membrane interaction consists of the transition from a metastable NP-membrane complex, in which the NP is only partially embedded in the membrane, to a configuration in which the NP is anchored to both membrane leaflets. All three of the coarse-grained models provide a description of the metastable NP-membrane complex that is consistent with that obtained using an atomistic force field. As for the anchoring transition, the polarizable-water Martini correctly describes the molecular mechanisms and the energetics of the transition. The standard version of the Martini model, instead, underestimates the free-energy barriers for anchoring and does not completely capture the membrane deformations involved in the transition process.},

@article{Barrantes2010a,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer ScienceBusiness Media B.V. 2010. Cholesterol is an essential partner of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR). It is not only an abundant component of the postsynaptic membrane but also affects the stability of the receptor protein in the membrane, its supramolecular organization and function. In the absence of innervation, early on in ontogenetic development of the muscle cell, embryonic AChRs occur in the form of diffusely dispersed molecules. At embryonic day 13, receptors organize in the form of small aggregates. This organization can be mimicked in mammalian cells in culture. Trafficking to the plasmalemma is a cholesterol-dependent process. Receptors acquire association with the sterol as early as the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. Once AChRs reach the cell surface, their stability is also highly dependent on cholesterol levels. Acute cholesterol depletion reduces the number of receptor domains by accelerating the rate of endocytosis. In muscle cells, AChRs are internalized via a recently discovered dynamin- and clathrin-independent, cytoskeleton-dependent endocytic mechanism. Unlike other endocytic pathways, cholesterol depletion accelerates internalization and re-routes AChR endocytosis to an Arf6-dependent pathway. Cholesterol depletion also results in ion channel gain-of-function of the remaining cell-surface AChRs, whereas cholesterol enrichment has the opposite effect. Wide-field microscopy shows AChR clusters as diffraction-limited puncta of ∼200 nm diameter. Stimulated emission depletion (STED) fluorescence microscopy resolves these puncta into nanoclusters with an average diameter of ∼55 nm. Exploiting the enhanced resolution, the effect of acute cholesterol depletion can be shown to alter the short- and long-range organization of AChR nanoclusters. In the short range, AChRs form bigger nanoclusters. On larger scales (0.5–3.5 $\mu$m) nanocluster distribution becomes non-random, attributable to the cholesterol-related abolition of cytoskeletal physical barriers normally preventing the lateral diffusion of AChR nanoclusters. The dependence of AChR numbers at the cell surface on membrane cholesterol raises the possibility that cholesterol depletion leads to AChR conformational changes that alter its stability and its long-range dynamic association with other AChR nanoclusters, accelerate its endocytosis, and transiently affect the channel kinetics of those receptors remaining at the surface. Cholesterol content at the plasmalemma may thus homeostatically modulate AChR dynamics, cell-surface organization and lifetime of receptor nanodomains, and fine tune the ion permeation process.},

abstract = {Purified nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) protein was reconstituted into synthetic lipid membranes having known effects on receptor function in the presence and absence of cholesterol (Chol). The phase behavior of a lipid system (DPPC/DOPC) possessing a known lipid phase profile and favoring nonfunctional, desensitized AChR was compared with that of a lipid system (POPA/POPC) containing the anionic phospholipid phosphatidic acid (PA), which stabilizes the functional resting form of the AChR. Fluorescence quenching of diphenylhexatriene (DPH) extrinsic fluorescence and AChR intrinsic fluorescence by a nitroxide spin-labeled phospholipid showed that the AChR diminishes the degree of DPH quenching and promotes DPPC lateral segregation into an ordered lipid domain, an effect that was potentiated by Chol. Fluorescence anisotropy of the probe DPH increased in the presence of AChR or Chol and also made apparent shifts to higher values in the transition temperature of the lipid system in the presence of Chol and/or AChR. The values were highest when both Chol and AChR were present, further reinforcing the view that their effect on lipid segregation is additive. These results can be accounted for by the increase in the size of quencher-free, ordered lipid domains induced by AChR and/or Chol. Pyrene phosphatidylcholine (PyPC) excimer (E) formation was strongly reduced owing to the restricted diffusion of the probe induced by the AChR protein. The analysis of Forster energy transfer (FRET) from the protein to DPH further indicates that AChR partitions preferentially into these ordered lipid microdomains, enriched in saturated lipid (DPPC or POPA), which segregate from liquid phase-enriched DOPC or POPC domains. Taken together, the results suggest that the AChR organizes its immediate microenvironment in the form of microdomains with higher lateral packing density and rigidity. The relative size of such microdomains depends not only on the phospholipid polar headgroup and fatty acyl chain saturation but also on AChR protein-lipid interactions. Additional evidence suggests a possible competition between Chol and POPA for the same binding sites on the AChR protein.},

However, the underlying signaling mechanisms remain poorly defined. We show that agrin stimulates a dynamic translocation of the AChR into lipid rafts-cholesterol and sphingolipid-rich microdomains in the plasma membrane. This follows MuSK partition into lipid rafts and requires its activation. Disruption of lipid rafts inhibits MuSK activation and downstream signaling and AChR clustering in response to agrin. Rapsyn, an intracellular protein necessary for AChR clustering, is located constitutively in lipid rafts, but its interaction with the AChR is inhibited when lipid rafts are perturbed. These results reveal that lipid rafts may regulate AChR clustering by facilitating the agrin/MuSK signaling and the interaction between the receptor and rapsyn, both necessary for AChR clustering and maintenance. These results provide insight into mechanisms of AChR cluster formation.},

abstract = {Emerging concepts of membrane organization point to the compartmentalization of the plasma membrane into distinct lipid microdomains. This lateral segregation within cellular membranes is based on cholesterol-sphingolipid-enriched microdomains or lipid rafts which can move laterally and assemble into large-scale domains to create plasma membrane specialized cellular structures at specific cell locations. Such domains are likely involved in the genesis of the postsynaptic specialization at the neuromuscular junction, which requires the accumulation of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), through activation of the muscle specific kinase MuSK by the neurotropic factor agrin and the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. We used C2C12 myotubes as a model system to investigate whether agrin-elicited AChR clustering correlated with lipid rafts. In a previous study, using two-photon Laurdan confocal imaging, we showed that agrin-induced AChR clusters corresponded to condensed membrane domains: the biophysical hallmark of lipid rafts [F. Stetzkowski-Marden, K. Gaus, M. Recouvreur, A. Cartaud, J. Cartaud, Agrin elicits membrane condensation at sites of acetylcholine receptor clusters in C2C12 myotubes, J. Lipid Res. 47 (2006) 2121-2133]. We further demonstrated that formation and stability of AChR clusters depend on cholesterol. We also reported that three different extraction procedures (Triton X-100, pH 11 or isotonic Ca++, Mg++ buffer) generated detergent resistant membranes (DRMs) with similar cholesterol/GM1 ganglioside content, which are enriched in several signalling postsynaptic components, notably AChR, the agrin receptor MuSK, rapsyn and syntrophin. Upon agrin engagement, actin and actin-nucleation factors such as Arp2/3 and N-WASP were transiently recovered within raft fractions suggesting that the activation by agrin can trigger actin polymerization. Taken together, the present data suggest that AChR clustering at the neuromuscular junction relies upon a mechanism of raft coalescence driven by agrin-elicited actin polymerization. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The nAChR alpha 7-subunit has a property of high Ca2+ permeability and may have specific functions and localization within the plasma membrane as a signal transduction molecule. In PC-12 cells, fractionation by sucrose gradient centrifugation revealed that nAChR alpha 7 existed in low-density, cholesterol-enriched plasma membrane microdomains known as lipid rafts where flotillin also exists. In contrast, nAChR alpha 5- and beta2-subunits were located in high-density fractions, out of the lipid rafts. Type 6 adenylyl cyclase (AC6), a calcium-inhibitable isoform, was also found in lipid rafts and was coimmunoprecipitated with nAChR alpha 7. Cholesterol depletion from plasma membranes with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin redistributed nAChR alpha 7 and AC6 diffusely within plasma membranes. Nicotine stimulation reduced forskolin-stimulated AC activity by 35{\%}, and this inhibition was negated by either treatment with alpha-bungarotoxin, a specific antagonist of nAChR alpha 7, or cholesterol depletion from plasma membranes. The effect of cholesterol depletion was negated by the addition of cholesterol. These data suggest that nAChR alpha 7 has a specific membrane localization relative to other nAChR subunits and that lipid rafts are necessary to localize nAChR alpha 7 with AC within plasma membranes. In addition, nAChR alpha 7 may regulate the AC activity via Ca2+ within lipid rafts.},

abstract = {The 43 kDa receptor-associated protein rapsyn is a myristoylated peripheral protein that plays a central role in nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering at the neuromuscular junction. In a previous study, we demonstrated that rapsyn is specifically cotransported with AChR via post-Golgi vesicles targeted to the innervated surface of the Torpedo electrocyte (Marchand et al., 2000). In the present study, to further elucidate the mechanisms for sorting and assembly of postsynaptic proteins, we analyzed the dynamics of the intracellular trafficking of fluorescently labeled rapsyn in the transient-expressing COS-7 cell system. Our approach was based on fluorescence, time-lapse imaging, and immunoelectron microscopies, as well as biochemical analyses. We report that newly synthesized rapsyn associates with the trans-Golgi network compartment and traffics via vesiculotubular organelles toward the cell surface of COS-7 cells. The targeting of rapsyn organelles appeared to be mediated by a microtubule-dependent transport. Using cotransfection experiments of rapsyn and AChR, we observed that these two molecules codistribute within distal exocytic routes and at the plasma membrane. Triton X-100 extraction on ice and flotation gradient centrifugation demonstrated that rapsyn and AChR are recovered in low-density fractions enriched in two rafts markers: caveolin-1 and flotillin-1. We propose that sorting and targeting of these two companion molecules are mediated by association with cholesterol-sphingolipid-enriched raft microdomains. Collectively, these data highlight rapsyn as an itinerant vesicular protein that may play a dynamic role in the sorting and targeting of its companion receptor to the postsynaptic membrane. These data also raise the interesting hypothesis of the participation of the raft machinery in the targeting of signaling molecules to synaptic sites.},

The topography of the pyrene-labeled Cys residues with respect to the membrane and the apparent affinity for representative lipids were determined by differential fluorescence quenching with spin-labeled derivatives of fatty acids, phosphatidylcholine, and the steroids cholestane and androstane. Different spin label lipid analogs exhibit different selectivity for the whole AChR protein and its transmembrane domains. In all cases labeled residues were found to lie in a shallow position. For M4 segments, this is compatible with a linear alpha-helical structure, but not so for M1, for which "classical" models locate Cys residues at the center of the hydrophobic stretch. The transmembrane topography of M1 can be rationalized on the basis of the presence of a substantial amount of non-helical structure, and/or of kinks attributable to the occurrence of the evolutionarily conserved proline residues. The latter is a striking feature of M1 in the AChR and all members of the rapid ligand-gated ion channel superfamily.},

abstract = {Calcium-permeable neurotransmitter receptors are concentrated into structurally and biochemically isolated cellular compartments to localize calcium-mediated events during neurotransmission. The cytoplasmic membrane contains lipid microdomains called lipid rafts, which can gather into microscopically visible clusters, and thus the association of a particular protein with lipid rafts can result in its redistribution on the cell surface. The present study asks whether lipid rafts participate in the formation and maintenance of the calcium-permeable alpha7-subunit nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7nAChR) clusters found in somatic spines of ciliary neurons. Lipid rafts and alpha7nAChR become progressively colocalized within somatic spines during synaptogenesis. To determine whether these rafts are required for the maintenance of alpha7nAChR aggregates, cholesterol was extracted from dissociated ciliary neurons by treatment with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin. This treatment caused the dispersion of lipid rafts and the redistribution of alpha7nAChR into small clusters over the cell surface, suggesting that the integrity of lipid rafts is required to maintain the receptor clustering. However, lipid raft dispersion also caused the depolymerization of the F-actin cytoskeleton, which can also tether the receptor at specific sites. To assess whether interaction between rafts and alpha7nAChR is independent of F-actin filaments, the lipid raft patches were stabilized with a combination of the cholera toxin B subunit (CTX), which specifically binds to the raft component ganglioside GM1, and an antibody against CTX. The stabilized rafts were then treated with latrunculin-A to depolymerize F-actin. Under these conditions, large patches of CTX persisted and were colocalized with alpha7nAChR, indicating that the aggregates of receptors can be maintained independently of the underlying F-actin cytoskeleton. Moreover, it was found that the alpha7nAChR is resistant to detergent extraction at 4 degrees C and floats with the caveolin-containing lipid-rich fraction during density gradient centrifugation, properties that are consistent with a direct association between the receptor and the membrane microdomains.},

abstract = {Coarse-grained (CG) models allow enlarging the size and time scales that are reachable by atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. A CG force field (FF) for lipids and amino acids that possesses a polarizable water model has been developed following the MARTINI parametrization strategy, the BMW-MARTINI [1]. We tested the BMW-MARTINI FF capability to describe some structural and thermodynamical properties of lipid monolayers and bilayers. We found that, since the surface tension values of oil/water interfaces calculated with the model are not correct, compression isotherms of lipid monolayers present artifacts. Also, this FF predicts DPPC and DAPC bilayers to remain in the L$\alpha$phase at temperatures as low as 283 K, contrary to the expected from their experimental Tm values. Finally, simulations at constant temperature of bilayers of saturated lipids belonging to PC homologous, showed an increase in the mean molecular area (Mma) upon increasing the chain length, inversely to the experimental observation. We refined BMW-MARTINI FF by modifying as few parameters as possible in order to bring simulated and experimental measurements closer. We have also modified structural parameters of the lipid geometry that do not have direct influence in global properties of the bilayer membranes or monolayers, but serve to approach the obtained CG geometry to atomistic reference values. The refined FF is able to better reproduce phase transition temperatures and Mma for saturated PC bilayers than BMW-MARTINI and MARTINI FF. Finally, the simulated surface pressure-Mma isotherms of PC monolayers resemble the experimental ones and eliminate serious artifacts of previous models.},

abstract = {microscopy (28). TX100 selectively solubilized l d-phase domains, leaving the l o-phase domains relatively unchanged as DRMs. Both of these approaches showed that TX100 did not substantially change the relative amounts of membrane in the two phases. By contrast, using calorimetry, Heerklotz and colleagues reported that TX100 can induce phase separation in previously uniform mixtures (45, 46). However, results of the other two studies described above suggest that any such effect may be relatively minor. Development of the raft model in cells These model membrane results initially suggested that DRMs isolated from cells were also derived from preexisting raft domains. This model was attractive because plasma membranes contain significant amounts of order-preferring sphingolipids and sterols, together with disorder-preferring phospho-lipids. Model membrane studies showed that l o-l d phase separation could occur at 37°C in lipid mixtures with physiological levels of each of these lipid classes, making phase separation in cell membrane plausible (1, 101). Furthermore, DRMs isolated from cells are enriched in a subset of proteins, mostly from the plasma membrane. DRM enrichment initially suggested that these proteins were concentrated in rafts in cells and that raft targeting might be important in function. This idea was supported by the use of agents that deplete or sequester membrane cholesterol.-Cyclodextrins can rapidly and reversibly extract most sterol from cell membranes (25). Polyene antibiotics such as filipin and nystatin partition into membranes and bind sterols, sequestering them from other interactions. For convenience, I will refer to both classes of compound together as cholesterol modulators. These agents reduce or abolish DRM association of most proteins, suggesting that they disrupt rafts in cells. This idea is reasonable, since phase separation is often enhanced by sterols (1, 102) and could plausibly be abolished by sterol removal. (It is worth noting, however, that l o-phase disruption by cholesterol mod-ulators has not been demonstrated directly using detergent-free assays in model membrane systems.) 430 1548-9213/05 8.00 {\textcopyright}2006 Int. Union Physiol. Sci./Am. Physiol. Soc. The liquid-ordered (l o) phase is a sterol-dependent state in which lipid acyl chains are tightly packed and highly extended but in which individual lipid molecules have a high degree of lateral diffusion in the bilayer (109). In model membranes, l o-phase domains can coexist with both liquid-disordered (l d)-phase domains, in which lipids are much less condensed, and with gel-phase domains, in which lipids are highly condensed and essentially immobile (44). l o-l d phase separation in model membranes is not controversial: micron-sized l o-phase domains can be seen by microscopy in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) (109). The raft hypothesis proposes that l o-phase domains also form in sterol-rich cell membranes, especially the plasma membrane, where they coexist with disordered membrane domains (42, 61, 82). Detergent Insolubility and Lipid Rafts An important early indication that rafts may exist in cells came from the observation that cell membranes are not fully solubilized by non-ionic detergents such as Triton X-100 (TX100) or CHAPS at low temperatures. Instead, l o-phase DRMs remain and can be isolated on sucrose gradients (15, 95). Detergent insolubility in model membranes Model membrane studies explained this finding, showing that close packing of lipids in the l o or gel phases prevents detergent incorporation into the bilayer (115). Two studies showed that detergent insolubility is a useful assay of phase state in model membranes. In one, the phase state of a series of sterol-rich mixtures containing varying amounts of order-and disorder-preferring lipids was first determined by a fluorescence-quenching assay (1). This pinpointed the amount of order-preferring lipid required for phase separation. The same mixtures were then subjected to TX100 extraction. DRMs could only be detected in mixtures that contained l o-phase domains before the addition of TX100 (1). A second approach used two-phase supported lipid bilayers that contained separate l d and l o domains visible by Lipid rafts are liquid-ordered (l o) phase microdomains proposed to exist in biological membranes. Rafts have been widely studied by isolating l o-phase detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) from cells. Recent findings have shown that DRMs are not the same as preexisting rafts, prompting a major revision of the raft model. Nevertheless, raft-targeting signals identified by DRM analysis are often required for protein function, implicating rafts in a variety of cell processes.},

abstract = {Partial resistance of cell membranes to solubilization with mild detergents and the analysis of isolated detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) have been used operationally to define membrane domains. Given the multitude of detergents used for this purpose, we sought to investigate whether extraction with different detergents might reflect the same underlying principle of domain formation. We therefore compared the protein and lipid content of DRMs prepared with a variety of detergents from two cell lines. We found that the detergents differ considerably in their ability to selectively solubilize membrane proteins and to enrich sphingo-lipids and cholesterol over glycerophospholipids as well as saturated over unsaturated phosphatidylcholine. In addition, we observed cell type-dependent variations of the molecular characteristics of DRMs and the effectiveness of particular detergents. These results make it unlikely that different detergents reflect the same aspects of membrane organization and underscore both the structural complexity of cell membranes and the need for more sophisticated analytical tools to understand their architecture. B iological membranes are composed of a puzzling variety of lipids. Such diversity would be unnecessary if lipid bilayers served only as hydrophobic barriers and homogeneous two-dimensional solvents for membrane proteins. As is now increasingly appreciated, membranes show extensive lipid-driven com-partmentalization, giving rise to distinct membrane domains. These domains differ in their composition, physical properties, and biological functions. Membranes typically exist in a fluid state characterized by unconfined diffusion of its loosely packed lipids. This state is therefore also called the liquid-disordered (l d) phase. However, studies of liposomes (1, 2) as well as model membranes (3) have shown that certain lipids have the propensity to associate with each other, thus segregating from the l d phase. These lipids are cholesterol, sphingolipids with their usually saturated fatty acids, and saturated glycerophospholipids. The structure of their hy-drophobic moieties allows them to pack more tightly than the kinked unsaturated glycerophospholipids. As a result, they can establish a more ordered state, called the liquid-ordered (l o) phase (4). Most likely, l o phases also exist in cell membranes with a sufficient proportion of cholesterol and sphingolipids (5). The l o phase is thought to form discrete microdomains interspersed in the continuous l d phase. These microdomains have been termed ''lipid rafts'' (6) and are believed to play important roles in signal transduction and protein sorting (7-9). A common biochemical method to analyze the domain organization of membranes is extraction with mild detergents like Triton X-100 (Triton). Although detergent treatment disrupts most lipid-lipid interactions, a minor fraction of cell membranes is preserved and can be isolated as detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs). DRMs prepared with Triton probably originate from the cholesterol-and sphingolipid-rich l o phase, which resists extraction due to its tight lipid packing (5). Detergent extraction also disrupts lipid-protein interactions, so that most membrane proteins are solubilized. Only few proteins retain their association with lipids and are recovered in DRMs. Thus, DRM association of a protein is indicative of a strong interaction with highly ordered domains in the l o phase. However, DRMs may only imperfectly reflect the distribution of membrane components between the l o and l d phases (10), and it is unknown how well the composition of DRMs correlates with the components of native lipid rafts in cell membranes. DRMs have mainly been prepared with Triton (11) and 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) (12), but other detergents such as Brij 58 (13), Brij 96 (14), Lubrol WX (15), and Brij 98 (16) have also been used. Yet, it is unclear whether DRMs prepared with different detergents similarly reflect the same aspect of membrane organization , i.e., segregation of cholesterol-and sphingolipid-rich domains in the l o phase from the l d phase rich in unsaturated glycerophospholipids. To facilitate comparison of results obtained with different detergents, we analyzed the protein and lipid content of DRMs isolated with various mild detergents. We used two cell lines, epithelial Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and human T cell leukemia cells (Jurkat cells), to test whether the characteristics of DRMs and the effectiveness of particular detergents vary between cell types. In addition, we evaluated tools to manipulate DRM association of proteins. We found that DRMs obtained with different detergents differ considerably in their protein and lipid content, and that these differences are cell type-dependent. Our results caution against equating DRMs prepared with different detergents and from different cell types.},

abstract = {The main function of skin is to serve as a physical barrier between the body and the environment. This barrier capacity is in turn a function of the physical state and structural organization of the stratum corneum extracellular lipid matrix. This lipid matrix is essentially composed of very long chain saturated ceramides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids. Three unsolved key questions are i), whether the stratum corneum extracellular lipid matrix is constituted by a single gel phase or by coexisting crystalline (solid) domains; ii), whether a separate liquid crystalline phase is present; and iii), whether pH has a direct effect on the lipid matrix phase behavior. In this work the lateral structure of membranes composed of lipids extracted from human skin stratum corneum was studied in a broad temperature range (10°C-90°C) using different techniques such as differential scanning calorimetry, fluorescence spectroscopy, and two-photon excitation and laser scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy. Here we show that hydrated bilayers of human skin stratum corneum lipids express a giant sponge-like morphology with dimensions corresponding to the global three-dimensional morphology of the stratum corneum extracellular space. These structures can be directly visualized using the aforementioned fluorescence microscopy techniques. At skin physiological temperatures (28°C-32°C), the phase state of these hydrated bilayers correspond microscopically (radial resolution limit 300 nm) to a single gel phase at pH7, coexistence of different gel phases betweenpH 5 and 6, and no fluid phase at any pH. This observation suggests that the local pH in the stratum corneum may control the physical properties of the extracellular lipid matrix by regulating membrane lateral structure and stability. {\textcopyright} 2007 by the Biophysical Society.},

Unexpectedly, this number decreased with a decreasing lipid:KcsA tetramer molar ratio in the range of 88:1 to 30:1, consistent with sharing of annular lipid shells and KcsA-KcsA contact at high mole fractions of protein. Fluorescence quenching experiments with brominated phospholipids showed a decrease in fluorescence quenching at low lipid:KcsA tetramer mole ratios, also consistent with KcsA-KcsA contact at high mole fractions of protein. The effects of low mole ratios of lipid seen in EPR and fluorescence quenching experiments were more marked in bilayers of PC than in bilayers of PG, suggesting stronger association of PG than PC with KcsA. This was confirmed by direct measurement of lipid association constants using spin-labeled phospholipids, showing higher association constants for all anionic lipids than for PC.

The fluorescence emission spectrum of Dauda bound to KcsA in bilayers of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine contains three components, which can be attributed to KcsA-bound and lipid-bound Dauda together with unbound Dauda. The binding of Dauda to KcsA was characterized by a dissociation constant of 0.47 ± 0.10 $\mu$M with 0.94 ± 0.06 binding site per KcsA tetramer. Displacement of KcsA-bound Dauda by the tetrabutylammonium (TBA) ion confirmed that the Dauda binding site was in the central cavity of KcsA. Dissociation constants for a range of fatty acids were determined by displacement of Dauda: binding of fatty acids increased in strength with an increasing chain length from C14 to C20 but then decreased in strength from C20 to C22. Increasing the number of double bonds in the chain from one to four had little effect on binding, dissociation constants for oleic acid and arachidonic acid, for example, being 2.9 ± 0.2 and 3.0 ± 0.4 $\mu$M, respectively. Binding of TBA to KcsA was very slow, whereas binding of Dauda was fast, suggesting that TBA can enter the cavity only through an open channel whereas Dauda can bind to the closed channel, presumably entering the cavity via the lipid bilayer.},

abstract = {The lateral mobility of surface receptors can define the signaling properties of a synapse and rapidly change synaptic function. Here we use single-particle tracking with Quantum Dots to follow nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on the surface of chick ciliary ganglion neurons in culture. We find that both heteropentameric alpha3-containing receptors (alpha3*-nAChRs) and homopentameric alpha7-containing receptors (alpha7-nAChRs) access synaptic domains by lateral diffusion. They have comparable mobilities and display Brownian motion in extrasynaptic space but are constrained and move more slowly in synaptic space. The two receptor types differ in the nature of their synaptic restraints. Disruption of lipid rafts, PDZ-containing scaffolds, and actin filaments each increase the mobility of alpha7-nAChRs in synaptic space while collapse of microtubules has no effect. The opposite is seen for alpha3*-nAChRs where synaptic mobility is increased only by microtubule collapse and not the other manipulations. Other differences are found for regulation of alpha3*-nAChR and alpha7-nAChR mobilities in extrasynaptic space. Most striking are effects on the immobile populations of alpha7-nAChRs and alpha3*-nAChRs. Disruption of either lipid rafts or PDZ scaffolds renders half of the immobile alpha3*-nAChRs mobile without changing the proportion of immobile alpha7-nAChRs. Similar results were obtained with chick sympathetic ganglion neurons, though regulation of receptor mobility differed in at least one respect from that seen with ciliary ganglion neurons. Control of nAChR lateral mobility, therefore, is determined by mechanisms that are domain specific, receptor subtype dependent, and cell-type constrained. The outcome is a system that could tailor nicotinic signaling capabilities to specific needs of individual locations.},

Cholesterol removal by methyl-$\beta$-cyclodextrin (M$\beta$CD) induced an increase in the frequency of miniature end-plate potentials (MEPPs) and spontaneous destaining of synaptic vesicles labeled with the styryl dye FM1-43. Treatment with M$\beta$CD also increased the size of MEPPs without causing significant changes in nicotinic receptor clustering. At the ultrastructural level, synaptic vesicles from nerve terminals treated with M$\beta$CD were larger than those from control. In addition, treatment with M$\beta$CD reduced the fusion of synaptic vesicles that are mobilized during KCl-evoked stimulation, but induced recycling of those vesicles that fuse spontaneously. We therefore suggest that M$\beta$CD might favor the release of vesicles that belong to a pool that is different from that involved in the KCl-evoked release. These results reveal fundamental differences in the synaptic vesicle cycle for spontaneous and evoked release, and suggest that deregulation of cholesterol affects synaptic vesicle biogenesis and increases transmitter packing.},

Methyl-$\beta$-cyclodextrin (0.1 mM) reduced resting potential of muscle fibers and abolished local endplate membrane hyperpolarization in rat diaphragm. This effect was associated with selective reduction of electrogenic activity of $\alpha$2-isoform of Na,K-ATPase without changes in the level of intracellular acetylcholine. Experiments with cholesterol marker filipin showed that methyl-$\beta$-cyclodextrin in this dose induced cholesterol translocation from lipid rafts to liquid phase of the membrane without its release into extracellular space. This modification of lipid rafts by methyl-$\beta$-cyclodextrin presumably impaired the mechanism maintaining electrogenesis in endplates mediated by modulation of Na,K-ATPase by non-quantum acetylcholine. Cholesterol can serve as a molecular component of this mechanism.},

abstract = {The activities of integral membrane proteins are often affected by the structures of the lipid molecules that surround them in the membrane. One important parameter is the hydrophobic thickness of the lipid bilayer, defined by the lengths of the lipid fatty acyl chains. Membrane proteins are not rigid entities, and deform to ensure good hydrophobic matching to the surrounding lipid bilayer. The structure of the lipid headgroup region is likely to be important in defining the structures of those parts of a membrane protein that are located in the lipid headgroup region. A number of examples are given where the conformation of the headgroup-embedded region of a membrane protein changes during the reaction cycle of the protein; activities of such proteins might be expected to be particularly sensitive to lipid headgroup structure. Differences in hydrogen bonding potential and hydration between the headgroups of phosphatidycholines and phosphatidylethanolamines could be important factors in determining the effects of these lipids on protein activities, as well as any effects related to the tendency of the phosphatidylethanolamines to form a curved, hexagonal HIIphase. Effects of lipid structure on protein aggregation and helix-helix interactions are also discussed, as well as the effects of charged lipids on ion concentrations close to the surface of the bilayer. Interpretations of lipid effects in terms of changes in protein volume, lipid free volume, and curvature frustration are also described. Finally, the role of non-annular, or 'co-factor' lipids, tightly bound to membrane proteins, is described. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

However, this new view is still insufficient to explain the cellular control of surface lipid diversity or membrane deformability. During the past decades, the hypothesis that some lipids form large (submicrometric/mesoscale vs nanometric rafts) and stable ({\textgreater} min vs s) membrane domains has emerged, largely based on indirect methods. Morphological evidence for stable submicrometric lipid domains, well-accepted for artificial and highly specialized biological membranes, was further reported for a variety of living cells from prokaryot es to yeast and mammalian cells. However, results remained questioned based on limitations of available fluorescent tools, use of poor lipid fixatives, and imaging artifacts due to non-resolved membrane projections. In this review, we will discuss recent evidence generated using powerful and innovative approaches such as lipid-specific toxin fragments that support the existence of submicrometric domains. We will integrate documented mechanisms involved in the formation and maintenance of these domains, and provide a perspective on their relevance on membrane deformability and regulation of membrane protein distribution.},

abstract = {Cys-loop receptors are neurotransmitter-gated ion channels that are essential mediators of fast chemical neurotransmission and are associated with a large number of neurological diseases and disorders, as well as parasitic infections. Members of this ion channel superfamily mediate excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmission depending on their ligand and ion selectivity. Structural information for Cys-loop receptors comes from several sources including electron microscopic studies of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, high-resolution X-ray structures of extracellular domains and X-ray structures of bacterial orthologues. In 2011 our group published structures of the Caenorhabditis elegans glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl) in complex with the allosteric partial agonist ivermectin, which provided insights into the structure of a possibly open state of a eukaryotic Cys-loop receptor, the basis for anion selectivity and channel block, and the mechanism by which ivermectin and related molecules stabilize the open state and potentiate neurotransmitter binding. However, there remain unanswered questions about the mechanism of channel opening and closing, the location and nature of the shut ion channel gate, the transitions between the closed/resting, open/activated and closed/desensitized states, and the mechanism by which conformational changes are coupled between the extracellular, orthosteric agonist binding domain and the transmembrane, ion channel domain. Here we present two conformationally distinct structures of C. elegans GluCl in the absence of ivermectin. Structural comparisons reveal a quaternary activation mechanism arising from rigid-body movements between the extracellular and transmembrane domains and a mechanism for modulation of the receptor by phospholipids.},

Few computational approaches have been developed for making quantitative predictions of binding probabilities in environments other than dilute isotropic solution. Available techniques, ranging from simple automated docking procedures to sophisticated thermodynamics-based methods, have been developed almost exclusively for use in soluble proteins. Here we extend the asymptotically exact Alchemical Free Energy Perturbation technique to quantifying occupancies of sites on proteins in a complex bulk, including phase-separated, anisotropic, or non-dilute solutions, using a thermodynamically consistent and easily generalized approach that resolves several previous ambiguities. To incorporate the complex bulk without overcomplicating the overall thermodynamic cycle, we simplify the common approach for ligand restraints by using a single distance-from-bound-configuration (DBC) ligand restraint during AFEP decoupling from protein. DBC restraints should be generalizable to binding modes of most small molecules, even those with strong orientational dependence. We apply this approach to calculate the likelihood that cholesterol binds to widely-studied crystallographic sites on 3 GPCRs (beta2-adrenergic, 5HT-2B, and mu-opioid) at a range of concentrations. Non-ideality of cholesterol in a binary cholesterol:phosphatidylcholine (POPC) bilayer is characterized and consistently incorporated into the interpretation.},

abstract = {A new aspect of cell membrane structure is presented, based on the dynamic clustering of sphingolipids and cholesterol to form rafts that move within the fluid bilayer. It is proposed that these rafts function as platforms for the attachment of proteins when membranes are moved around inside the cell and during signal transduction. In the prevailing view of cellular membrane structure, lipids in the bilayer function mainly as a solvent for membrane proteins 1. But in the fluid bilayer, different lipid species are asymmetrically distributed over the exoplasmic and cytoplasmic leaflets of the membrane 2. The lipids are also organized in the lateral dimension and impose more short-and long-range order than was previously recognized 3. This lateral organization probably results from preferential packing of sphingolipids and cholesterol into moving platforms , or rafts, onto which specific proteins attach within the bilayer. We now propose a model for membrane structure that describes the organization of these lipid microdomains and we present evidence that proteins can selectively be included or excluded from these microdomains. We conclude that the function of these microdomains is to serve as rafts for the transport of selected membranes or as relay stations in intracellular signalling. The concept In epithelial cells, plasma membranes are polarized into apical and basolateral domains 4 , with the former being enriched in sphingolipids (glycosphingolipids and sphingomyelin) and the latter in the glycerolipid phosphatidylcholine 2,5. Mixing of sphingolipids and phosphatidyl-choline, both of which are localized to the exoplasmic leaflet, is prevented by the tight junctions between the two cell-surface domains 2,5. Studies on the delivery of newly synthesized sphingolipids in epithelial MDCK cells showed that a simple glycosphingolipid, glucosylceramide, was preferentially transported to the apical membrane 5,6. To explain delivery to the apical domain, it was proposed that glycosphingolipid clusters formed within the exoplasmic leaflet of the Golgi membrane 5 : these microdomains were considered to be sorting centres for proteins destined for delivery to the apical plasma membrane. In support of this model, glycosylphosphatidylinositol(GPI)-anchored proteins use glyco-lipid anchors as apical sorting determinants 7. Moreover, caveolae, small invaginations of the plasma membrane that are devoid of clathrin coats and are present in many cell types 8 , contain clusters of glycosphingolipids 9 and need cholesterol to function 10. As caveolae may be involved in endocytosis 9 and transcytosis 11 , a function for sphingolipid rafts in membrane trafficking was plausible 12 .},

This can be attributed to two factors: the experimental challenges that arise from the difficult chemical nature of membrane proteins, and the unclear relationship between their activity and their native environment. New approaches are therefore required to address these challenges. Recent developments in mass spectrometry have shown that it is possible to study membrane proteins in a solvent-free environment and provide detailed insights into complex interactions, ligand binding and folding processes. Interestingly, not only detergent micelles but also lipid bilayer nanodiscs or bicelles can serve as a means for the gentle desolvation of membrane proteins in the gas phase. In this manner, as well as by direct addition of lipids, it is possible to study the effects of different membrane components on the structure and function of the protein components allowing us to add functional data to the least accessible part of the proteome.},

Here, we studied the contribution of $\omega$-3 PUFAs to TRPV4 function by precisely manipulating the fatty acid content in Caenorhabditis elegans. By genetically depriving the worms of PUFAs, we determined that the metabolism of $\omega$-3 fatty acids is required for TRPV4 activity. Functional, lipid metabolome, and biophysical analyses demonstrated that $\omega$-3 PUFAs enhance TRPV4 function in human endothelial cells and support the hypothesis that lipid metabolism and membrane remodeling regulate cell reactivity. We propose a model whereby the eicosanoid's epoxide group location increases membrane fluidity and influences the endothelial cell response by increasing TRPV4 channel activity. $\omega$-3 PUFA-like molecules might be viable antihypertensive agents for targeting TRPV4 to reduce systemic blood pressure.

abstract = {Voltage-gated ion channels are crucial for both neuronal and cardiac excitability. Decades of research have begun to unravel the intriguing machinery behind voltage sensitivity. Although the details regarding the arrangement and movement in the voltage-sensing domain are still debated, consensus is slowly emerging. There are three competing conceptual models: the helical-screw, the transporter, and the paddle model. In this review we explore the structure of the activated voltage-sensing domain based on the recent X-ray structure of a chimera between Kv1.2 and Kv2.1. We also present a model for the closed state. From this we conclude that upon depolarization the voltage sensor S4 moves {\~{}}13 {\AA} outwards and rotates {\~{}}180{\textordmasculine}, thus consistent with the helical-screw model. S4 also moves relative to S3b which is not consistent with the paddle model. One interesting feature of the voltage sensor is that it partially faces the lipid bilayer and therefore can interact both with the membrane itself and with physiological and pharmacological molecules reaching the channel from the membrane. This type of channel modulation is discussed together with other mechanisms for how voltage-sensitivity is modified. Small effects on voltage-sensitivity can have profound effects on excitability. Therefore, medical drugs designed to alter the voltage dependence offer an interesting way to regulate excitability.},

We show that the polyunsaturated fatty acid linolenic acid prevents neuronal death in an animal model of transient global ischemia even when administered after the insult. Linolenic acid also protects animals treated with kainate against seizures and hippocampal lesions. The same effects have been observed in an in vitro model of seizure-like activity using glutamatergic neurons and they have been shown to be associated with blockade of glutamatergic transmission by low concentrations of distinct polyunsaturated fatty acids. Our data suggest that the opening of background K(+) channels, like TREK-1 and TRAAK, which are activated by arachidonic acid and other polyunsaturated fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic acid and linolenic acid, is a significant factor in this neuroprotective effect. These channels are abundant in the brain where they are located both pre- and post-synaptically, and are insensitive to saturated fatty acids, which offer no neuroprotection.},

abstract = {In summary, we have shown that the conventional explanation for the site of action of a ligand which alters the conductance of a membrane ion channel is that the ligand interacts or binds with the ion channel protein, changing its conductance, is inadequate to explain the primary site of action of the antiarrhythmic n-3 PUFAs. We have shown that when a neutral asparagine is replaced by a positively charged lysine in the N406 amino acid site in the $\alpha$-subunit of the human cardiac sodium channel, the n-3 fatty acids lose their inhibitory action on the sodium current. The inadequacy of this finding to explain the primary site of action of the n-3 PUFAs is demonstrated by the inhibitory effect on all other cardiac ion channels, so far tested. We show that ion channels, which share no amino acid homology with the PUFAs, have their conductance also reduced in the presence of the PUFAs, Thus a more general conceptual framework or paradigm is needed to account for the broad action of the PUFAs on diverse different ion channels lacking amino acid homology. We have been testing the membrane tension hypothesis of Andersen and associates. According to this hypothesis, the fatty acids are not acting directly on the ion channel protein but accumulating in the phospholipid membrane in immediate juxtaposition to the site in the membrane where the ion channel protein penetrates the membrane phospholipid bilayer. This alters membrane tensions exerted by the phospholipid membrane on the ion channel, which in turn causes conformational changes in the ion channel, altering the conductance of the ion channel. Our preliminary data seem to support this membrane tension hypothesis. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Free fatty acids (FFA) are essential components of the cell, where they play a key role in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, and most particularly in cell membranes, where they are central actors in shaping the physicochemical properties of the lipid bilayer and the cellular adaptation to the environment. FFA are continuously being produced and degraded, and a feedback regulatory function has been attributed to their turnover. The massive increase observed under some pathological conditions, especially in brain, has been interpreted as a protective mechanism possibly operative on ion channels, which in some cases is of stimulatory nature and in other cases inhibitory. Here we discuss the correlation between the structure of FFA and their ability to modulate protein function, evaluating the influence of saturation/unsaturation, number of double bonds, and cis vs. trans isomerism. We further focus on the mechanisms of FFA modulation operating on voltage-gated and ligand-gated ion channel function, contrasting the still conflicting evidence on direct vs. indirect mechanisms of action.},

abstract = {G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are involved in many physiological processes and are therefore key drug targets1. Although detailed structural information is available for GPCRs, the effects of lipids on the receptors, and on downstream coupling of GPCRs to G proteins are largely unknown. Here we use native mass spectrometry to identify endogenous lipids bound to three class A GPCRs. We observed preferential binding of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) over related lipids and confirm that the intracellular surface of the receptors contain hotspots for PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding. Endogenous lipids were also observed bound directly to the trimeric G$\alpha$s$\beta$$\gamma$ protein complex of the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) in the gas phase. Using engineered G$\alpha$ subunits (mini-G$\alpha$s, mini-G$\alpha$i and mini-G$\alpha$12)2, we demonstrate that the complex of mini-G$\alpha$s with the $\beta$1 adrenergic receptor ($\beta$1AR) is stabilized by the binding of two PtdIns(4,5)P2 molecules. By contrast, PtdIns(4,5)P2 does not stabilize coupling between $\beta$1AR and other G$\alpha$ subunits (mini-G$\alpha$i or mini-G$\alpha$12) or a high-affinity nanobody. Other endogenous lipids that bind to these receptors have no effect on coupling, highlighting the specificity of PtdIns(4,5)P2. Calculations of potential of mean force and increased GTP turnover by the activated neurotensin receptor when coupled to trimeric G$\alpha$i$\beta$$\gamma$ complex in the presence of PtdIns(4,5)P2 provide further evidence for a specific effect of PtdIns(4,5)P2 on coupling. We identify key residues on cognate G$\alpha$ subunits through which PtdIns(4,5)P2 forms bridging interactions with basic residues on class A GPCRs. These modulating effects of lipids on receptors suggest consequences for understanding function, G-protein selectivity and drug targeting of class A GPCRs.},

abstract = {The realization that the lipid environment is crucial for maintaining the structure and function of membrane proteins prompts new methods to understand lipid interactions. One such method, mass spectrometry, is emerging with the potential to monitor different modes of lipid binding to membrane protein complexes. Initial studies monitored the addition of lipids and deduced the kinetic and thermodynamic effects of lipid binding to proteins. Recent efforts however have focused on identifying lipids already present, explicitly in plugs, annular rings, or cavities. Lipids that bind within these orifices to membrane proteins will have higher residence times than those in the bulk lipid bilayer and consequently can be quantified and characterized by mass spectrometry. In special cases, lipids identified within cavities have been proposed as substrates following activity assays. Alternatively, a gas-phase unfolding protocol can be used to distinguish lipids that are important for stability. These lipids can subsequently be added during crystallization for the characterization of lipid-bound protein complexes. Overall therefore this Perspective provides an overview of recent advances in mass spectrometry, with a particular focus on the distinction of the various modes of lipid binding, and their implications for structure and function as well as new directions that lie ahead.},

abstract = {Proteins undergo dynamic interactions with carbohydrates, lipids and nucleotides to form catalytic cores, fine-tuned for different cellular actions. The study of dynamic interactions between proteins and their cognate ligands is therefore fundamental to the understanding of biological systems. During the last two decades MS, and its associated techniques, has become accepted as a method for the study of protein-ligand interactions, not only for covalent complexes, where the use of MS is well established, but also, and significantly for protein-ligand interactions, for noncovalent assemblies. In this review, we employ a broad definition of a ligand to encompass protein subunits, drug molecules, oligonucleotides, carbohydrates, and lipids. Under the appropriate conditions, MS can reveal the composition, heterogeneity and dynamics of these protein-ligand interactions, and in some cases their structural arrangements and binding affinities. Herein, we highlight MS approaches for studying protein-ligand complexes, including those containing integral membrane subunits, and showcase examples from recent literature. Specifically, we tabulate the myriad of methodologies, including hydrogen exchange, proteomics, hydroxyl radical footprinting, intact complexes, and crosslinking, which, when combined with MS, provide insights into conformational changes and subtle modifications in response to ligand-binding interactions.},

abstract = {Plasma membranes of cells are asymmetric in both lipid and protein composition. The mechanism by which proteins on both sides of the membrane colocalize during signaling events is unknown but may be due to the induction of inner leaflet domains by the outer leaflet. Here we show that liquid domains form in asymmetric Montal-Mueller planar bilayers in which one leaflet's composition would phase-separate in a symmetric bilayer and the other's would not. Equally important, by tuning the lipid composition of the second leaflet, we are able to suppress domains in the first leaflet. When domains are present in asymmetric membranes, each leaflet contains regions of three distinct lipid compositions, implying strong interleaflet interactions. Our results show that mechanisms of domain induction between the outer and inner leaflets of cell plasma membranes do not necessarily require the participation of membrane proteins. Based on these findings, we suggest mechanisms by which cells could actively regulate protein function by modulating local lipid composition or interleaflet interactions.},

abstract = {Micron-scale, coexisting liquid-ordered (Lo) and liquid-disordered (Ld) phases are straightforward to observe in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) composed of ternary lipid mixtures. Experimentally, uniform membranes undergo demixing when temperature is decreased: domains subsequently nucleate, diffuse, collide, and coalesce until only one domain of each phase remains. The sizes of these two domains are limited only by the size of the system. Under different conditions, vesicles exhibit smaller-scale domains of fixed sizes, leading to the question of what sets the length scale. In membranes with excess area, small domains are expected when coarsening is hindered or when a microemulsion or modulated phase arises. Here, we test predictions of how the size, morphology, and fluorescence levels of small domains vary with the membrane's temperature, tension, and composition. Using GUVs and cell-derived giant plasma membrane vesicles, we find that 1) the characteristic size of domains decreases when temperature is increased or membrane tension is decreased, 2) stripes are favored over circular domains for lipid compositions with low energy per unit interface, 3) fluorescence levels are consistent with domain registration across both monolayer leaflets of the bilayer, and 4) small domains form in GUVs composed of lipids both with and without ester-linked lipids. Our experimental results are consistent with several elements of current theories for microemulsions and modulated phases and inconsistent with others, suggesting a motivation to modify or enhance current theories.},

abstract = {Only a year after the seminal paper of Singer and Nicolson in which the fluid mosaic model for bio mem­ brane organization was proposed 1 , the first observations that cell membranes can be separated into detergent­ labile and detergent­resistant fractions 2 sparked the idea that distinct membrane sub compartments are present in biological membranes (for a brief history of biomembrane models, see REF. 3). This finding was followed by a number of observations that suggested that cellular membranes are laterally hetero geneous at the submicro metre scale 4-9. The membrane raft (or lipid raft) hypothesis emerged as a way of explaining this lateral membrane inhomogeneity: it proposed that the interactions between specific lipids (for example, cholesterol, relatively saturated lipids and glycosylated lipids) in the plane of the membrane drive the formation of functionally important, relatively ordered membrane regions that recruit other lipids and proteins 10. This concept was supported by observations of biomimetic model membranes, which provide clear evidence that certain lipids interact preferentially with one another, engage in collective behaviour and gener ate large­ scale lateral domains as a consequence of liquid-liquid phase separation 11. However, the presence and relevance of such ordered membrane domains in vivo were unclear, owing in part to the lack of direct observations of these domains and uncertain definitions of the lipid raft concept. To address this uncertainty, a consensus operational defin ition of lipid rafts was formulated in 2006, with the available evidence suggesting that rafts are heterogeneous, dynamic (in terms of both lateral mobility and association-dissociation), cholesterol­ and sphingolipid­ enriched membrane nanodomains (10-200 nm) that have the potential to form micro­ scopic domains ({\textgreater}300 nm) upon clustering induced by protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions 12 (FIG. 1). These domains are present in both the inner and the outer leaflets of an asymmetric cell membrane, are pre­ sumably coupled across leaflets 13,14 and form functional platforms for the regulation of cellular processes 15. Recently, several emerging biochemical and biophysical techniques have provided support for the presence of these domains in cells and suggested key roles for mem­ brane hetero geneity in various cellular functions. The conservation of lipid rafts throughout the tree of life has also been demonstrated (Supplementary information S1 (box)), which has provided further support for their biological significance. However, lipid rafts continue to elude direct microscopic detection; thus, the presence and exact nature of rafts in live cells remain the subject of debate, particularly as different methodologies can often yield seemingly contradictory results 16. Here, we define rafts as transient, relatively ordered membrane domains, the formation of which is driven by lipid-lipid and lipid-protein interactions, and we discuss the technological advances that have reignited excitement around this concept and its in vivo relevance. In particular, we focus on the current understanding of the mechanisms of raft formation and maintenance, and conclude with a discussion of the challenges that remain in this dynamic field. The coexistence of two phases with distinct compositions and biophysical properties. The components of both phases can diffuse and rearrange rapidly. Abstract | Cellular plasma membranes are laterally heterogeneous, featuring a variety of distinct subcompartments that differ in their biophysical properties and composition. A large number of studies have focused on understanding the basis for this heterogeneity and its physiological relevance. The membrane raft hypothesis formalized a physicochemical principle for a subtype of such lateral membrane heterogeneity, in which the preferential associations between cholesterol and saturated lipids drive the formation of relatively packed (or ordered) membrane domains that selectively recruit certain lipids and proteins. Recent studies have yielded new insights into this mechanism and its relevance in vivo, owing primarily to the development of improved biochemical and biophysical technologies. 2 0 1 7 M a c m i l l a n P u b l i s h e r s L i m i t e d , p a r t o f S p r i n g e r N a t u r e.

abstract = {Lateral assemblies of glycolipids and cholesterol, "rafts," have been implicated to play a role in cellular processes like membrane sorting, signal transduction, and cell adhesion. We studied the structure of raft domains in the plasma membrane of non-polarized cells. Overexpressed plasma membrane markers were evenly distributed in the plasma membrane. We compared the patching behavior of pairs of raft markers (defined by insolubility in Triton X-100) with pairs of raft/non-raft markers. For this purpose we cross-linked glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), Thy-1, influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), and the raft lipid ganglioside GM1 using antibodies and/or cholera toxin. The patches of these raft markers overlapped extensively in BHK cells as well as in Jurkat T-lymphoma cells. Importantly, patches of GPI-anchored PLAP accumulated src-like protein tyrosine kinase fyn, which is thought to be anchored in the cytoplasmic leaflet of raft domains. In contrast patched raft components and patches of transferrin receptor as a non-raft marker were sharply separated. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that coalescence of cross-linked raft elements is mediated by their common lipid environments, whereas separation of raft and non-raft patches is caused by the immiscibility of different lipid phases. This view is supported by the finding that cholesterol depletion abrogated segregation. Our results are consistent with the view that raft domains in the plasma membrane of non-polarized cells are normally small and highly dispersed but that raft size can be modulated by oligomerization of raft components.},

abstract = {Biological membranes form supramolecular aggregates composed of lipids and proteins to which carbohydrate may be covalently bound. To be able to study membrane structure and function it is usually necessary to dissociate the membrane into its components. The techniques for extraction and analysis of the membrane lipids are well worked out, and are mainly based on the use of organic solvents. These have also been used to extract the proteins, but the resultant irreversible aggregation and denaturation of many membrane proteins limit their usefulness. Partial and selective protein solubilization can be obtained by a number of methods involving chelating agents, manipulation of ionic strength and pH. Protein perturbants (i.e. urea, guanidine and chaotropic agents) and enzymatic digestion have also been used. However, these procedures do not lead to solubilization of the proteins which are more strongly bound to the lipid matrix of the membrane. For such proteins the use of detergents (synthetic detergents, bile salts and saponins) appears to provide the most generally useful extraction method presently available. The literature on the use of detergents in membrane solubilization is vast, and scattered. Their use has largely been empirical, and few guidelines on the mechanisms of action have been available [1-6]. To make things even more difficult for a reviewer, there is another large body of data on the properties of detergents in aqueous solutions. This field constitutes a branch of science in itself, the knowledge of which is essential for the proper use of detergents. It is not the intention of this article to review systematically the literature on detergents, and try to compile an exhaustive catalogue of facts and references. This would be quite a hopeless task. Instead, we will focus our attention on the work that deals with the mechanisms of detergent action. Useful generalisations are beginning to emerge from recent work. From a short general survey of the properties of detergents we proceed to model lipid systems and to detergent-protein interactions before turning to the possible sequence of events when detergents interact with biological membranes.},

abstract = {A new aspect of cell membrane structure is presented, based on the dynamic clustering of sphingolipids and cholesterol to form rafts that move within the fluid bilayer. It is proposed that these rafts function as platforms for the attachment of proteins when membranes are moved around inside the cell and during signal transduction. In the prevailing view of cellular membrane structure, lipids in the bilayer function mainly as a solvent for membrane proteins 1. But in the fluid bilayer, different lipid species are asymmetrically distributed over the exoplasmic and cytoplasmic leaflets of the membrane 2. The lipids are also organized in the lateral dimension and impose more short-and long-range order than was previously recognized 3. This lateral organization probably results from preferential packing of sphingolipids and cholesterol into moving platforms , or rafts, onto which specific proteins attach within the bilayer. We now propose a model for membrane structure that describes the organization of these lipid microdomains and we present evidence that proteins can selectively be included or excluded from these microdomains. We conclude that the function of these microdomains is to serve as rafts for the transport of selected membranes or as relay stations in intracellular signalling. The concept In epithelial cells, plasma membranes are polarized into apical and basolateral domains 4 , with the former being enriched in sphingolipids (glycosphingolipids and sphingomyelin) and the latter in the glycerolipid phosphatidylcholine 2,5. Mixing of sphingolipids and phosphatidyl-choline, both of which are localized to the exoplasmic leaflet, is prevented by the tight junctions between the two cell-surface domains 2,5. Studies on the delivery of newly synthesized sphingolipids in epithelial MDCK cells showed that a simple glycosphingolipid, glucosylceramide, was preferentially transported to the apical membrane 5,6. To explain delivery to the apical domain, it was proposed that glycosphingolipid clusters formed within the exoplasmic leaflet of the Golgi membrane 5 : these microdomains were considered to be sorting centres for proteins destined for delivery to the apical plasma membrane. In support of this model, glycosylphosphatidylinositol(GPI)-anchored proteins use glyco-lipid anchors as apical sorting determinants 7. Moreover, caveolae, small invaginations of the plasma membrane that are devoid of clathrin coats and are present in many cell types 8 , contain clusters of glycosphingolipids 9 and need cholesterol to function 10. As caveolae may be involved in endocytosis 9 and transcytosis 11 , a function for sphingolipid rafts in membrane trafficking was plausible 12 .},

abstract = {The spatiotemporal organisation of membranes is often characterised by the formation of large protein clusters. In Escherichia coli, outer membrane protein (OMP) clustering leads to OMP islands, the formation of which underpins OMP turnover and drives organisation across the cell envelope. Modelling how OMP islands form in order to understand their origin and outer membrane behaviour has been confounded by the inherent difficulties of simulating large numbers of OMPs over meaningful timescales. Here, we overcome these problems by training a mesoscale model incorporating thousands of OMPs on coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. We achieve simulations over timescales that allow direct comparison to experimental data of OMP behaviour. We show that specific interaction surfaces between OMPs are key to the formation of OMP clusters, that OMP clusters present a mesh of moving barriers that confine newly inserted proteins within islands, and that mesoscale simulations recapitulate the restricted diffusion characteristics of OMPs.},

abstract = {Cell membranes are crowded and complex environments. To investigate the effect of protein-lipid interactions on dynamic organization in mammalian cell membranes, we have performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations containing {\textgreater}100 copies of an inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channel which forms specific interactions with the regulatory lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). The tendency of protein molecules to cluster has the effect of organizing the membrane into dynamic compartments. At the same time, the diversity of lipids present has a marked effect on the clustering behavior of ion channels. Sub-diffusion of proteins and lipids is observed. Protein crowding alters the sub-diffusive behavior of proteins and lipids such as PIP2 which interact tightly with Kir channels. Protein crowding also affects bilayer properties, such as membrane undulations and bending rigidity, in a PIP2-dependent manner. This interplay between the diffusion and the dynamic organization of Kir channels may have important implications for channel function.},

abstract = {The interactions between membrane proteins and their lipid bilayer environment play important roles in the stability and function of such proteins. Extended (15-20 ns) molecular dynamics simulations have been used to explore the interactions of two membrane proteins with phosphatidylcholine bilayers. One protein (KcsA) is an $\alpha$-helix bundle and embedded in a palmitoyl oleoyl phosphatidylcholine bilayer; the other (OmpA) is a $\beta$-barrel outer-membrane protein and is in a dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine bilayer. The simulations enable analysis in detail of a number of aspects of lipid-protein interactions. In particular, the interactions of aromatic amphipathic side chains (i.e., Trp, Tyr) with lipid headgroups, and "snorkeling" interactions of basic side chains (i.e., Lys, Arg) with phosphate groups are explored. Analysis of the number of contacts and of H-bonds reveal fluctuations on an ∼1- to 5-ns timescale. There are two clear bands of interacting residues on the surface of KcsA, whereas there are three such bands on OmpA. A large number of Arg-phosphate interactions are seen for KcsA; for OmpA, the number of basic-phosphate interactions is smaller and shows more marked fluctuations with respect to time. Both classes of interaction occur in clearly defined interfacial regions of width ∼1 nm. Analysis of lateral diffusion of lipid molecules reveals that "boundary" lipid molecules diffuse at about half the rate of bulk lipid. Overall, these simulations present a dynamic picture of lipid-protein interactions: there are a number of more specific interactions but even these fluctuate on an ∼1- to 5-ns timescale.},

The accuracy of the coarse-grained simulations is established via comparison with the equivalent atomistic simulations of self-assembly of protein/detergent micelles. The simulation of OmpA/bilayer self-assembly reveals how a folded outer membrane protein can be inserted in a bilayer. The glycophorin/bilayer simulation supports the two-state model of membrane folding, in which transmembrane helix insertion precedes dimer self-assembly within a bilayer. The simulations also suggest that a dynamic equilibrium exists between the glycophorin helix monomer and dimer within a bilayer.

At small observation times ({\textless}10 ns) particle vibrations dominate phospholipid diffusion elevating the calculated values from the longer time-scale bulk value ({\textgreater}50 ns) of 8.5×10(-7) cm(2) s(-1). The phospholipid diffusion around each protein was found to vary based on distance from protein. An asymmetry in the diffusion of annular lipids in the inner and outer leaflets was observed and correlated with an asymmetry in charged residues in the vicinity of the inner and outer leaflet head-groups. Protein rotational and translational diffusion were also found to vary with observation time and were inversely correlated with the radius of gyration of the protein in the plane of the bilayer. As the concentration of protein within the bilayer was increased, the overall mobility of the membrane decreased reflected in reduced lipid diffusion coefficients for both lipid and protein components. The increase in protein concentration also resulted in a decrease in the anomalous diffusion exponent $\alpha$ of the lipid. Formation of extended clusters and networks of proteins led to compartmentalisation of lipids in extreme cases.},

abstract = {The association of hemagglutinin (HA) with lipid rafts in the plasma membrane is an important feature of the assembly process of influenza virus A. Lipid rafts are thought to be small, fluctuating patches of membrane enriched in saturated phospholipids, sphingolipids, cholesterol and certain types of protein. However, raft-associating transmembrane (TM) proteins generally partition into Ld domains in model membranes, which are enriched in unsaturated lipids and depleted in saturated lipids and cholesterol. The reason for this apparent disparity in behavior is unclear, but model membranes differ from the plasma membrane in a number of ways. In particular, the higher protein concentration in the plasma membrane may influence the partitioning of membrane proteins for rafts. To investigate the effect of high local protein concentration, we have conducted coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG MD) simulations of HA clusters in domain-forming bilayers. During the simulations, we observed a continuous increase in the proportion of raft-type lipids (saturated phospholipids and cholesterol) within the area of membrane spanned by the protein cluster. Lateral diffusion of unsaturated lipids was significantly attenuated within the cluster, while saturated lipids were relatively unaffected. On this basis, we suggest a possible explanation for the change in lipid distribution, namely that steric crowding by the slow-diffusing proteins increases the chemical potential for unsaturated lipids within the cluster region. We therefore suggest that a local aggregation of HA can be sufficient to drive association of the protein with raft-type lipids. This may also represent a general mechanism for the targeting of TM proteins to rafts in the plasma membrane, which is of functional importance in a wide range of cellular processes.},

abstract = {Integrins are heterodimeric ($\alpha$$\beta$) cell surface receptors that are activated to a high affinity state by the formation of a complex involving the $\alpha$/$\beta$ integrin transmembrane helix dimer, the head domain of talin (a cytoplasmic protein that links integrins to actin), and the membrane. The talin head domain contains four sub-domains (F0, F1, F2 and F3) with a long cationic loop inserted in the F1 domain. Here, we model the binding and interactions of the complete talin head domain with a phospholipid bilayer, using multiscale molecular dynamics simulations. The role of the inserted F1 loop, which is missing from the crystal structure of the talin head, PDB:3IVF, is explored. The results show that the talin head domain binds to the membrane predominantly via cationic regions on the F2 and F3 subdomains and the F1 loop. Upon binding, the intact talin head adopts a novel V-shaped conformation which optimizes its interactions with the membrane. Simulations of the complex of talin with the integrin $\alpha$/$\beta$ TM helix dimer in a membrane, show how this complex promotes a rearrangement, and eventual dissociation of, the integrin $\alpha$ and $\beta$ transmembrane helices. A model for the talin-mediated integrin activation is proposed which describes how the mutual interplay of interactions between transmembrane helices, the cytoplasmic talin protein, and the lipid bilayer promotes integrin inside-out activation.},

The simulations allow characterization of the mechanism of spontaneous exothermic insertion of CNTs into lipid bilayer membranes. The size and type of CNT determine the nature and extent of the local perturbation of the bilayer. Single-walled CNTs are shown to insert via a two-step mechanism with initial transient formation of a water filled pore followed by full insertion of the CNT into the bilayer. The latter stage is associated with formation of a persistent inverted micelle arrangement of lipid molecules trapped inside the CNT. This suggests a possible vehicle for nano-encapsulation of drugs, enabling their entry into and subsequent release within cells following endocytosis of CNT-containing membranes.},

Lipid hydrocarbon chain order parameters calculated from the L(o) phase are in excellent agreement with (2)H NMR measurements; the local hexagonal packing is also consistent with (1)H-MAS NMR spectra of the L(o) phase, NMR diffusion experiments, and small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering.

Using ideas from the physics of amorphous systems and glasses, we calculate the degree of nonaffine deformation associated with individual lipids to characterize the liquid-ordered (Lo) and liquid-disordered (Ld) regions in model lipid bilayers. We explore the usage of this method on all-atom and coarse-grained lipid bilayer trajectories. This method is helpful in defining the instantaneous Lo−Lddomain boundaries in complex multicomponent bilayer systems. The characterization is also used to highlight the effect of line-active molecules on the phase boundaries and domain mixing. Overall, we propose a framework to explore the molecular origin of spatial and dynamical heterogeneity in biomembrane systems, which can be exploited not only in computer simulations but also in experiments.},

abstract = {Cell membranes are complex multicomponent systems, which are highly heterogeneous in the lipid distribution and composition. To date, most molecular simulations have focussed on relatively simple lipid compositions, helping to inform our understanding of in vitro experimental studies. Here we describe on simulations of complex asymmetric plasma membrane model, which contains seven different lipids species including the glycolipid GM3 in the outer leaflet and the anionic lipid, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphophate (PIP2), in the inner leaflet. Plasma membrane models consisting of 1500 lipids and resembling the in vivo composition were constructed and simulations were run for 5 µs. In these simulations the most striking feature was the formation of nano-clusters of GM3 within the outer leaflet. In simulations of protein interactions within a plasma membrane model, GM3, PIP2, and cholesterol all formed favorable interactions with the model $\alpha$-helical protein. A larger scale simulation of a model plasma membrane containing 6000 lipid molecules revealed correlations between curvature of the bilayer surface and clustering of lipid molecules. In particular, the concave (when viewed from the extracellular side) regions of the bilayer surface were locally enriched in GM3. In summary, these simulations explore the nanoscale dynamics of model bilayers which mimic the in vivo lipid composition of mammalian plasma membranes, revealing emergent nanoscale membrane organization which may be coupled both to fluctuations in local membrane geometry and to interactions with proteins.},

This exchange is facilitated by the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT), the structure and function of which is critically dependent on the signature phospholipid of mitochondria, cardiolipin (CL). Here we employ multiscale molecular dynamics simulations to investigate CL interactions within a membrane environment. Using simulations at both coarse-grained (CG) and atomistic (AT) resolutions, we identify three CL binding sites on the translocase, in agreement with those seen in crystal structures and inferred from NMR measurements. Characterisation of the free energy landscape for lateral lipid interaction via potential of mean force (PMF) calculations demonstrates the strength of interaction compared to binding sites on other mitochondrial membrane proteins, as well as their selectivity for CL over other phospholipids.

These algorithms perform poorly if the step sizes are set to be too low or too high. We show in this paper that it is not difficult for an algorithm to tune these step sizes automatically to obtain a desired acceptance probability, since the logit of the acceptance probability is very nearly linear in the log of the step size, with known slope coefficient. These ideas work in most applications, including single parameter or block moves on the linear, log, or logit scales. We discuss the implementation of this algorithm in the software package YADAS.},

The adaptive sampler is based on reversible proposal distributions each of which has the mixture of multivariate t densities as its invariant density. The reversible proposals consist of a combination of independent and correlated steps that allow the sampler to traverse the parameter space efficiently as well as allowing the sampler to keep moving and locally exploring the parameter space. We employ a two-chain approach, in which a trial chain is used to adapt the proposal densities used in the main chain. Convergence of the main chain and a strong law of large numbers are proved under reasonable conditions, and without imposing a Diminishing Adaptation condition. The mixtures of multivariate t densities are fitted by an efficient Variational Approximation algorithm in which the number of components is determined automatically. The performance of the sampler is evaluated using simulated and real examples. Our autocorrelated framework is quite general and can handle mixtures other than multivariate t.},

We give a very simple estimator of this constant for proposal distributions that are univariate or multivariate normal, together with a sampling algorithm for automating the method.

abstract = {The existence of lipid rafts in biological membranes in vivo is still debated. In contrast, the formation of domains in model systems has been well documented. In giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) prepared from ternary mixtures of dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine/sphingomyelin/cholesterol, a clear separation of liquid-disordered and sphingomyelin-enriched, liquid-ordered phases could be observed. This phase separation can lead to the fission of the liquid-ordered phase from the vesicle. Here we show that in cholesterol-containing GUVs, the phase separation can involve dynamic redistribution of lipids from one phase into another as a result of a cross-linking perturbation. We found that the molecular structure of a sterol used for the preparation of GUVs determines (i) its ability to induce phase separation and (ii) the curvature (positive or negative) of the formed liquid-ordered phase. As a consequence, the latter can pinch off to the outside or inside of the vesicle. Remarkably, some mixtures of sterols induce liquid-ordered domains exhibiting both positive and negative curvature, which can lead to a new type of budding behavior in GUVs. Our findings could have implications for the role of sterols in various cell-biological processes such as budding of secretory vesicles, endocytosis, or formation of multivesicular bodies.},

abstract = {Ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs) constitute an important family of complex membrane proteins acting as receptors for neurotransmitters (Barnard, 1992; Ortells and Lunt, 1995). The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) from Torpedo is the most extensively studied member of the LGIC family and consists of a pentameric transmembrane glycoprotein composed of four different polypeptide subunits (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta) in a 2:1:1:1 stoichiometry (Galzi and Changeux, 1995; Hucho et al., 1996) that are arranged pseudosymmetrically around a central cation-selective ion channel. Conformational transitions, from the closed (nonconducting), to agonist-induced open (ion-conducting), to desensitized (nonconducting) states, are critical for functioning of the nAChR (Karlin, 2002). The ability of the nAChR to undergo these transitions is profoundly influenced by the lipid composition of the bilayer (Barrantes, 2004). Despite existing information on lipid dependence of AChR function, no satisfactory explanation has been given on the molecular events by which specific lipids exert such effects on the activity of an integral membrane protein. To date, several hypotheses have been entertained, including (1) indirect effects of lipids through the alteration of properties of the bilayer, such as fluidity (an optimal fluidity hypothesis [Fong and McNamee, 1986]) or membrane curvature and lateral pressure (Cantor, 1997; de Kruijff, 1997), or (2) direct effects through binding of lipids to defined sites on the transmembrane portion of the protein (Jones and McNamee, 1988; Blanton and Wang, 1990; Fernandez et al., 1993; Fernandez-Ballester et al., 1994), which has led to the postulation of a possible role of certain lipids as peculiar allosteric ligands of the protein. In this paper we have reconstituted purified AChRs from Torpedo into complex multicomponent lipid vesicles in which the phospholipid composition has been systematically altered. Stopped-flow rapid kinetics of cation translocation and Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy studies have been used to illustrate the lipid dependence of both AChR function and AChR secondary structure, respectively.},

Transient domains with liquid-ordered character form and disappear on the microsecond time scale. These domains are coupled across the two membrane leaflets. In the outer leaflet, distinct nanodomains consisting of gangliosides are observed. Phosphoinositides show preferential clustering in the inner leaflet.

It demands the design of a suitable proposal probability density function (pdf) from which candidate samples can be drawn. These samples are either accepted or rejected depending on a test involving the ratio of the target and proposal densities. The adaptive rejection sampling method is an efficient algorithm to sample from a log-concave target density, that attains high acceptance rates by improving the proposal density whenever a sample is rejected. In this paper we introduce a generalized adap-tive rejection sampling procedure that can be applied with a broad class of target probability distributions, possibly non-log-concave and exhibiting multiple modes. The proposed technique yields a sequence of proposal densities that converge toward the target pdf, thus achieving very high acceptance rates. We provide a simple numerical example to illustrate the basic use of the proposed technique, together with a more elaborate positioning application using real data.},

abstract = {Biological membranes are complex and highly cooperative structures. To relate biomembrane structure to their biological function it is often necessary to consider simpler systems. Lipid bilayers composed of one or two lipid species, and with embedded proteins, provide a model system for biological membranes. Here we present a mesoscopic model for lipid bilayers with embedded proteins, which we have studied with the help of the dissipative particle dynamics simulation technique. Because hydrophobic matching is believed to be one of the main physical mechanisms regulating lipid-protein interactions in membranes, we considered proteins of different hydrophobic length (as well as different sizes). We studied the cooperative behavior of the lipid-protein system at mesoscopic time- and lengthscales. In particular, we correlated in a systematic way the protein-induced bilayer perturbation, and the lipid-induced protein tilt, with the hydrophobic mismatch (positive and negative) between the protein hydrophobic length and the pure lipid bilayer hydrophobic thickness. The protein-induced bilayer perturbation was quantified in terms of a coherence length, $\xi$P, of the lipid bilayer hydrophobic thickness profile around the protein. The dependence on temperature of $\xi$P, and the protein tilt-angle, were studied above the main-transition temperature of the pure system, i.e., in the fluid phase. We found that $\xi$P depends on mismatch, i.e., the higher the mismatch is, the longer $\xi$P becomes, at least for positive values of mismatch; a dependence on the protein size appears as well. In the case of large model proteins experiencing extreme mismatch conditions, in the region next to the so-called lipid annulus, there appears an undershooting (or overshooting) region where the bilayer hydrophobic thickness is locally lower (or higher) than in the unperturbed bilayer, depending on whether the protein hydrophobic length is longer (or shorter) than the pure lipid bilayer hydrophobic thickness. Proteins may tilt when embedded in a too-thin bilayer. Our simulation data suggest that, when the embedded protein has a small size, the main mechanism to compensate for a large hydrophobic mismatch is the tilt, whereas large proteins react to negative mismatch by causing an increase of the hydrophobic thickness of the nearby bilayer. Furthermore, for the case of small, peptidelike proteins, we found the same type of functional dependence of the protein tilt-angle on mismatch, as was recently detected by fluorescence spectroscopy measurements. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Cells have thousands of different lipids. In the plasma membrane, and in membranes of the late secretory and endocytotic pathways, these lipids are not evenly distributed over the two leaflets of the lipid bilayer. The basis for this transmembrane lipid asymmetry lies in the fact that glycerolipids are primarily synthesized on the cytosolic and sphingolipids on the noncytosolic surface of cellular membranes, that cholesterol has a higher affinity for sphingolipids than for glycerolipids. In addition, P4-ATPases, "flippases," actively translocate the aminophospholipids phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine to the cytosolic surface. ABC transporters translocate lipids in the opposite direction but they generally act as exporters rather than "floppases." The steady state asymmetry of the lipids can be disrupted within seconds by the activation of phospholipases and scramblases. The asymmetric lipid distribution has multiple implications for physiological events at the membrane surface. Moreover, the active translocation also contributes to the generation of curvature in the budding of transport vesicles.},

With typical surface densities of 30,000 proteins per $\mu$m2 cellular membranes are indeed crowded places that leave only few nanometers of private space for individual proteins. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of protein crowding in membrane systems. We first give a brief overview on state-of-the-art approaches in experiment and simulation that are frequently used to study crowded membranes. After that, we review how crowding can affect diffusive transport of proteins and lipids in membrane systems. Next, we discuss lipid and protein sorting in crowded membrane systems, including effects like protein cluster formation, phase segregation, and lipid droplet formation. Subsequently, we highlight recent progress in uncovering crowding-induced conformational changes of membranes, e.g. membrane budding and vesicle formation.

abstract = {This article summarizes a variety of physical mechanisms proposed in the literature, which can generate micro- and nanodomains in multicomponent lipid bilayers and biomembranes. It mainly focusses on lipid-driven mechanisms that do not involve direct protein-protein interactions. Specifically, it considers (i) equilibrium mechanisms based on lipid-lipid phase separation such as critical cluster formation close to critical points, and multiple domain formation in curved geometries, (ii) equilibrium mechanisms that stabilize two-dimensional microemulsions, such as the effect of linactants and the effect of curvature-composition coupling in bilayers and monolayers, and (iii) non-equilibrium mechanisms induced by the interaction of a biomembrane with the cellular environment, such as membrane recycling and the pinning effects of the cytoplasm. Theoretical predictions are discussed together with simulations and experiments. The presentation is guided by the theory of phase transitions and critical phenomena, and the appendix summarizes the mathematical background in a concise way within the framework of the Ginzburg-Landau theory.

abstract = {The cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria is composed of two membranes separated by a soluble region. Here, we report microsecond time scale coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of models of the Escherichia coli cell envelope that incorporate both membranes and various native membrane proteins. Our results predict that both the inner and outer membranes curve in a manner dependent on the size of the embedded proteins. The tightly cross-linked lip-opolysaccharide molecules (LPS) of the outer membrane cause a strong coupling between the movement of proteins and lipids. While the flow of phospholipids is more random, their diffusion is nevertheless influenced by nearby proteins. Our results reveal protein-induced lipid sorting, whereby cardiolipin is significantly enriched within the vicinity of the water channel AqpZ and the multidrug efflux pump AcrBZ. In summary, our results provide unprecedented details of the intricate relationship between both membranes of E. coli and the proteins embedded within them.},

@article{Shigemitsu2018,
abstract = {I n living systems, a myriad of biomolecules such as proteins, lip-ids, DNA and RNA spontaneously form distinct supramolecular assemblies through noncovalent interactions 1. These assemblies are diverse and orthogonal, and their formation and collapse are precisely regulated, which is crucial for the multifunctionality and autonomy of living cells. Fibrous supramolecular assemblies of cells (for example, actin filaments and microtubules) respond to various chemical and physical stimuli (for example, pH, mechanical stress and biomolecules), and dynamic structural changes are closely involved in the mechanical support of live cells, their metamorphosis, and migration 2. Given such sophisticated natural systems, the controlled hybridization of multiple supramolecular assemblies bearing orthogonal functionality is expected to produce novel artificial soft materials 3-19. Self-sorting events and orthogonal assemblies of synthetic molecules are among the key factors for the construction of ordered systems made of multiple supramo-lecular structures. A pioneering work reported the demonstration of hybrid supramolecular hydrogels by orthogonally encapsulating vesicles that contained enzymes 20. A self-sorting double network (SDN) was also prepared by applying a gradual change in the pH 21. The authors subsequently developed SDN hydrogels that can be spatially resolved using ultraviolet light 22. A phototu-neable SDN hydrogel containing a photo acid generator has also been reported 23. Additionally, catalytically incompatible groups can be incorporated into self-sorting nanofibres to achieve multi-step reactions that would not be possible in solution 24. Self-sorting n-type and p-type supramolecular nanofibres can be assembled for new electrical properties 25,26. The preparation of supramolecu-lar assemblies/polymer hybrid materials has also been reported 27. However, the development of hybrid systems composed of supra-molecules responsive to multiple (and orthogonal) stimuli still remains challenging. Such adaptive supramolecular materials exhibiting multiple and unique responses to chemical/biological stimuli could open up the next generation of smart materials for a variety of applications. Their design strategy has not yet been well explored, unlike materials that rely on co-assembly. Herein, we discovered a new self-sorting gelator pair and a supramolecular hydrogel comprising a stimulus-responsive double network (Fig. 1a). Two supramolecular nanofibres that form the SDN hydrogel responded orthogonally to different stimuli (Na 2 S 2 O 4 and bacterial alkaline phosphatase (BAP)) and the SDN hydrogel showed a bidirectional change in the macroscopic rheological properties. Due to the self-sorting of the two nanofibres, each property could be imparted without interference on mixing. Unprecedented bidirectional rheological changes led to a unique application in the bidirectionally tuneable release of proteins encapsulated in the SDN hydrogel. Furthermore, the SDN hydrogels exhibited the unique adaptive feature of stimulus-order recognition, which was expressed by the macroscopic gel-sol transition. Exploration and evaluation of SDN We recently reported that two distinct supramolecular fibres-BPmoc-F 3 28 and Phos-cycC 6 29-are self-sorting (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1), which could be clearly visualised in situ using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) 30. Our previous study suggested that orthogonal interaction modes between two components may be one of the strategies for self-sorting; various factors such as formation (kinetic) processes are significant in this event 14,21. In our cases, the large difference in the interaction modes between peptide-type BPmoc-F 3 (mainly governed by $\pi$-interactions and hydrogen bonding) and lipid-type Phos-cycC 6 (through van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonding) showed a preference for self-sorting rather than co-assembly 30,31. On the basis of this assumption, we sought to explore a new self-sorting supramolecu-lar fibre pair based on the combination of peptide-type and lipid-type hydrogelators, and found that NPmoc-FF derivatives 32,33-in which the N-terminal group is replaced with a nitrobenzyl from the boronobenzyl of BPmoc-F 3-can be self-sorted with Phos-cycC 6. Novel soft materials should comprise multiple supramolecular nanostructures whose responses (for example, assembly and disassembly) to external stimuli can be controlled independently. Such multicomponent systems are present in living cells and control the formation and break-up of a variety of supramolecular assemblies made of proteins, lipids, DNA and RNA in response to external stimuli; however, artificial counterparts are challenging to make. Here, we present a hybrid hydrogel consisting of a self-sorting double network of nanofibres in which each network responds to an applied external stimulus independent of the other. The hydrogel can be made to change its mechanical properties and rates of release of encapsulated proteins by adding Na 2 S 2 O 4 or bacterial alkaline phosphatase. Notably, the properties of the gel depend on the order in which the external stimuli are applied. Multicomponent hydrogels comprising orthogonal stimulus-responsive supramolecular assemblies would be suitable for designing novel adaptive materials.},

Aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the interaction of silica nanoparticles with Chol and the conditions for the incorporation in the monolayer. In previous works on different kind of lipid monolayers, it has been shown that hydrophilic silica nanoparticles dispersed in the sub-phase may transfer into the monolayer, driven by the interaction with the lipid molecules that make them partially hydrophobic. The results here obtained indicate that also for Chol and Chol-DPPC mixtures the presence of silica nanoparticles may have important effects on the phase behaviour and structural properties of the monolayer. As confirmed by complementary structural characterisations, BAM, AFM and ellipsometry, the principal effect of the nanoparticle incorporation is the disruption of the monolayer packing, owing to the alteration of the cohesive interactions of lipid components. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

In the thermodynamic analysis of the mixed monolayers, the areas of monolayers exhibited negative deviations from the ideal values at all compositions for lower surface pressures. However, at higher surface pressures, distinctively positive deviations from ideality were observed at lower DPPC contents. Excess free energies of mixing had been calculated and the most stable state of the mixed monolayer with x DPPC =0.5 or 0.6 was found. Moreover, the relaxation kinetics of the mixed monolayers was investigated by measuring the surface area as a function of time at a constant surface pressure of 40 mN m − 1 .

abstract = {Two mono-cis-unsaturated phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipid molecules, having very different gel-liquid crystalline phase transition temperatures as a consequence of the relative positions of the double bond, exhibit PC:cholesterol phase diagrams that are very similar to each other and to that obtained previously for a fully saturated PC:cholesterol mixture (Vist, M. R., and J. H. Davis. 1990. Biochemistry 29:451–464). This leads to the conjecture that PC:cholesterol membrane phase diagrams have a universal form which is relatively independent of the precise chemical structure of the PC molecule. One feature of this phase diagram is the observation over a wide temperature range of a fluid but highly conformationally ordered phase at bilayer concentrations of more than ∼25 mol{\%} cholesterol. This `liquid ordered' phase is postulated to be the relevant physical state for many biological membranes, such as the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells, that contain substantial amounts of cholesterol or equivalent sterols. {\textcopyright} 1992, The Biophysical Society.

abstract = {A molecular interaction model is used to describe the phase diagram of two-component phospholipid bilayer membranes of saturated phospholipids, DCnPC, with different acyl-chain lengths, n = 12,14,18,20. The interaction between acyl chains of different length is formulated in terms of a hydrophobic mismatch which permits the series of binary phase diagrams to be calculated in terms of a single 'universal' interaction parameter. The properties of the model are calculated by computer-simulation techniques which not only permit determination of the specific-heat function and the phase diagram but also reveal the local structure of the mixture in the different parts of the phase diagram. The local structure is described pictorially and characterized quantitatively in terms of a correlation function. It is shown that the non-ideal mixing of lipid species due to mismatch in the hydrophobic lengths leads to a progressively increasing local ordering as the chain-length difference is increased. A pronounced local structure is found to persist deep inside the fluid phase of the mixture. The local structure is discussed in relation to the features observed in the specific-heat function, for which theoretical data, as well as experimental data obtained from differential-scanning calorimetry are presented. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

In the modification of the functional, the solvation-induced change in the distribution function of the solute structure is taken into account with respect to the intramolecular energy of the solute. It is then demonstrated over a wide range of thermodynamic conditions that the modified form of functional provides an accurate and efficient route to the solvation free energy of a flexible solute molecule even when the structural distribution function of the solute in solution overlaps barely with that of the solute at isolation.

Mixtures of DLPC:DSPCd-70 (1:1) that were air-dried at 258C show multiple phase transitions and mixed phases in the dry state. After annealing at high temperatures, however, only one transition is seen during cooling scans. When dried in the presence of trehalose, the DLPC component shows two phase transitions at {\"{y}}228C and 758C and is not fully solidified at {\"{y}}228C. The DSPCd-70 component, however, shows a single phase transition at 788C. The temperatures of these transitions are dramatically reduced after annealing at high temperatures with trehalose. The data suggest that the sugar has a fluidizing effect on the DLPC component during drying and that this effect becomes stronger for both components with heating. Examination of infrared bands arising from the lipid phosphate and sugar hydroxyl groups suggests that the strong effect of trehalose results from direct interactions between lipid headgroups and the sugar and that these interactions become stronger after heating. The findings are discussed in terms of the protective effect of trehalose on dry membranes.},

In the liquid-liquid immiscibility region, the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient is in excellent agreement with current theories of generalized diffusivities in composite two-phase media.

abstract = {In the central nervous system, deficits in cholinergic neurotransmission correlate with decreased attention and cognitive impairment, while stimulation of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors improves attention, cognitive performance and neuronal resistance to injury as well as produces robust analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. The rational basis for the therapeutic use of orthosteric agonists and positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of nicotinic receptors arises from the finding that functional nicotinic receptors are ubiquitously expressed in neuronal and non-neuronal tissues including brain regions highly vulnerable to traumatic and ischemic types of injury (e.g., cortex and hippocampus). Moreover, functional nicotinic receptors do not vanish in age-, disease- and trauma-related neuropathologies, but their expression and/or activation levels decline in a subunit- and brain region-specific manner. Therefore, augmenting the endogenous cholinergic tone by nicotinic agents is possible and may offset neurological impairments associated with cholinergic hypofunction. Importantly, because neuronal damage elevates extracellular levels of choline (a selective agonist of $\alpha$7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors) near the site of injury, $\alpha$7-PAM-based treatments may augment pathology-activated $\alpha$7-dependent auto-therapies where and when they are most needed (i.e., in the penumbra, post-injury). Thus, nicotinic-PAM-based treatments are expected to augment the endogenous cholinergic tone in a spatially and temporally restricted manner creating the potential for differential efficacy and improved safety as compared to exogenous orthosteric nicotinic agonists that activate nicotinic receptors indiscriminately. In this review, I will summarize the existing trends in therapeutic applications of nicotinic PAMs. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In spite of its recent achievements, the technique of single particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) has not been widely used to study proteins smaller than 100 kDa, although it is a highly desirable application of this technique. One fundamental limitation is that images of small proteins embedded in vitreous ice do not contain adequate features for accurate image alignment. We describe a general strategy to overcome this limitation by selecting a fragment antigen binding (Fab) to form a stable and rigid complex with a target protein, thus providing a defined feature for accurate image alignment. Using this approach, we determined a three-dimensional structure of an ∼65 kDa protein by single particle cryoEM. Because Fabs can be readily generated against a wide range of proteins by phage display, this approach is generally applicable to study many small proteins by single particle cryoEM. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

This model could mimic control of protein transport in the membrane by the cytoskeleton. The dynamic corral acts as a gate which when open permits an otherwise trapped protein to escape to a neighboring corral in the cytoskeletal network. We solve for the escape rate over a wide range of parameters of the model, and compare these results with Monte Carlo simulations. Upon introducing measured values of the model parameters for Band 3 in erythrocyte membranes, we are able to estimate the value for one unknown parameter, the average rate at which the corral closes. The ratio of calculated closing rate to measured opening rate is roughly 100:1, consistent with a gating mechanism whereby protein mobility is regulated by dissociation and reassociation of segments of the cytoskeletal network.},

We specifically investigate the mobility of band 3 dimer on the surface of red blood cells where the spectrin cytoskeletal meshwork defines a series of "corrals" on the cell surface known to hinder protein motion. Previous models of this system have postulated that the cytoskeleton must deform to allow passage of membrane bound proteins out of these corral regions and have ignored fluctuations of the bilayer.

The addition of these effects alters the scaling of fluctuation amplitudes with system size.

Additionally, the membrane influences the function of membrane proteins. Here we review contributions to this field from continuum elastic membrane models focusing on the class of models that couple the protein to the membrane. While it has been argued that continuum models cannot reproduce the distortions observed in fully-atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we suggest that this failure can be overcome by using chemically accurate representations of the protein. We outline our recent advances along these lines with our hybrid continuum-atomistic model, and we show the model is in excellent agreement with fully-atomistic simulations of the nhTMEM16 lipid scramblase. We believe that the speed and accuracy of continuum-atomistic methodologies will make it possible to simulate large scale, slow biological processes, such as membrane morphological changes, that are currently beyond the scope of other computational approaches.

Our theory is based on the description of the height–height undulation spectrum in the presence of a curvature field. We formulated an objective function to compare the acquired undulation spectrum from the simulations to that of the theory. We recover the curvature field parameters by minimizing the objective function even in the limit where the protein-induced membrane curvature is of the same order as the amplitude due to thermal undulations. The coupling between curvature and undulations leads to significant predictions: (i) Under dilute conditions, the proteins can sense a site of spontaneous curvature at distances much larger than their size; (ii) as the density of proteins increases the coupling focuses and stabilizes the curvature field to the site of the proteins; and (iii) the mapping of the protein localization and the induction of a stable curvature is a cooperative process that can be described through a Hill function.},

abstract = {This contribution describes measurements of lipid bilayer domain line tension based on two-dimensional thermal undulations of membranes with liquid ordered/liquid disordered phase coexistence and near-critical composition at room temperature. Lateral inhomogeneity of lipid and protein composition is currently a subject of avid research aimed at determining both fundamental properties and biological relevance of membrane domains. Line tension at fluid lipid bilayer membrane domain boundaries controls the kinetics of domain growth and therefore regulates the size of compositional heterogeneities. High line tension promotes membrane domain budding and fission. Line tension could therefore be an important control parameter regulating functional aspects of biological membranes. Here the established method of fluid domain flicker spectroscopy is applied to examine thermal domain wall fluctuations of phase-separated bilayer membranes. We find a Gaussian probability distribution for the first few excited mode amplitudes, which permits an analysis by means of appropriately specialized capillary wave theory. Time autocorrelation functions are found to decay exponentially, and relaxation times are fitted by means of a hydrodynamic theory relating line tensions and excited mode relaxation kinetics. Line tensions below 1 pN are obtained, with these two approaches yielding similar results. We examine experimental artifacts that perturb the Fourier spectrum of domain traces and discuss ways to identify the number of modes that yield reliable line tension information. {\textcopyright} 2007 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Membrane remodelling plays an important role in cellular tasks such as endocytosis, vesiculation and protein sorting, and in the biogenesis of organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi apparatus. It is well established that the remodelling process is aided by specialized proteins that can sense as well as create membrane curvature, and trigger tubulation when added to synthetic liposomes. Because the energy needed for such large-scale changes in membrane geometry significantly exceeds the binding energy between individual proteins and between protein and membrane, cooperative action is essential. It has recently been suggested that curvature-mediated attractive interactions could aid cooperation and complement the effects of specific binding events on membrane remodelling. But it is difficult to experimentally isolate curvature-mediated interactions from direct attractions between proteins. Moreover, approximate theories predict repulsion between isotropically curving proteins. Here we use coarse-grained membrane simulations to show that curvature-inducing model proteins adsorbed on lipid bilayer membranes can experience attractive interactions that arise purely as a result of membrane curvature. We find that once a minimal local bending is realized, the effect robustly drives protein cluster formation and subsequent transformation into vesicles with radii that correlate with the local curvature imprint. Owing to its universal nature, curvature-mediated attraction can operate even between proteins lacking any specific interactions, such as newly synthesized and still immature membrane proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum.},

abstract = {Bimolecular reactions in the plasma membrane, such as receptor dimerization, are a key signaling step for many signaling systems. For receptors to dimerize, they must first diffuse until a collision happens, upon which a dimerization reaction may occur. Therefore, study of the dynamics of cell signaling on the membrane may require the use of a spatial modeling framework. Despite the availability of spatial simulation methods, e.g., stochastic spatial Monte Carlo (MC) simulation and partial differential equation (PDE) based approaches, many biological models invoke well-mixed assumptions without completely evaluating the importance of spatial organization. Whether one is to utilize a spatial or non-spatial simulation framework is therefore an important decision. In order to evaluate the importance of spatial effects a priori, i.e., without performing simulations, we have assessed the applicability of a dimensionless number, known as second Damk{\"{o}}hler number (Da), defined here as the ratio of time scales of collision and reaction, for 2-dimensional bimolecular reactions. Our study shows that dimerization reactions in the plasma membrane with Da ∼{\textgreater} 0.1 (tested in the receptor density range of 102-105/$\mu$m2) require spatial modeling. We also evaluated the effective reaction rate constants of MC and simple deterministic PDEs. Our simulations show that the effective reaction rate constant decreases with time due to time dependent changes in the spatial distribution of receptors. As a result, the effective reaction rate constant of simple PDEs can differ from that of MC by up to two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we show that the fluctuations in the number of copies of signaling proteins (noise) may also depend on the diffusion properties of the system. Finally, we used the spatial MC model to explore the effect of plasma membrane heterogeneities, such as receptor localization and reduced diffusivity, on the dimerization rate. Interestingly, our simulations show that localization of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) can cause the diffusion limited dimerization rate to be up to two orders of magnitude higher at higher average receptor densities reported for cancer cells, as compared to a normal cell. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The strength of the hydrophobic force and the hydrophobic thickness of the proteins are systematically varied. The results are compared with analytical predictions of two popular analytical theories: The Landau-de Gennes theory and the elastic theory. The elastic theory provides an excellent description of the fluctuation spectra of pure membranes and successfully reproduces the deformation profiles of membranes around single proteins. However, its prediction for the potential of mean force between proteins is not compatible with the simulation data for large distances. The simulations show that the lipid-mediated interactions are governed by five competing factors: direct interactions; lipid-induced depletion interactions; lipid bridging; lipid packing; and a smooth long-range contribution.

abstract = {Biological membranes contain a broad variety of lipid species whose individual physicochemical properties and collective interactions ultimately determine membrane organization. A key aspect of the organization of cellular membranes is their lateral subdivision into domains of distinct structure and composition. The most widely studied membrane domains are lipid rafts, which are the biological manifestations of liquid-ordered phases that form in sterol-containing membranes. Detailed studies of biomimetic membrane mixtures have yielded wide-ranging insights into the physical principles behind lipid rafts; however, these simplified models do not fully capture the diversity and complexity of the mammalian lipidome, most notably in their exclusion of polyunsaturated lipids. Here, we assess the role of lipid acyl chain unsaturation as a driving force for phase separation using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations validated by model membrane experiments. The clear trends in our observations and good qualitative agreements between simulations and experiments support the conclusions that highly unsaturated lipids promote liquid-liquid phase separation by enhancing the differences in lipid chain order, lipid height and cholesterol preference between the coexisting domains. Further, we show that differences in acyl chain order and cholesterol preference between high-melting and low-melting lipids are tightly correlated to domain formation in sterol-containing membranes. These observations reveal the important role of non-canonical biological lipids in the physical properties of membranes, showing that lipid polyunsaturation is a driving force for liquid-liquid phase separation.},

abstract = {Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) with 22-carbons and 6 double bonds is the extreme example of an $\omega$-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). DHA has strong medical implications since its dietary presence has been positively linked to the prevention of numerous human afflictions including cancer and heart disease. The PUFA, moreover, is essential to neurological function. It is remarkable that one simple molecule has been reported to affect so many seemingly unrelated biological processes. Although details of a molecular mode of action remain elusive, DHA must be acting at a fundamental level common to many tissues that is related to the high degree of conformational flexibility that the multiple double bonds have been identified to confer. One likely target for DHA action is at the cell membrane where the fatty acid is known to readily incorporate into membrane phospholipids. Once esterified into phospholipids DHA has been demonstrated to significantly alter many basic properties of membranes including acyl chain order and "fluidity", phase behavior, elastic compressibility, permeability, fusion, flip-flop and protein activity. It is concluded that DHA's interaction with other membrane lipids, particularly cholesterol, may play a prominent role in modulating the local structure and function of cell membranes. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {What distinguishes polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) from less unsaturated fatty acids is the presence of a repeating {\{}double bond, long{\}}CH-CH2-CH{\{}double bond, long{\}} unit that produces an extremely flexible structure rapidly isomerizing through conformational states. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) with 6 double bonds is the most extreme example. The focus of this review is the profound impact that the high disorder of DHA has on its interaction with cholesterol when the PUFA is incorporated into membrane phospholipids. Results from a battery of biophysical techniques are described. They demonstrate an aversion of DHA for the sterol that drives the lateral segregation of DHA-containing phospholipids into liquid disordered (ld) domains that are depleted in cholesterol. These domains are compositionally and organizationally the antithesis of lipid rafts, the much-studied liquid ordered (lo) domain that is enriched in predominantly saturated sphingolipids and cholesterol. We hypothesize that the introduction of DHA-rich domains into the plasma membrane where they coexist with lipid rafts is the origin, in part, of the astonishing diversity of health benefits that accrue from dietary consumption of DHA. According to our model, changes in the conformation of signaling proteins when they move between these disparate domains have the potential to modulate cell function. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Cellular membranes are laterally organized into domains of distinct structures and compositions by the differential interaction affinities between various membrane lipids and proteins. A prominent example of such structures are lipid rafts, which are ordered, tightly packed domains that have been widely implicated in cellular processes. The functionality of raft domains is driven by their selective recruitment of specific membrane proteins to regulate their interactions and functions; however, there have been few general insights into the factors that determine the partitioning of membrane proteins between coexisting liquid domains. In this work, we used extensive coarse-grained and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, potential of mean force calculations, and conceptual models to describe the partitioning dynamics and energetics of a model transmembrane domain from the linker of activation of T cells. We find that partitioning between domains is determined by an interplay between protein-lipid interactions and differential lipid packing between raft and nonraft domains. Specifically, we show that partitioning into ordered domains is promoted by preferential interactions between peptides and ordered lipids, mediated in large part by modification of the peptides by saturated fatty acids (i.e., palmitoylation). Ordered phase affinity is also promoted by elastic effects, specifically hydrophobic matching between the membrane and the peptide. Conversely, ordered domain partitioning is disfavored by the tight molecular packing of the lipids therein. The balance of these dominant drivers determines partitioning. In the case of the wild-type linker of activation of T cells transmembrane domain, these factors combine to yield enrichment of the peptide at Lo/Ldinterfaces. These results define some of the general principles governing protein partitioning between coexisting membrane domains and potentially explain previous disparities among experiments and simulations across model systems.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Binding of specific lipids to large, polytopic membrane proteins is well described, and it is clear that such lipids are crucial for protein stability and activity. In contrast, binding of defined lipid species to individual transmem-brane helices and regulation of transmembrane helix monomer–oligomer equilibria by binding of distinct lipids is a concept, which has emerged only lately. Lipids bind to single-span membrane proteins, both in the juxta-membrane region as well as in the hydrophobic membrane core. While some interactions counteract transmem-brane helix oligomerization, in other cases lipid binding appears to enhance oligomerization. As reversible oligomerization is involved in activation of many membrane proteins, binding of defined lipids to single-span transmembrane proteins might be a mechanism to regulate and/or fine-tune the protein activity. But how could lipid binding trigger the activity of a protein? How can binding of a single lipid molecule to a transmem-brane helix affect the structure of a transmembrane helix oligomer, and consequently its signaling state? These questions are discussed in the present article based on recent results obtained with simple, single-span trans-membrane proteins.

Mixtures containing 2.0 X 10 "hi/ rare earth metal and 2.0 X 10{\_}4.1/ PAR at' pH 6.2 retained color intensity even after 12 hours of standing at room temperature, a stability quite adequate for analytical applications. Rate of Color Formation. Color formation is almost instantaneous but the mixtures should stand for half an hour for the equilibration. Effect of Reagent Concentrations. The absorbance values of different mixtures of rare earth solutions (1.0 X 10{\_}4.lf) with varying ratio of PAR at pH 6.2 and at 515 mg show that maximum color formation is only attained when the mixture contains greater than 4-fold excess of the reagent with respect to the metal solution. Sensitivity. The sensitivities of the color reactions as defined by Sandell (based on an absorbance of 0.010 unit) for the rare earth metals were determined and are given in Table I. Molar Absorption Coefficients. The molar absorption coefficient of the solution of rare earth complexes was determined at 515 mg. The solutions were prepared by taking a constant amount of the rare earth (2 X 10{\_}5fli) and different amounts of excess of PAR (15 ml., 13 ml., and 10 ml. of 2.0 X 10{\~{}}4Ji reagent) were added. The average molar absorptivity calcu-lated for each rare earth metal is shown in Table I. Interferences. The effects of the metal ions associated with the rare earth metals were studied. Zn(II), Co(II), (), Cd(II), Cu(II), Tl(III), Ga(III), Zr(IV), Th(IV), U(VR, Fe (III), and Al(III) interfere at all con-centrations, while Be(II), Mo(VI), Ca (II), and Mg(II) do not interfere. Common anions like nitrate, sulfate, and chloride show no interference. A mathematical method is presented which permits the calculation of the partial specific volumes of the con-stituents of ternary and multicomponent systems from density measurements. The specific volumes of the total mix-tures and the partial specific volumes of the constituents are calculated as functions of the compositions of the mixtures for the systems polystyrene-benzene-n-hexane and styrene/acryl-onitrile copolymer-styrene-acryloni-trile. In theoretical treatments of poly-mer solutions, the composition of the system is usually expressed in volume fractions. The volume fraction, y,{\textperiodcentered}, of a constituent i is defined as ruVi WiV, v Xw{\'{i}}V i (la) where V, is the partial volume. The partial volume, Vi, of a con-stituent i in a multicomponent system is defined as (*) $\backslash$dni/nj.P.T (lb) where v is the total volume of the mix-ture, n, is the quantity of constituent i, and n, represents the quantities of all other constituents. P is the pressure and T is the absolute temperature. When n is given in moles, Vi is the partial molar volume, and when n is given in grams, U, is the partial specific volume. In the most general case, the partial volumes are not constants, but they are functions of the composition of the entire mixture. The determination of partial volumes of binary systems, especially by graph-ical methods, is described in most text-books of thermodynamics. A search of Chemical Abstracts indicates that measurements of partial volumes in ternary and multicomponent systems have not been reported as yet. Darken (2) presents a treatment which would allow the calculation of partial free energies of ternary and multicomponent systems, if it were not too complicated to be carried through to practical ap-plication. Kort{\"{u}}m and Buchholz-Meisenheimer (4) derive an equation for the calculation of partial molar quantities of multicomponent systems. Drucker (3) measured partial specific volumes of inorganic salts in aqueous solutions of a second inorganic salt. He expressed the partial specific vol-umes of only one salt in each solution as functions of their concentrations by means of empirical equations. Since he kept all other components constant, he experimented with quasi-binary systems although other components were present. In this paper, a method is presented which permits the calculation of the partial specific volumes of the three constituents of a ternary system by differentiation of an empirical equation which describes the total specific volume of a ternary mixture as a function of composition. This treatment can be extended to systems with more than three constituents.

The effects of cholesterol on the structure and mesoscopic dynamics of the bilayer were monitored as a function of cholesterol concentration. The main effects observed are a significant ordering of the DPPC chains (as monitored by NMR type order parameters), a reduced fraction of gauche bonds, a reduced surface area per lipid, less undulations—corresponding to an increased bending modulus for the membrane, smaller area fluctuations, and a reduced lateral diffusion of DPPC-lipids as well as cholesterols.},

The apoA-I-structure was examined in the rHDL particles by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopic methods, and the binding of monoclonal antibodies specific for apoA-I epitopes. The stability of apoA-I on the rHDL particles was assessed by the effects of guanidine hydrochloride on the wavelength of maximum intrinsic fluorescence of the apolipoprotein. Lipid dynamics in the acyl chain region and the polarity of the lipid-water interface were investigated by means of fluorescence probes. The conformation of apoA-I in the spherical 93-A rHDL particles was found to be very similar to that in the 96-A rHDL discs but distinct from the apoA-I structure in the 78-A rHDL discs. The stability of apoA-I to denaturation by guanidine hydrochloride was highest in the 93-A rHDL spheres. The experiments on the lipids indicate somewhat more ordered and motionally restricted acyl chains in the spheres, relative to the discs, but a similar surface polarity. These results suggest that the folding and organization of apoA-I on the three particles include protein domains consisting of interacting alpha-helical segments in the carboxyl-terminal region and a globular domain in the amino-terminal region of each apoA-I molecule. The reactivity with lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase was highest for the 96-A rHDL disc, and 16- and 34-fold lower for the 78-A rHDL disc and the 93-A rHDL sphere, respectively, possibly as a result of differences in apoA-I structure and product inhibition in these particles.},

abstract = {We studied the spreading of phospholipid bilayer membranes and the conditions for the formation of continuous bilayers on rough (glass, glass-MgFz, glass-MgFz-SiOz) and smooth (mica) solids using reflection interference contrast microscopy as an analytical tool. We show that two fundamentally different spreading mechanisms are possible: (i) The sliding of a single bilayer on a thin lubricating water film and (ii) the rolling of thin lobes of two juxtaposed bilayers in a tank tread type motion. In the first mechanism the spreadingvelocity of a straight interface exhibits a square root behavior, u -t-", allowing an estimate of the frictional coupling of the membrane to the substrate. On smooth surfaces (e.g., freshly cleaved mica) the dissipation is dominated by shear flow in the ultrathin water film separating the bilayer from the substrate. On rough surfaces in contrast (e.g., glass) friction is caused by two-dimensional flow of pinning centers through the spreading membrane. In the latter case the advancing front exhibits a self-similar interface roughness which grows with time. The growth of the roughness is analyzed, and a static roughness exponent 5 = 0.61 f 0.04 is found. The rolling ofmembranes occurs on dehydrated solid-bilayer interfaces with the substrate adjacent bilayer being immobilized. In this case a viscous fingering type spreading pattern is observed. From a practical point of view the rolling motion results in separated lipid patches with intermediate uncovered spots, while spreading by membrane sliding leads to continuous substrate-supported bilayers.},

abstract = {Well-ordered multilamellar arrays of liquid-crystalline phosphatidylcholine and equimolar phosphatidylcholine-cholesterol bilayers have been formed in the nonaqueous solvents formamide and 1,3-propanediol. The organization of these bilayers and the interactions between apposing bilayer surfaces have been investigated by X-ray diffraction analysis of liposomes compressed by applied osmotic pressures up to 6 × 107 dyn/cm2 (60 atm). The structure of egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC) bilayers in these solvents is quite different than in water, with the bilayer thickness being largest in water, 3 {\AA} narrower in formamide, and 6 {\AA} narrower in 1,3-propanediol. The incorporation of equimolar cholesterol increases the thickness of EPC bilayers immersed in each solvent, by over 10 {\AA} in the case of 1,3-propanediol. The osmotic pressures of various concentrations of the neutral polymer poly(vinylpyrrolidone) dissolved in formamide or 1,3-propanediol have been measured with a custom-built membrane osmometer. These measurements are used to obtain the distance dependence of the repulsive solvation pressure between apposing bilayer surfaces. For each solvent, the solvation pressure decreases exponentially with distance between bilayer surfaces. However, for both EPC and EPC-cholesterol bilayers, the decay length and magnitude of this repulsive pressure strongly depend on the solvent. The decay length for EPC bilayers in water, formamide, and 1,3-propanediol is found to be 1.7, 2.4, and 2.6 {\AA}, respectively, whereas the decay length for equimolar EPC-cholesterol bilayers in water, formamide, and 1,3-propanediol is found to be 2.1, 2.9, and 3.1 {\AA}, respectively. These data indicate that the decay length is inversely proportional to the cube root of the number of solvent molecules per unit volume. Thus, the decay length of the solvation pressure depends on the packing of the solvent molecules in the interbilayer space but is not strongly dependent on either the solvent's dielectric constant or the dipole moment. The magnitude of the solvation pressure, which is largest in water and smallest in 1,3-propanediol, varies with the square of the dipole potential as measured in monolayers in equilibrium with bilayers. {\textcopyright} 1989, American Chemical Society.

Recent theoretical models discuss the structural relationship between the AChR and the lipid bilayer. Independent experimental data on the composition, metabolism, and dynamics of the AChR lipid environment are analyzed in the first part of the review. The composition of the lipids in which the transmembrane AChR chains are inserted bears considerable resemblance among species, perhaps providing this evolutionarily conserved protein with an adequate milieu for its optimal functioning. The effects of lipids on the latter are discussed in the second part of the review. The third part focuses on the information gained on the dynamics of AChR and lipids in the membrane, a section that also covers the physical properties and interactions between the protein, its immediate annulus, and the bulk lipid bilayer.},

Membranes comprising multiple components pose a particular challenge, because the relative abundances need to be controlled and the equilibration of the system may take several microseconds. Here we present a comprehensive method for building membrane containing systems, characterized by simplicity and versatility. The program uses preset, coarse-grain lipid templates to build the membrane, and also allows on-the-fly generation of simple lipid types by specifying the headgroup, linker, and lipid tails on the command line. The resulting models can be equilibrated, after which a relaxed atomistic model can be obtained by reverse transformation. For multicomponent membranes, this provides an efficient means for generating equilibrated atomistic models. The method is called insane, an acronym for INSert membrANE.

An advantage of these procedures is that the basic complex Fourier transform algorithm is systematic and can relatively easily be implemented in efficient subroutines, micro-programs and special hardware devices. Once this is done, programming for special properties of the data can efficiently be left to the user to implement on a general purpose computer. The problem of establishing the correspondence between the discrete transforms and the continuous functions with which one is usually dealing is described. The application of these results and the above-mentioned subroutines to the calculation and inversion of Laplace transforms is given with formulas and empirical results displaying the effect of optimal parameters on computational efficiency and accuracy. {\textcopyright} 1970.},

Lipid extracts analyzed for phospholipid composition revealed two major phospholipid components: phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolmine. Minor phospholipid components identified were phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, and diphosphatidylglycerol. Lipid degradation by endogenous phospholipase D during membrane isolation at pH 6.5 and in the absence of chelating agents and NaF resulted in the recovery of large amounts of phosphatidic acid. Phosphatidylcholine was the principal substrate for phospholipase D.Fatty acid composition was determined for plasma membrane phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine from meristematic and mature root tissue. The fatty acids identified were 16:0, 18:0, 18:1, 18:2, and 18:3. Fatty acid composition varied with both phospholipid class and the developmental stage of the root. Results suggest that differences in the composition of the major phospholipids of plasma membrane from meristemaic and mature root sections occur in the fatty acids and not in the polar head groups. These differences and those found in the composition of the polar head groups of the minor phospholipid components, e.g. phosphatidylglycerol, may be significant for structure-function relationships within the membrane.},

abstract = {Differential geometry is the branch of mathematics that studies geometrical objects in an analytical way, using differential and integral calculus. Its tech-niques and results are applicable to many problems in biophysics, and it is particularly suited to describe the behavior of polymers and membranes in three-dimensional space. In the language of differential geometry, we will consider these as one-and two-dimensional manifolds embedded in two-or three-dimensional flat Euclidean space. A manifold is a mathematical object that has the property that around any of its points it is locally flat, although it may be curved and close upon itself on large scales. Locally, an n-dimensional manifold therefore looks like R n , and we can parametrize it in a local coordi-nate system {\{}x i {\}} i=1,...,n . If there is another point nearby, with another coordi-nate system {\{}y i {\}} i=1,...,n , then there is a continuous bijection between the two in the region where they overlap. On a smooth manifold all such bijections are smooth maps (i.e., if both the map itself and its inverse are infinitely differen-tiable). In this chapter we will introduce the differential geometry of curves and surfaces. Both biopolymers and biomembranes have a sufficiently large as-pect ratio that they can effectively be described as one-and two-dimensional objects respectively. Unlike for example a soap film, another example of an effectively two-dimensional object, the molecular structure of the polymers and lipid bilayers does have an effect on the total energy of the manifolds. In particular there will be effects on the bending of the manifolds, which are re-flected in the curvature energy. It is not known whether biological membranes are smooth or not, or in other words whether nature 'allows kinks' or not. How-ever, there are clearly possibilities to induce kinks, for example by the inclusion of wedge-shaped proteins. Boundaries within the membrane where the phys-ical parameters change are another example. We will consider the membrane to be a smooth manifold within any region for which the physical parameters are the same, and pay particular attention to such boundaries and inclusions. Although manifolds are mathematical objects by themselves that can ex-ist and be described without the need of any embedding space, in our three-dimensional reality the embedding space does play a role. Some properties of the manifold are intrinsic and therefore the same whichever embedding space we choose, but unfortunately the curvature does not satisfy that condition. We need to make explicit reference to the space in which we see the manifold, and therefore we distinguish between curves in R 2 and curves in R 3 . In the case of the membrane there are two different curvatures, one of which is intrinsic, but the other one is not. As we will see in section 2.3.5, for creatures like cells living in the embedding space, the most important curvature in terms of energy con-tributions will be the extrinsic one, defined only in the larger Euclidean space that is its home. There is a vast literature on differential geometry, both in the context of 2.2 Differential geometry of curves 13 pure mathematics and in the connection with physics. For a thorough in-troduction into manifolds, including proofs of the theorems in sections 2.3.3 and 2.3.4, see e.g. Millman and Parker [33], Spivak [34] or Do Carmo [35].

abstract = {The coarse-grained Martini model is employed extensively to study membrane protein oligomerization. While this approach is exceptionally promising given its computational effi- ciency, it is alarming that a significant fraction of these studies demonstrate unrealistic pro- tein clusters, whose formation is essentially an irreversible process. This suggests that the protein–protein interactions are exaggerated in the Martini model. If this held true, then it would limit the applicability of Martini to study multi-protein complexes, as the rapidly cluster- ing proteins would not be able to properly sample the correct dimerization conformations. In this work we first demonstrate the excessive protein aggregation by comparing the dimeriza- tion free energies of helical transmembrane peptides obtained with the Martini model to those determined from FRET experiments. Second, we show that the predictions provided by the Martini model for the structures of transmembrane domain dimers are in poor agree- ment with the corresponding structures resolved using NMR. Next, we demonstrate that the first issue can be overcome by slightly scaling down the Martini protein–protein interactions in a manner, which does not interfere with the other Martini interaction parameters. By pre- venting excessive, irreversible, and non-selective aggregation of membrane proteins, this approach renders the consideration of lateral dynamics and protein–lipid interactions in crowded membranes by the Martini model more realistic. However, this adjusted model does not lead to an improvement in the predicted dimer structures. This implicates that the poor agreement between the Martini model andNMRstructures cannot be cured by simply uniformly reducing the interactions between all protein beads. Instead, a careful amino-acid specific adjustment of the protein–protein interactions is likely required.},

abstract = {Specialized proteins serve as scaffolds sculpting strongly curved membranes of intracellu-lar organelles. Effective membrane shaping requires segregation of these proteins into do-mains and is, therefore, critically dependent on the protein-protein interaction. Interactions mediated by membrane elastic deformations have been extensively analyzed within ap-proximations of large inter-protein distances, small extents of the protein-mediated mem-brane bending and small deviations of the protein shapes from isotropic spherical segments. At the same time, important classes of the realistic membrane-shaping proteins have strongly elongated shapes with large and highly anisotropic curvature. Here we inves-tigated, computationally, the membrane mediated interaction between proteins or protein oligomers representing membrane scaffolds with strongly anisotropic curvature, and ad-dressed, quantitatively, a specific case of the scaffold geometrical parameters characteriz-ing BAR domains, which are crucial for membrane shaping in endocytosis. In addition to the previously analyzed contributions to the interaction, we considered a repulsive force stem-ming from the entropy of the scaffold orientation. We computed this interaction to be of the same order of magnitude as the well-known attractive force related to the entropy of mem-brane undulations. We demonstrated the scaffold shape anisotropy to cause a mutual align-ing of the scaffolds and to generate a strong attractive interaction bringing the scaffolds close to each other to equilibrium distances much smaller than the scaffold size. We com-puted the energy of interaction between scaffolds of a realistic geometry to constitute tens of k B T, which guarantees a robust segregation of the scaffolds into domains. Author Summary A striking feature of most of the crucial intra-cellular organelles, such as Endoplasmic Re-ticulum (ER), Golgi Complex and mitochondria is a peculiar and strongly curved shape of their membranes. Membranes resist elastically to bending and remodeling. Hence, special proteins must generate forces needed to create and maintain the intracellular membrane curvature and architecture. An effective mechanism by which proteins bend membranes is the scaffolding mechanism based on attachment to the outer membrane surface of PLOS Computational Biology | hydrophilic protein domains referred to as a protein scaffolds. The scaffolds are intrinsi-cally bent and mold, therefore, the membranes into curved shapes. This action of the scaf-folds requires their concentration on the membrane surface due to inter-scaffold attractive forces originating from membrane deformations. Here we analyze quantitatively the membrane-mediated interaction between two strongly anisotropic and intrinsically curved membrane scaffolds, which mimic realistic proteins. We demonstrate that the scaffold shape anisotropy causes a mutual aligning of the scaffolds and generates a strong attractive interaction bringing the scaffolds close to each other to equilibrium distances much smaller than the scaffold size. We compute the energy of interaction between scaffolds of a realistic geometry to constitute tens of k B T, which guarantees a robust segregation of the scaffolds into domains.},

At non-vanishing lateral tensions, the interaction is found to depend on the orientation of the cones with respect to the membrane plane. The interaction of inclusions of equal orientation is repulsive at all distances between them, while the inclusions of opposite orientation repel each other at small separations, but attract each other at larger ones. Both the repulsive and attractive forces become stronger with increasing lateral tension. This is different from what has been predicted on the basis of the same static model for the case of vanishing lateral tension. Without tension, the inclusions repel each other at all distances independently of their relative orientation.

abstract = {Recently, progress has been made in understanding further the theory of protein aggregation in membranes induced by membrane-mediated elastic deformation. Aggregation may occur when: (i) there is a mis-match in size of the hydrophobic part of the protein with the membrane thickness which leads to a non-monotonic force between proteins associated with the membrane deformation; (ii) the proteins induce a local change in membrane stiffness which couples to the thermal fluctuations of the membranes and engenders a van der Waals-like long range attraction which decays as r-4; (iii) the proteins act as gap junctions pinching together two membranes which are otherwise repelling one another, which produces logarithmic long range attraction which may, in turn, induce aggregation.},

abstract = {Although the Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) reconstituted into phosphatidylcholine (PC) membranes lacking cholesterol and anionic lipids adopts a conformation where agonist binding is uncoupled from channel gating, the underlying mechanism remains to be defined. Here, we examine the mechanism behind lipid-dependent uncoupling by comparing the propensities of two prokaryotic homologs, GLIC and ELIC, to adopt a similar uncoupled conformation. Membrane-reconstituted GLIC and ELIC both exhibit folded structures in the minimal PC membranes that stabilize an uncoupled nAChR. GLIC, with a large number of aromatic interactions at the interface between the outermost transmembrane $\alpha$-helix, M4, and the adjacent transmembrane $\alpha$-helices, M1 and M3, retains the ability to flux cations in this uncoupling PC membrane environment. In contrast, ELIC, with a level of aromatic interactions intermediate between that of the nAChR and GLIC, does not undergo agonist-induced channel gating, even though it does not exhibit the expected biophysical characteristics of the uncoupled state. Engineering new aromatic interactions at the M4-M1/M3 interface to promote effective M4 interactions with M1/M3, however, increases the stability of the transmembrane domain to restore channel function. Our data provide direct evidence that M4 interactions with M1/M3 are modulated during lipid sensing. Aromatic residues strengthen M4 interactions with M1/M3 to reduce the sensitivities of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels to their surrounding membrane environment.},

abstract = {The lipid composition of plasma membranes and tonoplasts from etiolated mung bean hypocotyls was examined in detail. Phospholipids, sterols, and ceramide monohexoside(s) were the major lipid classes in both membranes. The content of phospholipids on a protein basis was higher in the tonoplast, but the content of total sterols was similar in both membranes. Accordingly, the sterol to phospholipid molar ratio in the plasma membrane was higher than that of the tonoplast. Phosphati-dylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine comprised the major phospho-lipids in both membranes. Phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylglycerol were identified as minor phospholipid components. The content of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylglycerol was rela-tively high in the tonoplast, comprising 11 and 5{\%} of the total phospho-lipids, respectively. Although special care was taken against the degra-dative action of phospholipase D and phosphatidic acid phosphatase during the isolation of these membranes, by adding EDTA, EGTA, KF, choline, and ethanolamine to the homogenizing medium, significant amounts of phosphatidic acid, about 15{\%} of the total phospholipids, were detected in the plasma membrane. On the other hand, the content of phosphatidic acid in tonoplasts and other membrane fractions was very low. This fact may indicate that high levels of phosphatidic acid occur naturally in plasma membranes. Phosphatidylglycerol in both membranes and phosphatidylinositol in the tonoplast contained high levels of palmitic acid, which comprised more than 50{\%} of the total fatty acids. Significant differences were observed in the sterol compositions of plasma mem-branes and tonoplasts. More than 90{\%} of the sterols in the plasma membrane were unesterified, while the tonoplast was enriched in glyco-sylated sterols, especially acylated sterylglycosides. Ceramide mono-hexoside was found to be specifically located in these membranes, in particular, in the tonoplast, in which it comprised nearly 17{\%} of the total lipids. Lipids are recognized as major chemical components of bio-membranes and play an important role in cellular activities through control of permeability, fluidity, and membrane-bound},

abstract = {The aim of the study was to investigate the replacement of fish oil by vegetable oils and the effects of a washout with a return to fish oil on growth performances and lipid metabolism. Three experimental fish meal-based isonitrogenous (crude protein content: 57.5{\%}) and isolipidic (crude lipid content: 16.5{\%}) diets were formulated containing either 9{\%} of added fish oil (FO), soybean oil (SO), or linseed oil (LO). Each diet was distributed to triplicate groups of 25 marketable size turbot (initial body weight of 579 g) grown in seawater at water temperature of 17°C. Fish were fed once a day to visual satiety. At the end of the growth trial, which lasted 13 weeks, all groups of turbot were fed with FO diet for 8 weeks. The growth of turbot was high, but the incorporation of vegetable oils in the diets resulted in a slight decrease in growth as compared to those fed with fish oil-based diet. Feed and protein efficiency and whole body composition were not affected by dietary lipid sources. Total lipid content was low in the muscle of turbot (below 2{\%}); ventral muscle being fatter than dorsal muscle. Liver and muscle fatty acid (FA) composition reflected dietary FA composition. Liver and muscle of fish fed with SO diet were rich in 18:2n-6, whereas those of fish fed with LO diet were rich in 18:3n-3. Liver and muscle of fish fed with SO and LO diets had lower levels of 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 in comparison to those of fish fed with FO diet. In turbot, hepatic lipogenic enzyme activities were low and not influenced by dietary lipid source. At the end of the second period, after transfer to FO-based diets, muscle FA composition of fish fed previously with SO and LO diets were still different to those of fish fed with FO diet. The values of 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3, respectively, were lower than the values found at the end of the growth period, but higher than those of fish fed with FO diet. An increase of FA levels, characteristic of fish oil, was observed in the liver and muscle of fish previously fed with vegetable oils. Data obtained show that replacement of fish oil by vegetable oils is possible with negligible impact on growth performance of turbot, that dietary lipids are an effective vector to influence the nutritional quality of finished product, and that a duration of 8 weeks is not sufficient to bring the FA profile of turbot of this size back to that of fish fed with fish oil over the whole period. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum) were fed purified diets containing fish oil for six weeks and then soybean lecithin or soybean oil for 25 days. The gastrointestinal tract segments, stomach, midgut and hindgut were then sampled for lipid and fatty acid composition and electron microscopy. Membrane lipid class composition was fairly similar in all three segments of trout fed fish oil. Hindgut contained slightly more phosphatidylserine than stomach andmidgut,while midgut containedmore phosphatidylcholine and less lysophos- patidylcholine/sphingomyelin. Feeding soybean products appeared to marginally decrease free cholesterol. The fatty acid compositions of the main lipid classes showed significant regional differences. In control fish, stomach had higher levels of arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids than midgut and hindgut, and lower content of docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Midgut phosphatidyleth- anolamine also had higher levels of saturated fatty acids and less n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids than the other tissues. Feeding soybean products decreased the n-3/n-6 ratio mainly due to increases in linoleic (18:2n-6) and 20:4n-6 and decreases in 22:6n-3 and eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3). Phosphatidylcholine and to a lesser extent phosphatidylethanolamine adapted more readily to dietary changes by major increases in 18:2n-6 and C20−22 n- 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids. The composition of phosphatidyl-serine and -inositol appeared to be under more strict metabolic control. Linoleic acid hardly increased at all while the increase in other n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids was less pronounced than for the other lipid classes. Regardless of lipid class, stomach resisted dietary changes more strongly than midgut and hindgut. Increases in n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids were minor as were the loss of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. The dead-end product 20:2n-6 accumulated to a higher degree in hindgut phosphatidyl-ethanolamineand -coline compared tomidgut and stomach, suggesting that the activity of6 desaturation is higher in the anterior part of the intestine where most of the lipid is absorbed. Feeding soybean oil caused massive accumulation of free lipid droplets in midgut enterocytes while little lipid droplets were observed in trout fed fish oil or soybean lecithin.

abstract = {We present a refined model of the membrane-associated Torpedo acetylcholine (ACh) receptor at 4 {\AA} resolution. An improved experimental density map was obtained from 342 electron images of helical tubes, and the refined structure was derived to an R-factor of 36.7{\%} (Rfree37.9{\%}) by standard crystallographic methods, after placing the densities corresponding to a single molecule into an artificial unit cell. The agreement between experimental and calculated phases along the helical layer-lines was used to monitor progress in the refinement and to give an independent measure of the accuracy. The atomic model allowed a detailed description of the whole receptor in the closed-channel form, including the ligand-binding and intracellular domains, which have not previously been interpreted at a chemical level. We confirm that the two ligand-binding $\alpha$ subunits have a different extended conformation from the three other subunits in the closed channel, and identify several interactions on both pairs of subunit interfaces, and within the $\alpha$ subunits, which may be responsible for their "distorted" structures. The ACh-coordinating amino acid side-chains of the $\alpha$ subunits are far apart in the closed channel, indicating that a localised rearrangement, involving closure of loops B and C around the bound ACh molecule, occurs upon activation. A comparison of the structure of the $\alpha$ subunit with that of AChBP having ligand present, suggests how the localised rearrangement overcomes the distortions and initiates the rotational movements associated with opening of the channel. Both vestibules of the channel are strongly electronegative, providing a cation-stabilising environment at either entrance of the membrane pore. Access to the pore on the intracellular side is further influenced by narrow lateral windows, which would be expected to screen out electrostatically ions of the wrong charge and size. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Solid-state NMR methods employing 2H NMR and geometric analysis of labeled alanines (GALA) were used to study the structure and orientation of the transmembrane $\alpha$-helical peptide acetyl-GWW(LA)8LWWA-amide (WALP23) in phosphatidylcholine (PC) bilayers of varying thickness. In all lipids the peptide was found to adopt a transmembrane $\alpha$-helical conformation. A small tilt angle of 4.5° was observed in di-18:1-PC, which has a hydrophobic bilayer thickness that approximately matches the hydrophobic length of the peptide. This tilt angle increased slightly but systematically with increasing positive mismatch to 8.2° in di-C12:0-PC, the shortest lipid used. This small increase in tilt angle is insufficient to significantly change the effective hydrophobic length of the peptide and thereby to compensate for the increasing hydrophobic mismatch, suggesting that tilt of these peptides in a lipid bilayer is energetically unfavorable. The tilt and also the orientation around the peptide axis were found to be very similar to the values previously reported for a shorter WALP19 peptide (GWW(LA)6LWWA). As also observed in this previous study, the peptide rotates rapidly around the bilayer normal, but not around its helix axis. Here we show that these properties allow application of the GALA method not only to macroscopically aligned samples but also to randomly oriented samples, which has important practical advantages. A minimum of four labeled alanine residues in the hydrophobic transmembrane sequence was found to be required to obtain accurate tilt values using the GALA method.},

Analogously, the postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor may be considered the quantum of fast chemical to electrical transduction. Our understanding of postsynaptic receptors began to develop about a hundred years ago with the demonstration that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve released acetylcholine and slowed the heart beat. During the past 50 years, advances in understanding postsynaptic receptors increased at a rapid pace, owing largely to studies of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) at the motor endplate. The endplate AChR belongs to a large superfamily of neurotransmitter receptors, called Cys-loop receptors, and has served as an exemplar receptor for probing fundamental structures and mechanisms that underlie fast synaptic transmission in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Recent studies provide an increasingly detailed picture of the structure of the AChR and the symphony of molecular motions that underpin its remarkably fast and efficient chemoelectrical transduction.},

To reproduce the free energies of these chemical building blocks, the number of possible interaction levels of the coarse-grained sites has increased compared to those of the previous model. Application of the new model to lipid bilayers shows an improved behavior in terms of the stress profile across the bilayer and the tendency to form pores. An extension of the force field now also allows the simulation of planar (ring) compounds, including sterols.

abstract = {Transglutaminases (TGases; EC 2.3.2.13) are a family of enzymes that catalyze calcium-dependent covalent cross-linking of cellular proteins by establishing epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl)lysine isopeptide bonds. These covalent isopeptide bonds are of great physiological significance because they are highly resistant to proteolysis, denaturants, and reducing agents. Prior studies have demonstrated the presence of isopeptide bonds in the sheath and cuticle of filarial parasites, suggesting an important role for TGase-catalyzed reactions during the growth and development of filarial nematodes. Herein we report the identification and cloning of a cDNA encoding a TGase from the dog heartworm Dirofilaria immitis (DiTG). The DiTG expressed in Escherichia coli (recombinant DiTG) was able to catalyze calcium-dependent cross-linking reactions. The derived amino acid sequence of the DiTG cDNA (pDiTG) predicts a protein of 57.1 kDa and includes an N-terminal hydrophobic signal peptide. The pDiTG has no sequence similarity with any of the known TGases, but it has significant homology to protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and, particularly, to the PDI-related endoplasmic reticulum protein ERp60, a PDI isoform found in the lumen of endoplasmic reticulum. As predicted from the amino acid sequence homology, recombinant DiTG catalyzed the isomerization of intramolecular disulfide/sulfhydryl bonds in denatured RNase in vitro as effectively as did mammalian PDI. Conversely, purified PDI from bovine liver could catalyze protein cross-linking reactions in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. This report describes the dual catalytic activity of TGase and PDI in post- and/or cotranslational modification of newly synthesized proteins. These TGase-catalyzed posttranslational modifications may play a pivotal role in the synthesis of new cuticle during the growth and maturation of filarial parasites.},

abstract = {Hyperlipidemia is common in diabetic patients. While our understanding of lipid and lipoprotein me-tabolism in diabetes is incomplete, a pathophysiologic approach to this problem is presented. It is based on the recognition that diabetes is metabolically heterogeneous. Thus the roles of insulin deficiency, insulin resistance, obesity, and genetic factors are discussed in relation to their effects on lipoprotein production and catabolism. The most important defect in insulin-deficient subjects appears to be a defi-ciency of lipoprotein lipase, which is responsible for the removal of the triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. In non-insulin-dependent subjects there is evidence for a removal defect as well as, in some patients, for overproduction of VLDL-triglyceride. Cholesterol levels may be elevated and it is important to distin-guish between VLDL, LDL, and HDL as the causes for these increases. HDL-cholesterol levels may be increased in insulin-dependent subjects, whereas they may be decreased in obese non-insulin-dependent patients. Mild elevations of LDL-cholesterol may occur in inadequately controlled type I and II diabetic patients, while elevated VLDL may raise the serum cholesterol in addition to the triglyceride levels. The rationale for therapy is based on the complications of severe hypertriglyceridemia and the risk of occlu-sive atherosclerosis. Management is directed at improving glycemic control, altering dietary composi-tion, and reducing calories in obese patients. Improved glycemic control is effective in reducing triglyc-eride and cholesterol levels in insulin-deficient subjects. The response of the non-insulin-dependent diabetic patient to improved control may be complicated by associated obesity or familial hyperlipide-mia. The advantages and disadvantages of fat versus carbohydrate restriction in the diet are discussed. Finally, resistant hyperlipidemia may require drug therapy. Diabetic hyperlipidemia should be viewed as resulting from an interaction between the diabetic syndrome, the genetic background of the patient, and the environment, DIABETES CARE 4. -561-572, SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER i98i. A n association between hyperlipidemia and dia-betic ketoacidosis was first demonstrated by Bloor in 1916. 1 It has since been appreciated that blood lipids are fairly commonly elevated among ambulant diabetic patients. 2 " 6 In view of the predisposition for the development of atherosclerotic vascular disease in the diabetic, attention has been focused on lipid and lipoprotein levels and metabolism in diabetes. This review provides a pathophysiologic approach to the lipid abnormalities in dia-betes, and will stress the important metabolic differences be-tween type I (insulin-dependent) and type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes.

  abstract = {The effects of lipids on the maintenance of characteristic functional properties of the acetylcholine receptor during the course of reconstitution into lipid vesicles were studied by following the kinetics of agonist-induced state transitions. The requirements for successful preservation of these properties could be dissected into two components: (a) adequate nature and concentration of lipids during detergent solubilization; (b) correct lipid environment during reincorporation into lipid vesicles by the cholate dialysis procedure. Optimal bulk lipid concentrations and lipid:cholate ratios for preserving state transitions during solubilization were studied by using both crude soybean lipids and pure synthetic phospholipids. The latter class of lipids was found to be unsuitable substitutes for the crude soybean lipids, irrespective of their polar head group and/or fatty acyl chain, even when detergent:lipid ratios as high as 1:1 (w/w) were employed. Addition of cholesteryl hemisuccinate was able to make up this deficiency, attaining preservation of acetylcholine receptor state transitions at cholate:steroid ratios of about 6:1 (w/w). The presence of steroid decreased the amount of protein solubilized. The correct choice of lipid type was also essential to the reincorporation step, and higher concentrations of lipid were required--about 20 mg/mL for soybean lipids. Pure phospholipids at similar concentrations, however, were unable to maintain the state transitions. Again, steroid (40-46{\%} cholesteryl hemisuccinate/mol of total lipid) provided the adequate conditions at the reincorporation stage and enhanced the amount of protein reincorporated into the vesicles. A large (70-90{\%}) percentage of the receptor was reincorporated with the correct vectorial sidedness. No specificity could be detected for the phospholipid polar head or alkyl chain in relation to any of these findings. The effect of the protein on the physical state of the lipids in the reconstituted vesicles was studied by diphenylhexatriene fluorescence depolarization. The results may be interpreted as a disordering of the acyl chains in the gel state and an ordering in the liquid-crystalline state in the presence of protein, accompanied by shifts in the transition temperatures of the pure phospholipids to lower values.},

The GROMACS software consists of a preprocessor, a parallel MD and energy minimization program that can use an arbitrary number of processors (including one), an optional monitor, and several analysis tools. The programs are written in ANSI C and available by ftp (information: gromacs@chem.rug.nl). The functionality is based on the GROMOS (GROningen MOlecular Simulation) package (van Gunsteren and Berendsen, 1987; BIOMOS B.V., Nijenborgh 4, 9747 AG Groningen). Conversion programs between GROMOS and GROMACS formats are included. The MD program can handle rectangular periodic boundary conditions with temperature and pressure scaling. The interactions that can be handled without modification are variable non-bonded pair interactions with Coulomb and Lennard-Jones or Buckingham potentials, using a twin-range cut-off based on charge groups, and fixed bonded interactions of either harmonic or constraint type for bonds and bond angles and either periodic or cosine power series interactions for dihedral angles. Special forces can be added to groups of particles (for non-equilibrium dynamics or for position restraining) or between particles (for distance restraints). The parallelism is based on particle decomposition. Interprocessor communication is largely limited to position and force distribution over the ring once per time step. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by degeneration of motoneurons and skeletal muscle atrophy. In its most severe form, it leads to death before the age of 2 years. While primary degeneration of motor neurons is well established in this disease, and this results in neurogenic atrophy of skeletal muscle, we have previously reported evidence for a primary muscle defect. In this study, we used primary cultures of embryonic human skeletal muscle cells from patients with SMA and from controls to examine the effects of muscle fiber differentiation in the absence of a nerve component. Cultured SMA skeletal muscle cells are unable to fuse correctly to form multinuclear myotubes, the precursors of the myofibers. We also show that agrin-induced aggregates of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, one of the earliest steps of neuromuscular junction formation, cannot be visualized by confocal microscopy on cells from SMA patients. In binding experiments, we demonstrate that this lack of clustering is due to defective expression of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the myotubes of SMA patients whereas the affinity of alpha-bungarotoxin for its receptor remains unchanged regardless of muscle cell type (SMA or control). These observations suggest that muscle cells from SMA patients have intrinsic abnormalities that may affect proper formation of the neuromuscular junction.},

abstract = {Dietary supplementation with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially those of the nҀ3 class, has immunosuppressive effects on both innate and adaptive immunity through various mechanisms. In this review, we focus on the PUFA modulation of membrane archi-tecture and its consequent effects on both T cell responses and antigen presentation. We first use data from in vitro and in vivo experiments to make the case that the immunosuppressive effects of PUFAs begin with membrane incorporation and modulation of lipid-protein lateral organization. This in turn inhibits downstream sig-naling mediated by T cell receptors and suppresses T cell activation and proliferation. Next, we review evidence for PUFA-mediated alteration of major histocompatibility complex class I and II surface expression and antigen presentation. We propose that PUFAs influ-ence the expression of major histocompatibility complex by altering its conformation, orientation, lateral organization, and trafficking, with consequences for recognition by effector T cells. Finally, we present data from model membrane studies to explain the physical principles that make PUFA acyl chains unique in modifying mem-brane lateral organization and protein function. An important con-cept to emerge from these studies is that PUFA acyl chains and cholesterol molecules are sterically incompatible. By applying this concept to the T cell activation and signaling model, mechanisms emerge by which PUFAs can modulate membrane lipid-protein lat-eral organization. Our data-based models show that membrane mod-ification of both effectors and targets is an important, often over-looked, mechanism of immunomodulation by PUFAs.},

abstract = {Many biologically interesting phenomena occur on a time scale that is too long to be studied by atomistic simulations. These phenomena include the dynamics of large proteins and self-assembly of biological materials. Coarse-grained (CG) molecular modeling allows computer simulations to be run on length and time scales that are 2–3 orders of magnitude larger compared to atomistic simulations, providing a bridge between the atomistic and the mesoscopic scale. We developed a new CG model for proteins as an extension of the MARTINI force field. Here, we validate the model for its use in peptide-bilayer systems. In order to validate the model, we calculated the potential of mean force for each amino acid as a function of its distance from the center of a dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) lipid bilayer. We then compared amino acid association constants, the partitioning of a series of model pentapeptides, the partitioning and orientation of WALP23 in DOPC lipid bilayers and a series of KALP peptides in dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers. A comparison with results obtained from atomistic models shows good agreement in all of the tests performed. We also performed a systematic investigation of the partitioning of five series of polyalanine−leucine peptides (with different lengths and compositions) in DPPC bilayers. As expected, the fraction of peptides partitioned at the interface increased with decreasing peptide length and decreasing leucine content, demonstrating that the CG model is capable of discriminating partitioning behavior arising from subtle differences in the amino acid composition. Finally, we simulated the concentration-dependent formation of transmembrane pores by magainin, an antimicrobial peptide. In line with atomistic simulation studies, disordered toroidal pores are formed. In conclusion, the model is computationally efficient and effectively reproduces peptide−lipid interactions and the partitioning of amino acids and peptides in lipid bilayers.},

Free energy calculations show that the enthalpic contribution due to the packing of the lipids drives the lateral sorting of the helices. Hydrophobic mismatch regulates the clustering into either small dynamic or large static aggregates.

PAMs have been classified only on the basis of their macroscopic effects as type I, which only enhance agonist-induced currents, and type II, which also decrease desensitization and reactivate desensitized nAChRs. To decipher the molecular basis underlying these distinct activities, we explored the effects on single-$\alpha$7 channel currents of representative members of each type and of less characterized compounds. Our results reveal that all PAMs enhance open-channel lifetime and produce episodes of successive openings, thus indicating that both types affect $\alpha$7 kinetics. Different PAM types show different sensitivity to temperature, suggesting different mechanisms of potentiation. By using a mutant $\alpha$7 receptor that is insensitive to the prototype type II PAM (PNU-120596), we show that some though not all type I PAMs share the structural determinants of potentiation. Overall, our study provides novel information on $\alpha$7 potentiation, which is key to the ongoing development of therapeutic compounds.},

Agonist binding leads to rapid signal transduction via an allosteric mechanism, where global protein conformational changes open a pore across the nerve cell membrane. We use all-atom molecular dynamics with a swarm-based string method to solve for the minimum free-energy gating pathways of the proton-activated bacterial GLIC channel. We describe stable wetted/open and dewetted/closed states, and uncover conformational changes in the agonist-binding extracellular domain, ion-conducting transmembrane domain, and gating interface that control communication between these domains. Transition analysis is used to compute free-energy surfaces that suggest allosteric pathways; stabilization with pH; and intermediates, including states that facilitate channel closing in the presence of an agonist. We describe a switching mechanism that senses proton binding by marked reorganization of subunit interface, altering the packing of $\beta$-sheets to induce changes that lead to asynchronous pore-lining M2 helix movements. These results provide molecular details of GLIC gating and insight into the allosteric mechanisms for the superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated channels.},

The PDMS microchip used herein contains 60 chambers, each with posts able to passively capture single GUVs without compromising their integrity. The design allows for circular valves to be lowered from the channel ceiling to isolate the vesicles from rest of the channel network. GUVs containing calcein were trapped and by rapidly opening the valves, the membrane pore protein $\alpha$-hemolysin ($\alpha$HL) was introduced to the membrane. Confocal microscopy revealed the kinetics of the small molecule efflux for different protein concentrations. This microfluidic approach greatly improves the number of experiments possible and can be applied to a wide range of biophysical applications.},

abstract = {The conformational properties of the acyls of biological membranes - hydrocarbon chains with isolated cis double bonds - were studied by computer simulation. The Monte Carlo method was used, with continuous variation of bond rotation angles within the (0, 360°) range considered. It has been shown, that if all double bonds of molecules are separated only by one methylene group, and their number in the chain is maximum, the molecule is characterized by the highest equilibrium flexibility (at temperatures only encountered by biological systems) as compared to any similar molecules. It is such a structure which is inherent to docosahexaenoic acid. The above molecule coefficient that characterizes the temperature sensitivity of the molecule sizes is 10-times lower than that of a saturated chain. The polyunsaturated chain segment with high probability assumes the extended (in perfect crystal structures the 'angle iron-shaped') conformation when all the molecules are efficiently packed below the phase-transition temperatures. The annular lipid layer of embedded enzymes is assumed to be enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acid acyls. The above physical properties of polyunsaturated chains are bound to favour the maintenance of the proper conformational mobility of biomembrane enzymes, to relax the negative influence of environmental temperature changes on their activity. When freezing biological membranes they are bound to provide the molecule packing which is free of high tensions. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {Using neutron diffraction Harroun et al. [(2006) Biochemistry 45, 1227-1233; (2008) Biochemistry 47, 7090-7096] carried out studies that unequivocally demonstrated cholesterol preferentially sequestering in the middle of bilayers (i.e., flat orientation) made of lipids with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), in contrast to its "usual" position where its hydroxyl group locates near the lipid/water interface (i.e., upright orientation). Here we clearly show, using neutron diffraction, cholesterol's orientational preference in different lipid bilayers. For example, although it requires 50 mol {\%} POPC (16:0-18:1 PC) in DAPC (di20:4 PC) bilayers to cause cholesterol to revert to its upright orientation, only 5 mol {\%} DMPC (di14:0 PC) is needed to achieve the same effect. This result demonstrates not only cholesterol's affinity for saturated hydrocarbon chains, but also its aversion for PUFAs. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations performed on similar systems show that in high PUFA content bilayers cholesterol is simultaneously capable of assuming different orientations within a bilayer. Although this result is known from previous MD studies by Marrink et al. [(2008) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 130, 10-11], it has yet to be confirmed experimentally. Importantly, MD simulations predict the formation of DMPC-rich domains, data corroborated by experiment (i.e., 10 mol {\%} DMPC-doped DAPC bilayers), where cholesterol preferentially locates in its upright orientation, while in DMPC-depleted domains cholesterol is found mostly in the bilayer center (i.e., flat orientation). These results lend credence to DMPC's aversion for PUFAs, supporting the notion that domain formation is primarily driven by lipids.},

abstract = {Mixtures of unsaturated lipids, sphingolipids, and cholesterol form coexisting liquid-disordered and sphingolipid and cholesterol-rich liquid-ordered (Lo) phases in water. The detergent Triton X-100 does not readily solubilize Lo domains, but does solubilize liquid-disordered domains, and is commonly used to prepare detergent-resistant membranes from cells and model membranes. However, it has been proposed that in membranes with mixtures of sphingomyelin (SM), 1-palmitoyl 2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC), and cholesterol Triton X-100 may induce Lo domain formation, and therefore detergent-resistant membranes may not reflect the presence of preexisting domains. To examine this hypothesis, the effect of Triton on Lo domain formation was measured in SM/POPC/cholesterol vesicles. Nitroxide quenching methods that can detect ordered nanodomains with radii {\textgreater}12 showed that in the absence of Triton X-100 this mixture formed ordered state domains that melt with a midpoint (= T mid) at ∼45°C. However, T mid was lower when detected using various fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) pairs. Furthermore, the T mid value was Ro dependent, and decreased as Ro increased. Because FRET can only readily detect domains with radii {\textgreater}Ro, this result can be explained by domain radii that are close to Ro and decrease as temperature increases. An analysis of FRET and quenching data suggests that nanodomain radius gradually decreases from ≥150 to {\textless}40 as temperature increases from 10 to 45°C. Interestingly, the presence of Triton X-100 or a transmembrane-type peptide did not stabilize ordered state formation when detected by nitroxide quenching, i.e., did not increase T mid. However, FRET-detected T mid did increase in the presence of Triton X-100 or a transmembrane peptide, indicating that both increased domain size. Controls showed that the results could not be accounted for by probe-induced perturbations. Thus, SM/POPC/cholesterol, a mixture similar to that in the outer leaflet of plasma membranes, forms nanodomains at physiological temperatures, and TX-100 does not induce domain formation or increase the fraction of the bilayer in the ordered state, although it does increase domain size by coalescing preexisting domains. {\textcopyright} 2011 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {The plasma membrane (PM) serves as the functional interface between a cell and its environment, hosting extracellular signal transduction and nutrient transport among a variety of other processes. To support this extensive functionality, PMs are organized into lateral domains, including ordered, lipid-driven assemblies termed lipid rafts. Although the general requirements for ordered domain formation are well established, how these domains are regulated by cell-endogenous mechanisms or exogenous perturbations has not been widely addressed. In this context, an intriguing possibility is that dietary fats can incorporate into membrane lipids to regulate the properties and physiology of raft domains. Here, we investigate the effects of polyunsaturated fats on the organization of membrane domains across a spectrum of membrane models, including computer simulations, synthetic lipid membranes, and intact PMs isolated from mammalian cells. We observe that the $\omega$-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid is robustly incorporated into membrane lipids, and this incorporation leads to significant remodeling of the PM lipidome. Across model systems, docosahexaenoic acid-containing lipids enhance the stability of ordered raft domains by increasing the order difference between them and coexisting nonraft domains. The relationship between interdomain order disparity and the stability of phase separation holds for a spectrum of different perturbations, including manipulation of cholesterol levels and high concentrations of exogenous amphiphiles, suggesting it as a general feature of the organization of biological membranes. These results demonstrate that polyunsaturated fats affect the composition and organization of biological membranes, suggesting a potential mechanism for the extensive effects of dietary fat on health and disease.},

Diagnosis of Alzheimer-type disease was based on the presence of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in post-mortem sections. Several highly significant and specific differences were observed between the two groups. Adrenic acid (22:4 n-6) was three to four times higher in the grey matter but lower in the white matter in each of the three regions in the Alzheimer brains than in the control group. These alterations were compensated by reciprocal changes in 18:0 in the grey matter and 16:1 fatty acids in the white matter. There was no significant difference in the proportion of other fatty acids, including those of the n-6 and n-3 series, in either the grey or the white matter of any of the three regions of the two groups, except for a higher proportion of 22:6 n-3 in the parietal white matter in the Alzheimer patients. There was no significant relationship between the levels of the individual fatty acids and age at death. It is suggested that the alterations in the fatty acid composition observed in the brains of Alzheimer patients may be caused by an aberration in the system by which essential fatty acids are transported into the brain},

abstract = {J. Neurochem. (2012) 122, 427443. Abstract Dietary lipids modify brain fatty acid profile, but evidence of their direct effect on neuronal function is sparse. The enthorinal cortex (EC) neurons connecting to the hippocampus play a critical role in learning and memory. Here, we have exposed mice to diets based on canola:soybean oils (40 : 10, g/kg) or safflower : corn oils (25 : 25, g/kg) to investigate the relationship between the lipid profile of brain fatty acids and the intrinsic properties of EC neurons. Consumption of canola : soybean oil-enriched diet led to the increase of the monounsaturated fatty acid oleic acid and to a decrease of arachidonic acid in ethanolamine glycerophospholipids of the white matter. We also found an important rise in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) within ethanolamine glycerophospholipids and phosphatidylserine of gray matter. The canola:soybean oil treatment led to a shorter duration of action potential (-21{\%}), a reduction in the duration of postsynaptic response (-21{\%}) and increased firing activity (+43{\%}). Data from additional experiments with animals fed DHA alone or DHA with canola oil suggested that dietary monounsaturated fatty acid may have contributed to these effects on EC neuron physiology. Since neuronal function within the enthorhinal-hippocampal loop is critical to learning and memory processes, the present data may provide a functional basis for the beneficial cognitive effects of canola oil-based diets.},

The membrane perturbation energy increases with the inclusion radius. The Ornstein-Zernike theory, with the Percus-Yevick closure, is used to calculate the radial distribution function of inclusions. We find that when the spontaneous curvature is zero, the interaction between inclusions due to the membrane deformation is qualitatively similar to the hard-core interaction.

Native, alkaline-extracted nAChR membranes from Torpedo are dried under nitrogen on either a plastic microscope coverslip or a germanium internal reflection element (IRE) and then equilibrated with buffer. The drying procedure has no effect on the functional state of the nAChR as judged by a fluorescence assay using the probe ethidium bromide. The times required for an acetylcholine analogue (carbamylcholine), a local anesthetic (dibucaine), and a fluorescent probe (ethidium bromide) to penetrate films of varying degrees of thickness, interact with the receptor, and then to be washed from the films have been established. Under these conditions, the nAChR films can be repetitively cycled between the resting and desensitized states. Both fluorescence and infrared spectroscopy show that the films adhere strongly to either support even with buffer flowing continuously past the film surface. Fourier transform infrared difference spectra calculated from spectra recorded in the presence and absence of carbamylcholine show small, reproducible bands which reflect changes in nAChR structure upon desensitization. {\textcopyright} 1992, The Biophysical Society.

abstract = {Anestrous ewes respond to the introduction of rams with either an ovulation within 2-3 days that may be followed by luteal phases of normal or short length, with delayed ovulations (5-6 days later), or with the luteinization of follicles. The aim of this work was to study the relationship between the growth status of the largest follicle present when rams are introduced and the type of ovarian response in non-treated ewes and in ewes treated with estradiol-17beta before ram introduction. Thirteen anestrous Corriedale ewes were divided into 2 groups: E2 (n = 7) and C (n = 6). The E2 ewes received a single dose of 50 microg estradiol-17beta 5 days before the introduction of the rams to synchronize the onset of their follicle waves, while C ewes remained untreated. When the rams were introduced, all E2 ewes had the largest follicle in a growing stage in contrast with the C ewes (3 out of 6; P {\textless} 0.05). Five C and 4 E2 ewes ovulated after the introduction of the rams (Day 3.4 +/- 0.4 for C vs. 4.8 +/- 0.3 for E2 ewes, respectively, P {\textless} 0.05). Only one ewe from each group developed a normal luteal phase: 4 C and 3 E2 ewes had short luteal phases. One C ewe and 2 E2 ewes had short luteal phases originating from follicles that did not ovulate. After the first luteal phase, all ewes returned to anesirus without a second ovulation or luteal phase. The remaining E2 ewe did not ovulate or show any changes in progesterone serum concentrations. We conclude that the growth status of the largest follicle alone does not determine the ovarian responding pattern of anestrous ewes to the ram effect.},

abstract = {In this review, changes in brain lipid composition and metabolism due to aging are outlined. The most striking changes in cerebral cortex and cerebellum lipid composition involve an increase in acidic phospholipid synthesis. The most important changes with respect to fatty acyl composition involve a decreased content in polyunsaturated fatty acids (20:4n-6, 22:4n-6, 22:6n-3) and an in-creased content in monounsaturated fatty acids (18:1n-9 and 20:1n-9), mainly in ethanolamine and serineglycerophospholipids. Changes in the activity of the enzymes modifying the phospholipid headgroup occur during aging. Serine incorporation into phosphatidylserine through base-exchange reactions and phosphatidylcholine synthesis through phosphatidylethanolamine methy-lation increases in the aged brain. Phosphatidate phosphohydrolase and phospholipase D activities are also altered in the aged brain thus producing changes in the lipid second messengers diacyl-glycerol and phosphatidic acid.},

abstract = {The diffusion coefficients of proteins embedded in a lipid membrane are traditionally described by the hydrodynamic Saffman-Delbr¨ uck theory, which predicts a weak dependence of the diffusion coefficient on protein radius, D ∼ lnR. Recent experiments have observed a stronger dependence, D ∼ 1/R.Thishas ledto speculation that the primary sources of drag on the protein are not hydrodynamic, but originate in coupling to other fields, such as lipid chain stretching or tilt.We discuss a generic model of a protein coupled to a nonconserved scalar order parameter (e.g., chain stretching), and show that earlier results may not be as universal as previously believed. In particular,we note that the drag depends on theway the protein-order parameter coupling is imposed. In this model,D ∼ 1/R can be obtained if the protein is much larger than the order parameter correlation length. However, if we modify the model to include advection of the order parameter, which is a more appropriate assumption for a fluid membrane, we find that the entrainment of the order parameter by the protein's motion significantly changes the scaling of the diffusion coefficient. For parameters appropriate to protein diffusion, the Saffman-Delbr¨ uck-like scaling is restored, but with an effective radius for the protein that depends on the order parameter's correlation length. This qualitative difference suggests that hydrodynamic effects cannot be neglected in the computation of drag on a protein interacting with the membrane.},

abstract = {Three types of analogues of unsaturated phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) have been prepared: phosphatidyl-omega-amino-1-alkanols, N-alkyl-PE's, and C2-alkyl-PE's, with alkyl substitution of carbon-2 of the ethanolamine head group. The physical properties of dioleoyl, dielaidoyl, and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phospholipids with these head groups have been examined by calorimetry, 31P NMR, freeze-fracture electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. N-Alkylation of PE, or substitution of the ethanolamine moiety by 3-amino-1-propanol or 4-amino-1-butanol, decreases the transition temperature of the hydrated gel phase (Tc) and considerably increases the temperature of the lamellar to hexagonal II transition (TH). The pattern of these effects for various PE analogues suggests that head group size and hydrophobicity as well as hydrogen bonding are important determinants of the phase behavior of these lipids. C2-Alkylated PE analogues exhibit several rather surprising properties, notably the ready formation of a quasi-crystalline "high-melting" solid phase even for di-cis-unsaturated species and substantially lower TH values than are observed for the parent PE species. The behavior of these compounds suggests that "hydration forces" can be more important than considerations of lipid "dynamic shape" in predicting the relative stabilities of lamellar vs. nonlamellar phases for at least some zwitterionic phospholipids.},

abstract = {Using Fourier-transform infrared resonance spectroscopy, we examined the structure of the purified Torpedo californica nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in reconstituted dioleoylphosphatidylcholine membranes in H2O and D2O. Using the amide-I band, we calculated the secondary structure of nAChR in H2O to be approx. 19{\%} $\alpha$-helix, 42{\%} $\beta$-structure, 24{\%} turns and 15{\%} unordered. The secondary structure content in D2O was estimated to be 14{\%} $\alpha$-helix, 37{\%} $\beta$-structure, 29{\%} turns and 20{\%} unordered. In the presence of phosphatidic acid the $\beta$-structure content in D2O increased significantly from 37{\%} to 42{\%}. This suggests that an ionic interaction between negatively-charged lipid head groups and positively-charged peptide side chains may stabilize a $\beta$-structure conformation that is necessary for receptor function. The inclusion of cholesterol in the reconstituted membranes significantly increased the $\alpha$-helix content from 14{\%} to 17{\%}. These results support the hypothesis that cholesterol may induce a transmembrane region to undergo a unordered-to-helix transition which is necessary to maintain the integrity of the ion channel. Additionally, we found that nAChR did not undergo major secondary structure changes when subjected to conditions that induce desensitization. This is consistent with the view that the mechanism of desensitization consists of small quaternary rearrangements of the subunits rather than large changes in receptor secondary structure. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

In humans, omnivorous primates, and piglets, DHA and ARA plasma and red blood cells concentrations rise with dietary preformed DHA and ARA. Brain and retina DHA are responsive to diet while ARA is not. DHA is at highest concentration in cells and tissues associated with high energy consumption, consistent with high DHA levels in mitochondria and synaptosomes. DHA is a substrate for docosanoids, signaling compounds of intense current interest. The high concentration in tissues with high rates of oxidative metabolism may be explained by a critical role related to oxidative metabolism.},

abstract = {We present an elastic Hamiltonian for membrane energetics that captures bilayer undulation and peristaltic deformations over all wavelengths, including the short wavelength protrusion regime. The model implies continuous functional forms for thermal undulation and peristaltic amplitudes as a function of wavelength and predicts previously overlooked relationships between these curves. Undulation and peristaltic spectra display excellent agreement with data from both atomistic and coarse-grained models over all simulated length scales. Additionally, the model accurately predicts the bilayer's response to a cylindrical protein inclusion as observed in coarse-grained simulation. This elastic response provides an explanation for gramicidin ion channel lifetime versus membrane thickness data that requires no fit constants. The physical parameters inherent to this picture may be expressed in terms of familiar material properties associated with lipid monolayers. Inclusion of a finite monolayer spontaneous curvature is essential to obtain fully consistent agreement between theory and the full range of available simulation/experimental data. {\textcopyright} 2006 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {To understand the effects of lipid composition on membrane protein function in a mixture as complex as a biomembrane, one must know whether the lipid composition local to the protein differs from the mean lipid composition. In this study, we simulated the transmembrane domain of a $\beta$-barrel protein, OmpA, in mixtures of lipids of different tail lengths under conditions of negative hydrophobic mismatch, i.e., local bilayer thinning. We modeled the influence of OmpA on the local lipid composition both at a coarse-grained (CG) resolution using conventional molecular dynamics, and at an atomistic resolution within the semi-grand canonical ensemble using mutation moves to rapidly approach an equilibrium lateral distribution of lipids. Moderate enrichment of the shorter tail component (either DDPC in DDPC/DMPC mixtures or DMPC in DMPC/DSPC mixtures) extending 2-3 nm away from the protein surface was observed with both the atomistic and CG models. The similarity in trends suggests that the more computationally economical CG models capture the essential features of lipid sorting induced by hydrophobic mismatch. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the Biophysical Society.},

Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we have studied model membranes comprising ???7000 lipids and 16 identical copies of model cylindrical proteins of either ??-helical or ??-barrel types. Through variation of the lipid tail length and hence the degree of hydrophobic mismatch, our simulations display levels of protein aggregation ranging from negligible to extensive. The nature and extent of aggregation are shown to be influenced by membrane curvature and the shape or orientation of the protein. Interestingly, a model ??-barrel protein aggregates to form one-dimensional strings within the bilayer plane, whereas a model ??-helical bundle forms two-dimensional clusters. Overall, it is clear that the nature and extent of membrane protein aggregation is dependent on several aspects of the proteins and lipids, including hydrophobic mismatch, protein class and shape, and membrane curvature. ?? 2011 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Tyrosine phosphorylation is one of the key covalent modifications that occurs in multicellular organisms as a result of intercellular communication during embryogenesis and maintenance of adult tissues. The enzymes that carry out this modification are the protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), which catalyze the transfer of the phosphate of ATP to tyrosine residues on protein substrates. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues modulates enzymatic activity and creates binding sites for the recruitment of downstream signaling proteins. Two classes of PTKs are present in cells: the transmembrane receptor PTKs and the nonreceptor PTKs. Because PTKs are critical components of cellular signaling pathways, their catalytic activity is strictly regulated. Over the past several years, high-resolution structural studies of PTKs have provided a molecular basis for understanding the mechanisms by which receptor and nonreceptor PTKs are regulated. This review will highlight the important results that have emerged from these structural studies.},

abstract = {Interactions with membrane lipids can exert dramatic functional consequences on gap junction proteins. Recent experimental work has highlighted the importance of anionic lipids and cholesterol in facilitating channel activity. In this work, we have employed a coarse-grained molecular model in conjunction with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the interactions between a connexin 26 (Cx26) hemichannel and a number of lipid species, including palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC), anionic palmitoyloleoylphosphatidic acid (POPA), and cholesterol, in order to identify sites at the protein interface which may exhibit preferential, specific binding to these lipids, as well as determine the characteristics of these interactions. We have also employed an atomistic model of Cx26 embedded in a mixed PA/PC bilayer as a comparison and to elucidate further lipid-protein interactions. Our simulation results suggest enrichment of interfacial PA at the intracellular leaflet at high bulk PA concentrations. PC can form tight binding interactions with the hemichannel, particularly at intersubunit crevices (classical nonannular sites). In mixed bilayers, however, POPA competes with POPC for these sites, displacing the latter in some cases. While the residues responsible for interactions with PC and PA are similar, the latter exhibits a unique property of being capable of forming stable hydrophilic contacts with multiple residues spanning two different adjacent subunits at both leaflets of the bilayer, as opposed to POPC which can only do so at the extracellular side. These results suggest that POPA may be essential to channel function by acting as an intersubunit lipid bridge. Additionally, we propose that the compositional enrichment of POPA at the Cx26 interface may serve important roles in voltage gating. Simulation of a mixed POPC:cholesterol bilayer suggests that the hemichannel enhances the transbilayer mobility of vicinal cholesterols, increasing the likelihood of site-hopping and interleaflet flip-flop transitions.},

abstract = {Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is used to characterize specific interactions between negatively charged lipids, such as phosphatidic acid, and the purified nicotinic acetylcholine receptor from Torpedo californica. The specific interaction of phosphatidic acid with acetylcholine receptor is demonstrated by the receptor-induced perturbation of the lipid ionization state, which is monitored using Fourier transform infrared bands arising from the phosphate head group. The acetylcholine receptor shifts the pKa of phosphatidic acid molecules adjacent to the receptor to a lower value by almost 2 pH units from 8.5 to 6.6. Decreased pH also leads to changes in ion channel function and to changes in the secondary structure of the acetylcholine receptor in membranes containing ionizable phospholipids. Phospholipase D restores functional activity of acetylcholine receptor reconstituted in an unfavorable environment containing phosphatidylcholine by generating phosphatidic acid. Lipids such as phosphatidic acid may serve as allosteric effectors for membrane protein function and the lipid-protein interface could be a site for activity-dependent changes that lead to modulation of synaptic efficacy. {\textcopyright} 1993, The Biophysical Society.

In the following we review the atomically detailed picture of DHA acyl chains structure and dynamics that has emerged from computational studies of this system in our lab. A comprehensive approach, beginning with ab-initio quantum chemical studies of model compounds representing segments of DHA and ending with large scale classical molecular dynamics simulations of DHA-containing bilayers, is described with particular attention paid to contrasting the properties of DHA with those of saturated fatty acids. Connection with experiment is made primarily through comparison with Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) studies, particularly those that probe details of the chain structure and dynamics. Our computational results suggest that low torsional energy barriers, comparable to kT at physiological conditions, for the rotatable bonds in the DHA chain are the key to the differences observed between polyunsaturated and saturated acyl chains. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Cattle, pig and sheep oocytes isolated from healthy cumulus-oocyte complexes were pooled, within species, to provide samples of immature denuded oocytes with intact zona pellucida (n = 1000 per sample) for determination of fatty acid mass and composition in total lipid, constituent phospholipid and triglyceride. Acyl-containing lipid extracts, transmethylated in the presence of a reference penta-decaenoic acid (15:0), yielded fatty acid methyl esters which were analysed by gas chromatograph. Mean (+/- SEM) fatty acid content in samples of pig oocytes (161 +/- 18 micrograms per 1000 oocytes) was greater than that in cattle (63 +/- 6 micrograms; P {\textless} 0.01) and sheep oocytes (89 +/- 7 micrograms; P {\textless} 0.05). Of 24 fatty acids detected, palmitic (16:0; 25-35{\%}, w/w), stearic (18:0; 14-16{\%}) and oleic (18:1n-9; 22-26{\%}) acids were most prominent in all three species. Saturated fatty acids (mean = 45-55{\%}, w/w) were more abundant than mono- (27-34{\%}) or polyunsaturates (11-21{\%}). Fatty acids of the n-6 series, notably linoleic (18:2n-6; 5-8{\%}, w/w) and arachidonic acid (20:4n-6; 1-3{\%}), were the most abundant polyunsaturates. Phospholipid consistently accounted for a quarter of all fatty acids in the three species, but ruminant oocytes had a lower complement of polyunsaturates (14-19{\%}, w/w) in this fraction than pig oocytes (34{\%}, w/w) which, for example, had a three- to fourfold greater linoleic acid content. An estimated 74 ng of fatty acid was sequestered in the triglyceride fraction of individual pig oocytes compared with 23-25 ng in ruminant oocytes (P {\textless} 0.01). It is concluded that the greater fatty acid content of pig oocytes is primarily due to more abundant triglyceride reserves. Furthermore, this species-specific difference, and that in respect of polyunsaturated fatty acid reserves, may underlie the contrasting chilling, culture and cryopreservation sensitivities of embryos derived from pig and ruminant (cattle, sheep) oocytes.},

abstract = {Polyunsaturated lipids are an essential component of biological membranes, influencing order and dynamics of lipids, protein-lipid interaction, and membrane transport properties. To gain an atomic level picture of the impact of polyunsaturation on membrane properties, quantum mechanical (QM) and empirical force field based calculations have been undertaken. The QM calculations of the torsional energy surface for rotation about vinyl-methylene bonds reveal low barriers to rotation, indicating an intrinsic propensity toward flexibility. Based on QM and experimental data, empirical force field parameters were developed for polyunsaturated lipids and applied in a 16 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of a 1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glyerco-3-phosphocholine (SDPC) lipid bilayer. The simulation results are in good agreement with experimental data, suggesting an unusually high degree of conformational flexibility of polyunsaturated hydrocarbon chains in membranes. The detailed analysis of chain conformation and dynamics by simulations is aiding the interpretation of experimental data and is useful for understanding the unique role of polyunsaturated lipids in biological membranes. The complete force field is included as Supporting Information and is available from http://www.pharmacy.umaryland.edu/faculty/amackere/research.html.},

abstract = {The outer layers of the mammalian epidermis protect the organism from water loss and external injury. The bather as visualized with tracers has been shown to develop initially in the stratum granulosum concurrent with the intercellular deposition of extruded lamellar-body contents. This lamellar material greatly expands the intercellular compartment, and following cornification appears to form broad sheets which freeze fracture like lipids, deviating the fracture-plane from the hydrophobic interior of the membrane to the apparently more hydrophobic material in the intercellular space. Isolated upper epidermal sheets were first obtained from neonatal mice with staphylococcal exfoliatin, and then were treated with lipid solvents in order both to identify membrane structures formerly obscured by intercellular lipid and to characterize lipids contributing to barrier function. Histochemical stains were also used to localize phospholipid and neutral lipid deposits in barrier layers. After solvent treatment, the fracture plane reverted from the intercellular space to the plasma membrane, revealing sparse membrane particles low in the stratum corneum and particle-free fracture faces in mid-to-upper regions. Extracted upper epidermal sheets contained 3-4{\%} lipid, almost equally distributed between polar and nonpolar substances, with unexpectedly large quantities of glycolipid, hydrocarbons, and free fatty acids. Gas liquid chromatography demonstrated unusually large quantities of long-chain fatty acids (C24:0 and C26:0) in all polar lipid fractions and in free fatty acids. Histochemical stains demonstrated neutral lipids in stratum corneum intercellular spaces, phospholipids within granular cells, and PAS-positive material both within and between granular cells. These combined histochemical and biochemical studies confirm earlier reports demonstrating a shift from polar to neutral lipid during cornification. They also indicate that within the stratum corneum lipids are segregated in the intercellular spaces, a pattern consistent with electron microscopic images. Furthermore, they suggest that granular layer polar lipid, through as yet undefined mechanisms, may be transformed into the neutral lipids of the cornified layer. Finally, the observed admixture of lipids with long-chain, highly saturated fatty acid chains, as well as the sterols are ideally suited (and situated) to function as the epidermal permeability barrier.},

abstract = {The plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells contains several types of lipids displaying high biochemical variability in both their apolar moiety (e.g., the acyl chain of glycerolipids) and their polar head (e.g., the sugar structure of glycosphingolipids). Among these lipids, cholesterol is unique because its biochemical variability is almost exclusively restricted to the oxidation of its polar -OH group. Although generally considered the most rigid membrane lipid, cholesterol can adopt a broad range of conformations due to the flexibility of its isooctyl chain linked to the polycyclic sterane backbone. Moreover, cholesterol is an asymmetric molecule displaying a planar $\alpha$ face and a rough $\beta$ face. Overall, these structural features open up a number of possible interactions between cholesterol and membrane lipids and proteins, consistent with the prominent regulatory functions that this unique lipid exerts on membrane components. The aim of this review is to describe how cholesterol interacts with membrane lipids and proteins at the molecular/atomic scale, with special emphasis on transmembrane domains of proteins containing either the consensus cholesterol-binding motifs CRAC and CARC or a tilted peptide. Despite their broad structural diversity, all these domains bind cholesterol through common molecular mechanisms, leading to the identification of a subset of amino acid residues that are overrepresented in both linear and three-dimensional membrane cholesterol-binding sites.},

A wide array of fatty acids was found in the plasma total phospholipid similar to that found previously in red cell total phospholipid. The fatty acid composition in the plasma phospholipids of a given subject reflected that in his red cell phospholipids. Each individual phospholipid displayed a distinctive fatty acid pattern, which was generally similar to that of the corresponding phospholipid of red cells, although some marked differences in individual fatty acid levels between the corresponding phospholipids of plasma and red cells were evident.

abstract = {Proper ion channel function of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) requires the interaction of the protein with distinct lipid species present in the receptor's membrane microenvironment. Two classes of lipid binding sites present at the protein-membrane interface have been postulated: annular binding sites primarily occupied by phospholipids and non-annular binding sites mainly occupied by cholesterol [Jones {\&} McNamee (1988) Biochemistry 27, 2364-2374]. We investigated the binding of these lipids to the nAChR and potential dynamics of these interactions during events associated with signal transduction by electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR) using spin-labeled analogues of phospholipids, androstane, and stearic acid. Protein-lipid interactions were characterized in receptor-rich membranes prepared from Torpedo californica electric tissue preserving the native lipid environment of the nAChR. We found a strong preference of the receptor for the phosphatidylserine (PS) analogue as compared to the other probes. Up to 57{\%} of PS were perturbed by the membrane protein, while the fraction of motionally restricted lipid for the other analogues was on the order of 30{\%}. After removal of the extramembrane portions of the membrane-bound receptor, we observed a loss of binding sites for the spin-labeled analogue of androstane and for stearic acid, but not for phospholipids and sphingomyelin analogues. Our results demonstrate the existence of topologically distinct lipid binding sites for different lipid species. In the case of cholesterol, extramembrane portions of the receptor are involved, whereas the transmembrane segments meet the requirements for the binding of phospholipids. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the nAChR did not affect protein-lipid interactions in samples of intact nAChR. Similarly, no significant changes were observed in the presence of carbamoylcholine at concentrations that caused rapid and quantitative desensitization of the nAChR.},

abstract = {The objective of this review is to summarise the published evidence that supports the existence of amyopathic dermatomyositis (ADM) and its clinical significance including risk for rapidly progressive, fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD) and possible risk for internal malignancy. By establishing such inherent risks, we hope to establish the importance of formally recognising ADM as a subset of dermatomyositis (DM). Population-based epidemiologic studies have suggested that amyopathic DM might account for 20{\%} of the total population of dermatomyositis (DM) patients (1). Patients presenting with ADM have been reported by investigators of multiple nationalities to be at risk for rapidly progressive, potentially fatal ILD (2-5). In addition, a new autoantibody, anti-CADM-140, has been reported to be a risk factor for the development of interstitial lung disease in CADM patients (6-9). It has been argued that ADM patients may be at increased risk of developing internal malignancy compared to the general population, though its rate in comparison to classic DM (CDM) needs further study (1, 10-12). In our population, 41{\%} of CADM patients were previously classified as LE or UCTD. We conclude that ADM is a real entity that makes up a significant portion of the DM disease. It is important to formally recognise amyopathic DM as a subset of DM as it carries increased risk of ILD and possibly malignancy. Without appropriate disease classification, the opportunity for ILD and malignancy screening may be missed.},

abstract = {The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is an important therapeutic target for a wide range of pathophysiological conditions, for which rational drug designs often require receptor structures at atomic resolution. Recent proof-of-concept studies demonstrated a water-solubilization approach to structure determination of membrane proteins by NMR (Slovic et al., PNAS, 101: 1828-1833, 2004; Ma et al., PNAS, 105: 16537-42, 2008). We report here the computational design and experimental characterization of WSA, a water-soluble protein with {\~{}}83{\%} sequence identity to the transmembrane (TM) domain of the nAChR $\alpha$1 subunit. Although the design was based on a low-resolution structural template, the resulting high-resolution NMR structure agrees remarkably well with the recent crystal structure of the TM domains of the bacterial Gloeobacter violaceus pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC), demonstrating the robustness and general applicability of the approach. NMR T(2) dispersion measurements showed that the TM2 domain of the designed protein was dynamic, undergoing conformational exchange on the NMR timescale. Photoaffinity labeling with isoflurane and propofol photolabels identified a common binding site in the immediate proximity of the anesthetic binding site found in the crystal structure of the anesthetic-GLIC complex. Our results illustrate the usefulness of high-resolution NMR analyses of water-solubilized channel proteins for the discovery of potential drug binding sites.},

abstract = {Propofol, a widely used intravenous general anesthetic, acts at anesthetic concentrations as a positive allosteric modulator of $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid type A receptors and at higher concentration as an inhibitor of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Here, we characterize propofol binding sites in a muscle-type nAChR by use of a photoreactive analog of propofol, 2-isopropyl-5-[3-(trifluoromethyl)-3H-diazirin-3-yl]phenol (AziPm). Based upon radioligand binding assays, AziPm stabilized the Torpedo nAChR in the resting state, whereas propofol stabilized the desensitized state. nAChR-rich membranes were photolabeled with [(3)H]AziPm, and labeled amino acids were identified by Edman degradation. [(3)H]AziPm binds at three sites within the nAChR transmembrane domain: (i) an intrasubunit site in the $\delta$ subunit helix bundle, photolabeling in the nAChR desensitized state (+agonist) $\delta$M2-18' and two residues in $\delta$M1 ($\delta$Phe-232 and $\delta$Cys-236); (ii) in the ion channel, photolabeling in the nAChR resting, closed channel state (-agonist) amino acids in the M2 helices ($\alpha$M2-6', $\beta$M2-6' and -13', and $\delta$M2-13') that line the channel lumen (with photolabeling reduced by {\textgreater}90{\%} in the desensitized state); and (iii) at the $\gamma$-$\alpha$ interface, photolabeling $\alpha$M2-10'. Propofol enhanced [(3)H]AziPm photolabeling at $\alpha$M2-10'. Propofol inhibited [(3)H]AziPm photolabeling within the $\delta$ subunit helix bundle at lower concentrations (IC50 = 40 $\mu$m) than it inhibited ion channel photolabeling (IC50 = 125 $\mu$m). These results identify for the first time a single intrasubunit propofol binding site in the nAChR transmembrane domain and suggest that this is the functionally relevant inhibitory binding site.},

abstract = {The mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) allows passage of ions and metabolites across the mitochondrial outer membrane. Cholesterol binds mammalian VDAC, and we investigated the effects of binding to human VDAC1 with atomistic molecular dynamics simulations that totaled 1.4 $\mu$s. We docked cholesterol to specific sites on VDAC that were previously identified with NMR, and we tested the reliability of multiple docking results in each site with simulations. The most favorable binding modes were used to build a VDAC model with cholesterol occupying five unique sites, and during multiple 100 ns simulations, cholesterol stably and reproducibly remained bound to the protein. For comparison, VDAC was simulated in systems with identical components but with cholesterol initially unbound. The dynamics of loops that connect adjacent $\beta$-strands were most affected by bound cholesterol, with the averaged root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) of multiple residues altered by 20-30{\%}. Cholesterol binding also stabilized charged residues inside the channel and localized the surrounding electrostatic potentials. Despite this, ion diffusion through the channel was not significantly affected by bound cholesterol, as evidenced by multi-ion potential of mean force measurements. Although we observed modest effects of cholesterol on the open channel, our model will be particularly useful in experiments that investigate how cholesterol affects VDAC function under applied electrochemical forces and also how other ligands and proteins interact with the channel.},

abstract = {The detailed analysis of the lipid composition of immature pig oocytes represents the first such study carried out on mammalian eggs. In order to undertake a large scale lipid analysis using conventional extraction and chromatographic techniques a procedure for mass harvesting relatively large numbers of pig oocytes (200-300 oocytes/ovary) was developed. The study revealed that triacylglycerol was the major lipid component (100.71 nmol/mg protein) followed by cholesterol (32.71 nmol/mg protein). Phosphatidylcholine constituted the major phospholipid component (27.83 nmol/mg protein). Pig oocytes contained relatively low proportions of phosphatidylethanolamine (16.41{\%} total phospholipid) and relatively high proportions of lysophosphatidylcholine (4.68{\%} total phospholipid). The free fatty acid pattern was strikingly similar to the fatty acid composition of phosphatidylcholine. This observation, in conjunction with the observed high levels of lysophosphatidylcholine and the low ratio of phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine, suggests a fast rate of phospholipid turnover in the immature pig oocyte. Analysis of fatty acids esterified to the individual phospholipids and neutral lipids has shown that in all the classes examined, particularly in the neutral lipid fractions, there are high levels of the saturated fatty acid palmitic acid (16:0) and the monounsaturated fatty acid oleic acid (18:1). Triacylglycerol, free fatty acids and most of the phospholipids, particularly phosphatidylethanolamine, are considerably enriched in n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, specifically linoleic (18:2), arachidonic (20:4) and adrenic (22:4) acids. This may indicate an ability of oocytes to synthesize prostaglandins and leukotrienes. The results show that the lipid environment of the immature pig oocyte may be adapted to the highly specialized requirements of the cell, promoting growth and development with a potential role in the regulation of maturation.},

abstract = {Biological membranes are supposed to contain functional domains (lipid rafts) made up in particular of sphingomyelin and cholesterol, glycolipids, and certain proteins. It is often assumed that the application of the detergent Triton at 4°C allows the isolation of these rafts as a detergent-resistant membrane fraction. The current study aims to clarify whether and how Triton changes the domain properties. To this end, temperature-dependent transitions in vesicles of an equimolar mixture of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, egg sphingomyelin, and cholesterol were monitored at different Triton concentrations by differential scanning calorimetry and pressure perturbation calorimetry. Transitions initiated by the addition of Triton to the lipid mixture were studied by isothermal titration calorimetry, and the structure was investigated by 31P-NMR. The results are discussed in terms of liquid-disordered (ld) and -ordered (lo) bilayer and micellar (mic) phases, and the typical sequence encountered with increasing Triton content or decreasing temperature is ld, ld+lo, ld+lo+mic, and lo+mic. That means that addition of Triton may create ordered domains in a homogeneous fluid membrane, which are, in turn, Triton resistant upon subsequent membrane solubilization. Hence, detergent-resistant membranes should not be assumed to resemble biological rafts in size, structure, composition, or even existence. Functional rafts may not be steady phenomena; they might form, grow, cluster or break up, shrink, and vanish according to functional requirements, regulated by rather subtle changes in the activity of membrane disordering or ordering compounds.},

abstract = {Phase separation in biological membranes plays an important role in protein targeting and transmembrane signaling. Its occurrence in both membrane leaflets commonly gives rise to matching liquid or liquid-ordered domains in the opposing monolayers. The underlying mechanism of such co-localization is not fully understood. The decrease of the line tension around the thicker ordered domain constitutes an important driving force. Yet, robust domain coupling requires an additional energy source, which we have now identified as thermal undulations. Our theoretical analysis of elastic deformations in a lipid bilayer shows that stiffer lipid domains tend to distribute into areas with lower fluctuations of monolayer curvature. These areas naturally align in the opposing monolayers. Thus, coupling requires both membrane leafs to display a heterogeneity in splay rigidities. The heterogeneity may either originate from intrinsic lipid properties or be acquired by adsorption of peripheral molecules. Undulations and line tension act synergistically: the gain in energy due a minimized line tension is proportional to domain radius and thus primarily fuels the registration of smaller domains; whereas the energetic contribution of undulations increases with membrane area and thus primarily acts to coalesce larger domains.},

abstract = {Not all of the mysteries of life lie in our genetic code. Some can be found buried in our membranes. These shells of fat, sculpted in the central nervous system into the cellular (and subcellular) boundaries of neurons and glia, are themselves complex systems of information. The diversity of neural phospholipids, coupled with their chameleon-like capacity to transmute into bioactive molecules, provides a vast repertoire of immediate response second messengers. The effects of compositional changes on synaptic function have only begun to be appreciated. Here, we mined 29 neurolipidomic datasets for changes in neuronal membrane phospholipid metabolism in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Three overarching metabolic disturbances were detected. We found that an increase in the hydrolysis of platelet activating factor precursors and ethanolamine-containing plasmalogens, coupled with a failure to regenerate relatively rare alkyl-acyl and alkenyl-acyl structural phospholipids, correlated with disease severity. Accumulation of specific bioactive metabolites [i.e., PC(O-16:0/2:0) and PE(P-16:0/0:0)] was associated with aggravating tau pathology, enhancing vesicular release, and signaling neuronal loss. Finally, depletion of PI(16:0/20:4), PI(16:0/22:6), and PI(18:0/22:6) was implicated in accelerating A$\beta$42 biogenesis. Our analysis further suggested that converging disruptions in platelet activating factor, plasmalogen, phosphoinositol, phosphoethanolamine (PE), and docosahexaenoic acid metabolism may contribute mechanistically to catastrophic vesicular depletion, impaired receptor trafficking, and morphological dendritic deformation. Together, this analysis supports an emerging hypothesis that aberrant phospholipid metabolism may be one of multiple critical determinants required for Alzheimer disease conversion.},

abstract = {Methods used for lipid analysis in embryos and oocytes usually involve selective lipid extraction from a pool of many samples followed by chemical manipulation, separation and characterization of individual components by chromatographic techniques. Herein we report direct analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) of single and intact embryos or oocytes from various species. Biological samples were simply moisturized with the matrix solution and characteristic lipid (represented by phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins and triacylglycerols) profiles were obtained via MALDI-MS. As representative examples, human, bovine, sheep and fish oocytes, as well as bovine and insect embryos were analyzed. MALDI-MS is shown to be capable of providing characteristic lipid profiles of gametes and embryos and also to respond to modifications due to developmental stages and in vitro culture conditions of bovine embryos. Investigation in developmental biology of the biological roles of structural and reserve lipids in embryos and oocytes should therefore benefit from these rapid MALDI-MS profiles from single and intact species.},

abstract = {In recent years, our understanding of the plasma membrane has changed considerably as our knowledge of lipid microdomains has expanded. Lipid microdomains include structures known as lipid rafts and caveolae, which are readily identified by their unique lipid constituents. Cholesterol, sphingolipids and phospholipids with saturated fatty acyl chain moieties are highly enriched in these lipid microdomains. Lipid rafts and caveolae have been shown to play an important role in the compartmentalization, modulation and integration of cell signaling. Therefore, these microdomains may have an influential role in human disease. Dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) ameliorate a number of human diseases including coronary heart disease, autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, diabetes, obesity and cancer, which has been generally linked to its membrane remodeling properties. Recent in vitro evidence suggests that perturbations in membrane composition alter the function of resident proteins and, consequently, cellular responses. This review examines the role of n-3 PUFA in modulating the lipid composition and functionality of lipid microdomains and its potential significance to human health. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Liquid-crystalline phases of stacked lipid bilayers represent a pervasive motif in biomolecular assemblies. Here we report that, in addition to the usual smectic order, multicomponent multilayer membranes can exhibit columnar order arising from the coupling of two-dimensional intralayer phase separation and interlayer smectic ordering. This coupling propagates across hundreds of membrane lamellae, producing long-range alignment of phase-separated domains. Quantitative analysis of real-time dynamical experiments reveals that there is an interplay between intralayer domain growth and interlayer coupling, suggesting the existence of cooperative multilayer epitaxy. We postulate that such long-range epitaxy is solvent-assisted, and that it originates from the surface tension associated with differences in the network of hydrogen-bonded water molecules at the hydrated interfaces between the domains and the surrounding phase. Our findings might inspire the development of self-assembly-based strategies for the long-range alignment of functional lipid domains.},

To coordinate these functions, the membrane is able to laterally segregate its constituents. This capability is based on dynamic liquid-liquid immiscibility and underlies the raft concept of membrane subcompartmentalization. Lipid rafts are fluctuating nanoscale assemblies of sphingolipid, cholesterol, and proteins that can be stabilized to coalesce, forming platforms that function in membrane signaling and trafficking. Here we review the evidence for how this principle combines the potential for sphingolipid-cholesterol self-assembly with protein specificity to selectively focus membrane bioactivity.},

In the present study, the effects of various concentrations of ethanol (1-250 mM) on the lipid composition after the first 6 days of Xenopus embryo development were investigated, using an in vitro fertilization technique. Lipid analysis revealed: (1) a decrease of the cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio mainly derived from a higher content of phospholipids; (2) an increase of phospholipid unsaturated fatty acids, especially C20:4 and C20:5, with ethanol concentration of 150-250 mM; (3) a decrease of lipid-bound sialic acid with ethanol concentrations of {\textgreater} or =5 mM. These results underline that sialoglycoconjugates are a more sensitive target of alcohol in comparison with other lipid components. The cultured embryo method certainly represents a useful model for investigation of the direct effects of ethanol on lipid metabolism, excluding maternal interference which can lead to misinterpretation of data.},

abstract = {The acetylcholine receptor (AChR)-containing electroplax membranes from Torpedo californica have a relatively high cholesterol content. Reconstitution studies suggest that this cholesterol may be important in preserving or modulating the function of the acetylcholine receptor-channel complex. We have manipulated cholesterol levels in intact Torpedo AChR-rich membrane fragments using small, unilamellar phosphatidylcholine liposomes. Conditions have been established that allow further subfractionation of sucrose gradient purified Torpedo electroplax membranes into AChR-rich and ATPase-rich populations and that, at the same time, achieve cholesterol depletion without phospholipid back exchange or fusion. The incubation of membranes with excess liposomes could only achieve about a 50{\%} reduction in the molar ratio of cholesterol to phospholipid. In no case was the number of cholesterol molecules per AChR oligomer reduced below 36. The remaining cholesterol could not be depleted either by longer incubations or by multiple, sequential depletions. Cholesterol depletion was accompanied by a significant increase in bulk membrane fluidity as measured by electron spin resonance spectroscopy, but the equilibrium binding parameters of acetylcholine to its receptor were unaltered. This suggests strongly that there exist two pools of cholesterol in the AChR-rich Torpedo electroplax membrane: an easily depleted fraction that influences bulk fluidity, and a tightly-bound fraction perhaps surrounding the AChR oligomer. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

All oocytes were ranked (A or B) on the basis of their cytoplasmic quality. Fatty acid composition (mol {\%}; w/w) in the total lipid fraction was analysed by gas chromatography. Triglyceride, total cholesterol, phospholipid (phosphocholine-containing phospholipid) and non-esterified fatty acid contents of immature and in vitro matured oocytes were determined using lipid analysis kits. Phosphocholine-containing phospholipid and non-esterified fatty acid contents were determined in frozen-thawed immature bovine oocytes. Palmitic acid was the most abundant fatty acid in immature oocytes (A: 35{\%}, B: 36{\%}), and in in vitro matured oocytes cultured in the medium containing serum (A: 36{\%}, B: 35{\%}) or polyvinyl alcohol (A: 33{\%}, B: 36{\%}). Oleic acid was the second most abundant fatty acid in all A ranked oocytes, whereas stearic acid was the second most abundant fatty acid in all B ranked oocytes. There were significant differences (P {\textless} 0.05) in linoleic and arachidonic acid fractions between A and B ranked immature oocytes. In vitro matured oocytes had significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) lower proportions of linoleic and arachidonic acids, and significantly (P {\textless} 0.01) lower contents of triglyceride and total cholesterol compared with those of immature oocytes. The fatty acid composition of in vitro matured oocytes cultured in medium containing fetal calf serum or polyvinyl alcohol was similar, but significant differences (P {\textless} 0.01) in triglyceride and the total cholesterol content were observed. There was a significant decrease (P {\textless} 0.05) in the arachidonic acid proportion in frozen-thawed immature oocytes compared with that in fresh immature oocytes. In addition, significant (P {\textless} 0.05) decreases in both phospholipid (15.8--10.6 pmol) and non-esterified fatty acid (11.0--4.1 pmol) were found in frozen--thawed immature oocytes. The results indicate that lipids are available for use as an energy source for maturation and that serum lipids are incorporated into the oocyte cytoplasm during in vitro maturation. The changes in the lipid content (mainly phospholipid) and fatty acid composition were also observed in frozen--thawed immature oocytes. The study indicates that the alteration of fatty acid composition in bovine oocytes might improve maturation and cryopreservation.},

abstract = {Membranes are central for cells as borders to the environment or intracellular organelle definition. They are composed of and harbor different molecules like various lipid species and sterols, and they are generally crowded with proteins. The membrane system is very dynamic and components show lateral, rotational and translational diffusion. The consequence of the latter is that phase separation can occur in membranes in vivo and in vitro. It was documented that molecular dynamics simulations of an idealized plasma membrane model result in formation of membrane areas where either saturated lipids and cholesterol (liquid-ordered character, Lo) or unsaturated lipids (liquid-disordered character, Ld) were enriched. Furthermore, current discussions favor the idea that proteins are sorted into the liquid-disordered phase of model membranes, but experimental support for the behavior of isolated proteins in native membranes is sparse. To gain insight into the protein behavior we built a model of the red blood cell membrane with integrated glycophorin A dimer. The sorting and the dynamics of the dimer were subsequently explored by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. In addition, we inspected the impact of lipid head groups and the presence of cholesterol within the membrane on the dynamics of the dimer within the membrane. We observed that cholesterol is important for the formation of membrane areas with Lo and Ld character. Moreover, it is an important factor for the reproduction of the dynamic behavior of the protein found in its native environment. The protein dimer was exclusively sorted into the domain of Ld character in the model red blood cell plasma membrane. Therefore, we present structural information on the glycophorin A dimer distribution in the plasma membrane in the absence of other factors like e.g. lipid anchors in a coarse grain resolution.},

abstract = {The influence of the local anesthetics tetracaine (TTC) and procaine (PRC) on bilayers of specifically deuterated phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) has been studied by 2H and 31P NMR. Dimyristoylphosphatidylethanolamines (DMPE), deuterated at positions 2, 4, and 14 of the sn-2 chain, position 2 of the sn-1 chain, and in the ethanolamine headgroup, were mixed 1:1 with a semisynthetic egg PE and the effect of measured quantities of TTC and PRC on the 2H quadrupole splittings, spin-lattice relaxation times, and 31P chemical shift anisotropy were observed. Experiments were performed at pH 5.5, when the anesthetics are primarily charged, and at pH 9.5, when they are uncharged. Tetracaine was observed to disorder the hydrocarbon region of the bilayer and to induce a conformational change in the PE headgroup. Conversely, procaine had little or no effect on the hydrocarbon region and induced only a small change in the headgroup. These conformational changes and disordering effects, when adjusted for anesthetic partitioning, are essentially independent of the charge on the anesthetic. However, at pH 5.5 and low TTC/PE molar ratios (less than 0.1), the 2H NMR spectra showed two lipid environments--one corresponding to free PE and the other to PE in contact with TTC. Continued addition of TTC resulted in the eventual disappearance of the free PE signal and the corresponding growth of the signal from PE in contact with TTC. At pH 9.5, when TTC is uncharged, only one signal is observed. This indicates that at low pH, when TTC is primarily charged, it has a much slower rate of lateral diffusion in the PE bilayer. In mixtures of PE and phosphatidylserine, a conformational change in the headgroup was noted which was similar to that seen in the pure PE; however, there was no evidence for slow lateral diffusion of the anesthetics. The effects of TTC and PRC on the PE bilayer, when combined with our earlier study of the labeled anesthetics [Kelusky, E.C., and I.C.P. Smith, Biochemistry, 22:6011-6017 (1983)], indicate that TTC penetrates into the hydrocarbon portion of the bilayer whereas PRC sites only in the headgroup region.},

abstract = {Lipid rafts are nanoscopic assemblies of sphingolipids, cholesterol, and specific membrane proteins that contribute to lateral heterogeneity in eukaryotic membranes. Separation of artificial membranes into liquid-ordered (Lo) and liquid-disordered phases is regarded as a common model for this compartmentalization. However, tight lipid packing in Lo phases seems to conflict with efficient partitioning of raft-associated transmembrane (TM) proteins. To assess membrane order as a component of raft organization, we performed fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy with the membrane probes Laurdan and C-laurdan. First, we assessed lipid packing in model membranes of various compositions and found cholesterol and acyl chain dependence of membrane order. Then we probed cell membranes by using two novel systems that exhibit inducible phase separation: giant plasma membrane vesicles [Baumgart et al. (2007) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 104:3165-3170] and plasma membrane spheres. Notably, only the latter support selective inclusion of raft TM proteins with the ganglioside GM1 into one phase. We measured comparable small differences in order between the separated phases of both biomembranes. Lateral packing in the ordered phase of giant plasma membrane vesicles resembled the Lo domain of model membranes, whereas the GM1 phase in plasma membrane spheres exhibited considerably lower order, consistent with different partitioning of lipid and TM protein markers. Thus, lipid-mediated coalescence of the GM1 raft domain seems to be distinct from the formation of a Lo phase, suggesting additional interactions between proteins and lipids to be effective.},

Here, we use a photoreactive analog of propofol (2-isopropyl-5-[3-(trifluoromethyl)-3H-diazirin-3-yl]phenol ([(3)H]AziPm)) to identify propofol-binding sites in heterologously expressed human $\alpha$1$\beta$3 GABAARs. Propofol, AziPm, etomidate, and R-mTFD-MPAB each inhibited [(3)H]AziPm photoincorporation into GABAAR subunits maximally by ∼ 50{\%}. When the amino acids photolabeled by [(3)H]AziPm were identified by protein microsequencing, we found propofol-inhibitable photolabeling of amino acids in the $\beta$3-$\alpha$1 subunit interface ($\beta$3Met-286 in $\beta$3M3 and $\alpha$1Met-236 in $\alpha$1M1), previously photolabeled by [(3)H]azietomidate, and $\alpha$1Ile-239, located one helical turn below $\alpha$1Met-236. There was also propofol-inhibitable [(3)H]AziPm photolabeling of $\beta$3Met-227 in $\beta$M1, the amino acid in the $\alpha$1-$\beta$3 subunit interface photolabeled by R-[(3)H]mTFD-MPAB. The propofol-inhibitable [(3)H]AziPm photolabeling in the GABAAR $\beta$3 subunit in conjunction with the concentration dependence of inhibition of that photolabeling by etomidate or R-mTFD-MPAB also establish that each anesthetic binds to the homologous site at the $\beta$3-$\beta$3 subunit interface. These results establish that AziPm as well as propofol bind to the homologous intersubunit sites in the GABAAR transmembrane domain that binds etomidate or R-mTFD-MPAB with high affinity.},

abstract = {Phospholipid bilayers have been intensively studied by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation in recent years. The properties of bilayer edges are important in determining the structure and stability of pores formed in vesicles and biomembranes. In this work, we use molecular dynamics simulation to investigate the structure, dynamics, and line tension of the edges of bilayer ribbons composed of pure dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) or palmitoyl-oleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (POPE). As expected, we observe a significant reorganization of lipids at and near the edges. The treatment of electrostatic effects is shown to have a qualitative impact on the structure and stability of the edge, and significant differences are observed in the dynamics and structure of edges formed by DMPC and palmitoyl-oleoylphosphatidylethanolamine. From the pressure anisotropy in the simulation box, we calculate a line tension of approximately 10-30 pN for the DMPC edge, in qualitative agreement with experimental estimates for similar lipids.},

abstract = {Lipid rafts are subdomains of the plasma membrane that contain high concentrations of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids. They exist as distinct liquid-ordered regions of the membrane that are resistant to extraction with nonionic detergents. Rafts appear to be small in size, but may constitute a relatively large fraction of the plasma membrane. While rafts have a distinctive protein and lipid composition, all rafts do not appear to be identical in terms of either the proteins or the lipids that they contain. A variety of proteins, especially those involved in cell signaling, have been shown to partition into lipid rafts. As a result, lipid rafts are thought to be involved in the regulation of signal transduction. Experimental evidence suggests that there are probably several different mechanisms through which rafts control cell signaling. For example, rafts may contain incomplete signaling pathways that are activated when a receptor or other required molecule is recruited into the raft. Rafts may also be important in limiting signaling, either by physical sequestration of signaling components to block nonspecific interactions, or by suppressing the intrinsic activity of signaling proteins present within rafts.This review provides an overview of the physical characteristics of lipid rafts and summarizes studies that have helped to elucidate the role of lipid rafts in signaling via receptor tyrosine kinases and G protein-coupled receptors.},

abstract = {In order to investigate experimentally inaccessible, molecular-level detail regarding interleaflet interaction in membranes, we have run an extensive series of coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of phase separated lipid bilayers. The simulations are motivated by differences in lipid and cholesterol composition in the inner and outer leaflets of biological membranes. Over the past several years, this phenomenon has inspired a series of experiments in model membrane systems which have explored the effects of lipid compositional asymmetry in the two leaflets. The simulations are directed at understanding one potential consequence of compositional asymmetry, that being regions of bilayers where liquid-ordered (Lo) domains in one leaflet are opposite liquid-disordered (Ld) domains in the other leaflet (phase asymmetry). The simulated bilayers are of two sorts: 1) Compositionally symmetric leaflets where each of the two leaflets contains an identical, phase separated (Lo/Ld) mixture of cholesterol, saturated and unsaturated phospholipid; and 2) Compositionally asymmetric leaflets, where one leaflet contains a phase separated (Lo/Ld) mixture while the other contains only unsaturated lipid, which on its own would be in the Ld phase. In addition, we have run simulations where the lengths of the saturated lipid chains as well as the mole ratios of the three lipid components are varied. Collectively, we report on three types of interleaflet coupling within a bilayer. First, we show the effects of compositional asymmetry on acyl chain tilt and order, lipid rotational dynamics, and lateral diffusion in regions of leaflets that are opposite Lo domains. Second, we show substantial effects of compositional asymmetry on local bilayer curvature, with the conclusion that phase separated leaflets resist curvature, while inducing large degrees of curvature in an opposing Ld leaflet. Finally, in compositionally symmetric, phase separated bilayers, we find phase asymmetry (domain antiregistration) between the two leaflets occurs as a consequence of mismatched acyl chain-lengths in the saturated and unsaturated lipids.},

AChR distribution was evaluated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer efficiency between the AChR intrinsic fluorescence and Laurdan or dehydroergosterol fluorescence, and by analyzing the distribution of AChR in detergent-resistant and detergent-soluble fractions (1{\%} Triton X-100, 4 °C). bSM-induced transbilayer asymmetry or the presence of 16:0-SM and/or 18:0-SM (unlike bSM or 24:1-SM) resulted in the preferential partitioning of AChR in Lo domains, suggesting that the localization of AChR in ordered domains strongly depends on the characteristics of the host lipid membrane, and in particular on the sphingolipid composition and transbilayer asymmetry.},

Evidence supporting this hypothesis for schizophrenia includes abnormal brain phospholipid turnover shown by 31P Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, increased levels of phospholipase A2, reduced niacin skin flush response, abnormal electroretinogram, and reduced cell membrane levels of n-3 and n-6 PUFA. In depression, there is strong epidemiological evidence that fish consumption reduces risk of becoming depressed and evidence that cell membrane levels of n-3 PUFA are reduced. Four out of five placebo-controlled double- blind trials of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in the treatment of schizophrenia have given positive findings. In depression, two placebo-controlled trials have shown a strong therapeutic effect of ethyl-EPA added to existing medication. The mode of action of EPA is currently not known, but recent evidence suggests that arachidonic acid (AA) if of particular importance in schizophrenia and that clinical improvement in schizophrenic patients using EPA treatment correlates with changes in AA. {\textcopyright} 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

The aim of the study was to assess PUFA consumption and confirm whether dietary habits are related to the risk of transition to full-threshold psychosis in HR individuals during a 12-month follow-up. PUFA consumption during the previous year was analyzed in 62 h individuals and 33 healthy controls (HC) at the beginning of the follow-up period using a validated Food-Frequency Questionnaire and the Polish Food Composition Tables. Fifteen HR individuals converted into psychosis (C-HR) during the 12-month follow-up. C-HR individuals reported significantly higher consumption of n-6 fatty acids (linoleic acid, LA and arachidonic acid, AA) in comparison with individuals who did not develop psychosis (NC-HR). The C-HR group reported a significantly higher AA/(EPA+DHA) consumption ratio than the NC-HR group. HC reported significantly higher consumption of most n-3 PUFA and lower consumption of all n-6 PUFA than both groups of HR individuals. The results suggest that dietary patterns of PUFA consumption may play a role in the conversion to psychosis of HR individuals.},

Particularly striking is the result that up to 40{\%} cholesterol does not increase the bending modulus K(C) of membranes composed of phosphatidylcholine lipids with two cis monounsaturated chains, although it does have the expected stiffening effect on membranes composed of lipids with two saturated chains. The B fluctuational modulus in the smectic liquid crystal theory is obtained and used to discuss the interactions between bilayers. Our K(C) results motivate a theory of elastic moduli in the high cholesterol limit and they challenge the relevance of universality concepts. Although most of our results were obtained at 30 degrees C , additional data at other temperatures to allow consideration of a reduced temperature variable do not support universality for the effect of cholesterol on all lipid bilayers. If the concept of universality is to be valid, different numbers of saturated chains must be considered to create different universality classes. The above experimental results were obtained from analysis of x-ray scattering in the low angle and wide angle regions.},

abstract = {Zebrafish (Danio rerio) have been used to study multiple effects of nicotine, for example on cognition, locomotion, and stress responses, relying on the assumption that pharmacological tools will operate similarly upon molecular substrates in the fish and mammalian systems. We have cloned the zebrafish nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits and expressed key nAChR subtypes in Xenopus oocytes including neuronal ($\alpha$4$\beta$2, $\alpha$2$\beta$2, $\alpha$3$\beta$4, and $\alpha$7) and muscle ($\alpha$1$\beta$1b$\epsilon$$\delta$) nAChR. Consistent with studies of mammalian nAChR, nicotine was relatively inactive on muscle-type receptors, having both low potency and efficacy. It had high efficacy but low potency for $\alpha$7 receptors, and the best potency and good efficacy for $\alpha$4$\beta$2 receptors. Cytisine, a key lead compound for the development of smoking cessation agents, is a full agonist for both mammalian $\alpha$7 and $\alpha$3$\beta$4 receptors, but a full agonist only for the fish $\alpha$7, with surprisingly low efficacy for $\alpha$3$\beta$4. The efficacy of cytisine for $\alpha$4$\beta$2 was somewhat greater than typically reported for mammalian $\alpha$4$\beta$2. The ganglionic blocker mecamylamine was most potent for blocking $\alpha$3$\beta$4 receptors, least potent for $\alpha$7, and roughly equipotent for the muscle receptors and the $\beta$2-containing nAChR. However, the block of $\beta$2-containing receptors was slowly reversible, consistent with effective targeting of these CNS-type receptors in vivo. Three prototypical $\alpha$7-selective agonists, choline, tropane, and 4OH-GTS-21, were tested, and these agents were observed to activate both fish $\alpha$7 and $\alpha$4$\beta$2 nAChR. Our data therefore indicate that while some pharmacological tools used in zebrafish may function as expected, others will not. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are ligand gated ion channels that mediate fast chemical neurotransmission at the neuromuscular junction and play diverse signaling roles in the central nervous system. The nicotinic receptor has been a model system for cell surface receptors, and specifically for ligand-gated ion channels, for well over a century1,2. In addition to the receptors' prominent roles in the development of the fields of pharmacology and neurobiology, nicotinic receptors are important therapeutic targets for neuromuscular disease, addiction, epilepsy, and for neuromuscular blocking agents used during surgery2–4. The overall architecture of the receptor was described in landmark studies of the nicotinic receptor isolated from the electric organ of T 5. Structures of a soluble ligand binding domain have provided atomic-scale insights into receptor-ligand interactions6, while high-resolution structures of other members of the pentameric receptor superfamily provide touchstones for an emerging allosteric gating mechanism7. All available high-resolution structures are of homopentameric receptors. However, orpedo marmorata the vast majority of pentameric receptors (called Cys-loop receptors in eukaryotes) present physiologically are heteromeric. Here we present the X-ray crystallographic structure of the human $\alpha$4$\beta$2 nicotinic receptor, the most abundant nicotinic subtype in the brain. This structure provides insights into the architectural principles governing ligand recognition, heteromer assembly, ion permeation and desensitization in this prototypical receptor class.},

It is demonstrated that many complex shape transitions of cell membranes can be mimicked by single lipid bilayer vesicles by simply varying the area-to-volume ratio or by chemically induced bending moments suggesting that these processes are governed by the universal minimum bending energy concept of closed shells composed of stratified membranes. The essential role of the coupling between curvature and phase separation in mixed membranes for the formation and stabilization of local pits and buds or the fission of budded vesicles is demonstrated.

abstract = {We have examined the effects of cholesterol on the thermotropic phase behavior and organization of aqueous dispersions of a homologous series of linear disaturated phosphatidylserines by high-sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. We find that the incorporation of increasing quantities of cholesterol progressively reduces the temperature, enthalpy, and cooperativity of the gel-to-liquid-crystalline phase transition of the host phosphatidylserine bilayer, such that a cooperative chain-melting phase transition is completely or almost completely abolished at 50 mol {\%} cholesterol, in contrast to the results of previous studies. We are also unable to detect the presence of a separate anhydrous cholesterol or cholesterol monohydrate phase in our binary mixtures, again in contrast to previous reports. We further show that the magnitude of the reduction in the phase transition temperature induced by cholesterol addition is independent of the hydrocarbon chain length of the phosphatidylserine studied. This result contrasts with our previous results with phosphatidylcholine bilayers, where we found that cholesterol increases or decreases the phase transition temperature in a chain length-dependent manner (1993. Biochemistry, 32:516-522), but is in agreement with our previous results for phosphatidylethanolamine bilayers, where no hydrocarbon chain length-dependent effects were observed (1999. Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1416.119-234). However, the reduction in the phase transition temperature by cholesterol is of greater magnitude in phosphatidylethanolamine as compared to phosphatidylserine bilayers. We also show that the addition of cholesterol facilitates the formation of the lamellar crystalline phase in phosphatidylserine bilayers, as it does in phosphatidylethanolamine bilayers, whereas the formation of such phases in phosphatidylcholine bilayers is inhibited by the presence of cholesterol. We ascribe the limited miscibility of cholesterol in phosphatidylserine bilayers reported previously to a fractional crystallization of the cholesterol and phospholipid phases during the removal of organic solvent from the binary mixture before the hydration of the sample. In general, the results of our studies to date indicate that the magnitude of the effect of cholesterol on the thermotropic phase behavior of the host phospholipid bilayer, and its miscibility in phospholipid dispersions generally, depend on the strength of the attractive interactions between the polar headgroups and the hydrocarbon chains of the phospholipid molecule, and not on the charge of the polar headgroups per se},

abstract = {Several small drugs and medicinal plant extracts, such as the Indian spice extract curcumin, have a wide range of useful pharmacological properties that cannot be ascribed to binding to a single protein target alone. The lipid bilayer membrane is thought to mediate the effects of many such molecules directly via perturbation of the plasma membrane structure and dynamics, or indirectly by modulating transmembrane protein conformational equilibria. Furthermore, for bioavailability, drugs must interact with and eventually permeate the lipid bilayer barrier on the surface of cells. Biophysical studies of the interactions of drugs and plant extracts are therefore of interest. Molecular dynamics simulations, which can access time and length scales that are not simultaneously accessible by other experimental methods, are often used to obtain quantitative molecular and thermodynamic descriptions of these interactions, often with complementary biophysical measurements. This review considers recent molecular dynamics simulations of small drug-like molecules with membranes, and provides a biophysical description of possible routes of membrane-mediated pharmacological effects of drugs. The review is not exhaustive, and we focus on molecules containing aromatic ring-like structures to develop our hypotheses. We also show that some drugs and anesthetics may have an effect on the lipid bilayer analogous to that of cholesterol.},

In contrast, allosteric equilibria were strongly shifted towards the desensitized state in CHAPS.

abstract = {SUMMARY The lipid composition of highly purified synaptosomal plasma membranes has been analyzed. The membranes contained cholesterol (0.158 mg per mg protein), phospholipids (0.714 mg per mg protein) and gangliosides (0.125 mg per mg protein) as major constituents while cerebrosides and sulphatides were present in only trace amounts. Analysis of the gangliosides by thin-layer chromatography showed that there was no selective enrichment of any individual type in the plasma membranes in relation to total brain. The major phospholipids were ethanolamine (34.2 {\%}), choline (41.6 {\%}) and serine (13.2 {\%}) phosphoglycerides. Inositol monophospho-glyceride (3.5 {\%}), sphingomyelin (5.1 {\%}) and lysolecithin (1.0 {\%}) were relatively minor components while phosphatidylglycerol was not present. Each phospholipid class showed a specific fatty acid composition which differed from that of the other phospholipids. This result extends the specific fatty acid compositions observed in grey matter and certain sub-fractions by other workers. In particular, choline phos-phoglycerides contained high levels of saturated fatty acids while large quantities of docosahexaenoic acid were present in ethanolamine and serine phosphoglycerides.},

The effects of n-3 PUFA are pleiotropic and multifaceted, resulting in an incomplete understanding of their molecular mechanisms of action. Here, we focus on a highly conserved mechanism of n-3 PUFA, which is the alteration of the organization of the plasma membrane. We highlight recent work demonstrating that enrichment of n-3 PUFA in the plasma membrane alters the lateral organization of membrane signaling assemblies (i.e. lipid rafts). This mechanism is central for n-3 PUFA regulation of downstream signaling, T-cell activation, transcriptional activation, and cytokine secretion. We conclude that these studies provide strong evidence for a predominant mechanism by which n-3 PUFA function in colon cancer prevention. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Tillman2003,
abstract = {Biologic membranes are not simply inert physical barriers, but complex and dynamic environments that affect membrane protein structure and function. Residing within these environments, ion channels control the flux of ions across the membrane through conformational changes that allow transient ion flux through a central pore. These conformational changes may be modulated by changes in transmembrane electrochemical potential, the binding of small ligands or other proteins, or changes in the local lipid environment. Ion channels play fundamental roles in cellular function and, in higher eukaryotes, are the primary means of intercellular signaling, especially between excitable cells such as neurons. The focus of this review is to examine how the composition of the bilayer affects ion channel structure and function. This is an important consideration because the bilayer composition varies greatly in different cell types and in different organellar membranes. Even within a membrane, the lipid composition differs between the inner and outer leaflets, and the composition within a given leaflet is both heterogeneous and highly dynamic. Differential packing of lipids (and proteins) leads to the formation of microdomains, and lateral diffusion of these microdomains or "lipid rafts" serve as mobile platforms for the clustering and organization of bilayer constituents including ion channels. The structure and function of these channels are sensitive to specific chemical interactions with neighboring components of the membrane and also to the biophysical properties of their membrane microenvironment (e.g., fluidity, lateral pressure profile, and bilayer thickness). As specific examples, we have focused on the K+ ion channels and the ligand-gated nicotinicoid receptors, two classes of ion channels that have been well-characterized structurally and functionally. The responsiveness of these ion channels to changes in the lipid environment illustrate how ion channels, and more generally, any membrane protein, may be regulated via cellular control of membrane composition.},

abstract = {We studied compositionally heterogeneous multi-component model membranes comprised of saturated lipids, unsaturated lipids, cholesterol, and $\alpha$-helical TM protein models using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. Reducing the mismatch between the length of the saturated and unsaturated lipid tails reduced the driving force for segregation into liquid-ordered (lo) and liquid-disordered (ld) lipid domains. Cholesterol depletion had a similar effect, and binary lipid mixtures without cholesterol did not undergo large-scale phase separation under the simulation conditions. The phase-separating ternary dipalmitoyl- phosphatidylcholine (DPPC)/dilinoleoyl-PC (DLiPC)/cholesterol bilayer was found to segregate into lo and ld domains also in the presence of a high concentration of ΤΜ helices. The ld domain was highly crowded with TM helices (protein-to-lipid ratio {\~{}} 1:5), slowing down lateral diffusion by a factor of 5-10 as compared to the dilute case, with anomalous (sub)-diffusion on the $\mu$s time scale. The membrane with the less strongly unsaturated palmitoyl-linoleoyl-PC instead of DLiPC, which in the absence of TM $\alpha$-helices less strongly deviated from ideal mixing, could be brought closer to a miscibility critical point by introducing a high concentration of TM helices. Finally, the 7-TM protein bacteriorhodopsin was found to partition into the ld domains irrespective of hydrophobic matching. These results show that it is possible to directly study the lateral reorganization of lipids and proteins in compositionally heterogeneous and crowded model biomembranes with coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, a step toward simulations of realistic, compositionally complex cellular membranes. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Most methods used for their molecular analysis require elaborate sample preparation including separate protocols for the water soluble and lipid components. In this study, laser ablation electrospray ionization (LAESI), an ambient ionization technique, was used for direct mass spectrometric analysis of X. laevis eggs and early stage embryos up to five cleavage cycles. Single unfertilized and fertilized eggs, their animal and vegetal poles, and embryos through the 32-cell stage were analyzed. Fifty two small metabolite ions, including glutathione, GABA and amino acids, as well as numerous lipids including 14 fatty acids, 13 lysophosphatidylcholines, 36 phosphatidylcholines and 29 triacylglycerols were putatively identified. Additionally, some proteins, for example thymosin beta4 (Xen), were also detected. On the subcellular level, the lipid profiles were found to differ between the animal and vegetal poles of the eggs. Radial profiling revealed profound compositional differences between the jelly coat vitelline/plasma membrane and egg cytoplasm. Changes in the metabolic profile of the egg following fertilization, e.g., the decline of polyamine content with the development of the embryo were observed using LAESI-MS. This approach enables the exploration of metabolic and lipid changes during the early stages of embryogenesis.},

abstract = {Analogues of dimyristoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DMPE) have been prepared with head groups modified by N-alkylation, alkylation of carbon 2 of the ethanolamine group, or interposition of extra methylene segments between the phosphoryl and amino groups. The phases formed by these lipids in aqueous dispersions have been examined by high-sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry and Raman spectroscopy. All of the DMPE analogues examined, excepting N-methyl-DMPE but including N-ethyl-DMPE, form hydrated gel phases that are metastable with respect to a dehydrated "high-melting" solid phase that has been observed previously for DMPE itself. The properties and the conditions of formation of this high-melting phase are qualitatively distinct from those of the "subgel" phase, which is observed for dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and for some of the DMPE analogues examined in this study. The high-melting phases of different DMPE analogues all exhibit similarly tight packing of the acyl chains, which however do not pack according to a single type of subcell that can be universally and specifically associated with this phase. Increasing the size of the PE head group invariably decreases the melting temperature of the hydrated gel phase, even when the normal hydrogen-bonding capability of the head group is preserved. By contrast, addition of larger alkyl substituents to either the amino group or carbon 2 of the ethanolamine moiety substantially increases the transition temperature of the high-melting solid phase, indicating that the contributions of the head group to the energies of the hydrated gel and the high-melting phases are fundamentally different. Our results suggest that the head group structural requirements for a neutral phospholipid to form stable hydrated bilayers are rather stringent, a fact that may explain the overwhelming predominance of only a few such head group structures in most natural membranes.},

Here we further tested for differences in the molecular interactions of an oleic (OA) versus DHA-containing phospholipid with sphingomyelin (SM) and cholesterol (CHOL) utilizing (2)H NMR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, atomic force microscopy, and detergent extractions in model bilayer membranes. (2)H NMR and DSC (differential scanning calorimetry) established the phase behavior of the OA-containing 1-[(2)H(31)]palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (16:0-18:1PE-d(31))/SM (1:1) and the DHA-containing 1-[(2)H(31)]palmitoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (16:0-22:6PE-d(31))/SM (1:1) in the absence and presence of equimolar CHOL. CHOL was observed to affect the OA-containing phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) more than the DHA-containing PE, as exemplified by {\textgreater}2 x greater increase in order measured for the perdeuterated palmitic chain in 16:0-18:1PE-d(31)/SM (1:1) compared to 16:0-22:6PE-d(31)/SM (1:1) bilayers in the liquid crystalline phase. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments showed less lateral phase separation between 16:0-18:1PE-rich and SM/CHOL-rich raft domains in 16:0-18:1PE/SM/CHOL (1:1:1) bilayers than was observed when 16:0-22:6PE replaced 16:0-18:1PE. Differences in the molecular interaction of 16:0-18:1PE and 16:0-22:6PE with SM/CHOL were also found using biochemical detergent extractions. In the presence of equimolar SM/CHOL, 16:0-18:1PE showed decreased solubilization in comparison to 16:0-22:6PE, indicating greater phase separation with the DHA-PE. Detergent experiments were also conducted with cardiomyocytes fed radiolabeled OA or DHA. Although both OA and DHA were found to be largely detergent solubilized, the amount of OA that was found to be associated with raft-rich detergent-resistant membranes exceeded DHA by almost a factor of 2. We conclude that the OA-PE phase separates from rafts far less than DHA-PE, which may have implications for cellular signaling.},

Segregated lipid domains of increased local order, referred to as rafts, are believed to be prominent features in eukaryotic plasma membranes; however, their exact nature (i.e. size, lifetime, composition, homogeneity) in live cells remains difficult to define. Here we present evidence that both synthetic and natural plasma membranes assume a wide range of lipid packing states with varying levels of molecular order. These states may be adapted and specifically tuned by cells during active cellular processes, as we show for stimulated insulin secretion. Most importantly, these states regulate both the partitioning of molecules between coexisting domains and the bioactivity of their constituent molecules, which we demonstrate for the ligand binding activity of the glycosphingolipid receptor GM1. These results confirm the complexity and flexibility of lipid-mediated membrane organization and reveal mechanisms by which this flexibility could be functionalized by cells.},

abstract = {Micropipette pressurization of giant bilayer vesicles was used to measure both elastic bending k(c) and area stretch K(A) moduli of fluid-phase phosphatidylcholine (PC) membranes. Twelve diacyl PCs were chosen: eight with two 18 carbon chains and degrees of unsaturation from one double bond (C18:1/0, C18:0/1) to six double bonds per lipid (diC18:3), two with short saturated carbon chains (diC13:0, diC14:0), and two with long unsaturated carbon chains (diC20:4, diC22:1). Bending moduli were derived from measurements of apparent expansion in vesicle surface area under very low tensions (0.001-0.5 mN/m), which is dominated by smoothing of thermal bending undulations. Area stretch moduli were obtained from measurements of vesicle surface expansion under high tensions ({\textgreater}0.5 mN/m), which involve an increase in area per molecule and a small - but important - contribution from smoothing of residual thermal undulations. The direct stretch moduli varied little ({\textless} ± 10{\%}) with either chain unsaturation or length about a mean of 243 mN/m. On the other hand, the bending moduli of saturated/monounsaturated chain PCs increased progressively with chain length from 0.56 x 10-19 J for diC13:0 to 1.2 x 10-19 J for diC22:1. However, quite unexpectedly for longer chains, the bending moduli dropped precipitously to {\~{}}0.4 x 10-19 J when two or more cis double bonds were present in a chain (C18:0/2, diC18:2, diC18:3, diC20:4). Given nearly constant area stretch moduli, the variations in bending rigidity with chain length and polyunsaturation implied significant variations in thickness. To test this hypothesis, peak-to-peak headgroup thicknesses h(pp) of bilayers were obtained from x-ray diffraction of multibilayer arrays at controlled relative humidities. For saturated/monounsaturated chain bilayers, the distances h(pp) increased smoothly from diC13:0 to diC22:1 as expected. Moreover, the distances and elastic properties correlated well with a polymer brush model of the bilayer that specifies that the elastic ratio (k(c)/K(A))(1/2) = (h(pp) - h(o))/24, where h(o) ≃ 1 nm accounts for separation of the headgroup peaks from the deformable hydrocarbon region. However, the elastic ratios and thicknesses for diC18:2, diC18:3, and diC20:4 fell into a distinct group below the correlation, which showed that poly-cis unsaturated chain bilayers are thinner and more flexible than saturated/monounsaturated chain bilayers.},

Such a multicomponent mixture exhibits a complex phase behavior with regions of structural and compositional heterogeneity. Especially domains formed in ternary mixtures, composed of saturated and unsaturated lipids together with cholesterol, have received a lot of attention as they may resemble raft formation in real cells. Here we apply a simulation model to assess the molecular nature of these domains at the nanoscale, information that has thus far eluded experimental determination. We are able to show the spontaneous separation of a saturated phosphatidylcholine (PC)/unsaturated PC/cholesterol mixture into a liquid-ordered and a liquid-disordered phase with structural and dynamic properties closely matching experimental data. The near-atomic resolution of the simulations reveals remarkable features of both domains and the boundary domain interface. Furthermore, we predict the existence of a small surface tension between the monolayer leaflets that drives registration of the domains. At the level of molecular detail, raft-like lipid mixtures show a surprising face with possible implications for many cell membrane processes.},

abstract = {The compound 2,6-diisopropylphenol (Propofol, PRF) is widely used for inducing general anesthesia, but the mechanism of PRF action remains relatively poorly understood at the molecular level. This work examines the possibility that a potential mode of action of PRF is to modulate the lipid order in target membranes. The effect on monolayers and bilayers of dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3- phosphorylcholine (DPPC) was probed using Langmuir monolayer isotherms, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Increasing amounts of PRF in a DPPC monolayer causes a decrease in isothermal compressibility modulus at the phase transition. A partition constant for PRF in DPPC liposomes on the order of K ??? 1500 M-1 was found, and the partitioning was found to be enthalpy-driven above the melting temperature (Tm). A decrease in Tm with PRF content was found whereas the bilayer melting enthalpy ??Hm remains almost constant. The last finding indicates that PRF incorporates into the membrane at a depth near the phosphatidylcholine headgroup, in agreement with our MD-simulations. The simulations also reveal that PRF partitions into the membrane on a timescale of 0.5 ??s and has a cholesterol-like ordering effect on DPPC in the fluid phase. The vertical location of the PRF binding site in a bacterial ligand-gated ion channel coincides with the location found in our MD-simulations. Our results suggest that multiple physicochemical mechanisms may determine anesthetic potency of PRF, including effects on proteins that are mediated through the bilayer. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {This study compares the lipid composition, including individual phospholipid molecular species of solubilized nAChR detergent complexes (nAChR-DCs) with those of the bulk lipids from their source, Torpedo californica (Tc) electric tissue. This lipidomic analysis revealed seventy-seven (77) phospholipid species in the Tc tissue. Analysis of affinity-purified nAChR-DCs prepared with C-12 to C-16 phospholipid analog detergents alkylphosphocholine (FC) and lysofoscholine (LFC) demonstrated that nAChR-DCs prepared with FC12, LFC14, and LFC16 contained {\textgreater}60 phospholipids/nAChR, which was more than twice of those prepared with FC14, FC16, and LFC12. Significantly, all the nAChR-DCs lacked ethanolamine and anionic phospholipids, contained only four cholesterol molecules, and a limited number of phospholipid molecular species per nAChR. Upon incorporation into oocytes, FC12 produce significant functionality, whereas LFC14 and LFC16 nAChR-DCs displayed an increased functionality as compared to the crude Tc membrane. All three nAChR-DCs displayed different degrees of alterations in macroscopic activation and desensitization kinetics. The manner by which detergents affect lipid composition, functionality and stability of solubilized membrane proteins is a poorly understood aspect of the structural biology of membrane proteins. The nicotinic acetylcho-line receptor (nAChR) is a model transmembrane protein that has been widely used for the study of lipid-protein interactions.

abstract = {The scaffolding protein at the neuromuscular junction, rapsyn, enables clustering of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in high concentration and is critical for muscle function. Patients with insufficient receptor clustering suffer from muscle weakness. However, the detailed organization of the receptor–rapsyn net-work is poorly understood: it is unclear whether rapsyn first forms a wide meshwork to which receptors can subsequently dock or whether it only forms short bridges linking receptors together to make a large cluster. Furthermore, the number of rapsyn-binding sites per receptor (a heteropentamer) has been controversial. Here, we show by cryoelectron tomography and subtomogram averaging of Torpedo postsynaptic membrane that receptors are connected by up to three rapsyn bridges, the minimum number required to form a 2D network. Half of the receptors belong to rapsyn-connected groups comprising between two and fourteen receptors. Our results provide a structural basis for explaining the stability and low diffusion of receptors within clusters. cryoelectron microscopy | neurotransmitter receptor clustering | synapse | ligand-gated ion channel | tetratricopeptide repeat T he cytoplasmic protein rapsyn, also known as the 43K pro-tein, interacts with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the postsynaptic membrane at the neuromuscular junction, forming clusters where receptors are present in high concentration. Such clustering is necessary for efficient neurotransmission and, hence, muscle functioning. Rapsyn-deficient mice fail to form clusters, show severe muscle weakness and breathing difficulties, and die within hours after birth (1). Furthermore, many patients suffering from congenital myasthenic syndrome are found to have muta-tions in rapsyn (2). Rapsyn is a 43-kDa protein containing a myristoylation site necessary for submembrane localization, seven tetratricopeptide repeats (TRPs), a putative coiled-coil domain, and a RING-H2 domain (3). Two TPRs are necessary for rapsyn self-association, whereas association with receptor depends on the predicted coiled-coil (3, 4). Rapsyn is also linked through the RING-H2 domain to dystroglycan, a protein that indirectly binds actin cy-toskeleton (5). Recombinant rapsyn expressed in heterologous systems spontaneously aggregates underneath the plasma mem-brane (3), suggesting that rapsyn might first form a wide scaffold to which receptors can subsequently dock (6). On the other hand, rapsyn and the receptor are cotransported in membrane vesicles toward the plasma membrane, and the receptor is necessary for rapsyn clustering in C2 myotubes, raising the possibility that rapsyn only forms short bridges linking receptors together to form a large cluster (7–9). Furthermore, the number of rapsyn-binding sites per receptor (a heteropentamer) has been variously esti-mated to be between one and five (6, 10, 11). Therefore, the molecular details and organization of the receptor–rapsyn net-work are poorly understood. To address these issues, we applied cryoelectron tomography, combined with subtomogram averaging and image classification, to postsynaptic membranes isolated from the electric organ of Torpedo marmorata: a model system for the neuromuscular junction (12, 13). Three-dimensional structures were obtained of acetylcholine receptors complexed with rapsyn molecules in sev-eral specific arrangements. We show that the receptors connect to each other by small rapsyn bridges and that each receptor can have up to three bridges, the minimum number required to form a 2D network.},

These simulations reproduce experimental measurements suggesting that cholesterol prefers to be solvated by saturated acyl chains and has a low affinity for polyunsaturated fatty acids. Analyses of the simulation trajectory provide a detailed picture of both the transverse and lateral structures of the lipid bilayer membrane, along with a description of lipid and cholesterol dynamics at high temporal resolution. Comparison with a previous simulation of a pure phospholipid bilayer allows an atomic-level description of the changes in membrane structure and dynamics resulting from incorporation of cholesterol. The observed differential cholesterol interactions with saturated and polyunsaturated lipids provide a mechanism for the formation of laterally inhomogeneous membranes; thus, the simulation provides molecular-level insight into the formation of lipid rafts.},

abstract = {Membrane lipid composition varies greatly within submembrane compartments, different organelle membranes, and also between cells of different cell stage, cell and tissue types, and organisms. Environmental factors (such as diet) also influence membrane composition. The membrane lipid composition is tightly regulated by the cell, maintaining a homeostasis that, if disrupted, can impair cell function and lead to disease. This is especially pronounced in the brain, where defects in lipid regulation are linked to various neurological diseases. The tightly regulated diversity raises questions on how complex changes in composition affect overall bilayer properties, dynamics, and lipid organization of cellular membranes. Here, we utilize recent advances in computational power and molecular dynamics force fields to develop and test a realistically complex human brain plasma membrane (PM) lipid model and extend previous work on an idealized, “average” mammalian PM. The PMs showed both striking similarities, despite significantly different lipid composition, and interesting differences. The main differences in composition (higher cholesterol concentration and increased tail unsaturation in brain PM) appear to have opposite, yet complementary, influences on many bilayer properties. Both mixtures exhibit a range of dynamic lipid lateral inhomogeneities (“domains”). The domains can be small and transient or larger and more persistent and can correlate between the leaflets depending on lipid mixture, Brain or Average, as well as on the extent of bilayer undulations.},

abstract = {$\alpha$-Synuclein ($\alpha$S) is an abundant neuronal protein that accumulates in insoluble inclusions in Parkinson's disease (PD) and the related disorder, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). A central question about the role of $\alpha$S in the pathogenesis of PD and DLB concerns how this normally soluble protein assembles into insoluble aggregates associated with neuronal dysfunction. We recently detected highly soluble oligomers of $\alpha$S in normal brain supernatants and observed their augmentation in PD and DLB brains. Further, we found that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) enhanced $\alpha$S oligomerization in intact mesencephalic neuronal cells. We now report the presence of elevated PUFA levels in PD and DLB brain soluble fractions. Higher PUFA levels were also detected in the supernatants and high-speed membrane fractions of neuronal cells over-expressing wild-type or PD-causing mutant $\alpha$S. This increased PUFA content in the membrane fraction was accompanied by increased membrane fluidity in the $\alpha$S overexpressing neurons. In accord, membrane fluidity and the levels of certain PUFAs were decreased in the brains of mice genetically deleted of $\alpha$S. Together with our earlier observations, these results suggest that $\alpha$S-PUFA interactions help regulate neuronal PUFA levels as well as the oligomerization state of $\alpha$S, both normally and in human synucleinopathies.},

abstract = {Chronic stress is a major risk factor for several human disorders that affect modern societies. The brain is a key target of chronic stress. In fact, there is growing evidence indicating that exposure to stress affects learning and memory, decision making and emotional responses, and may even predispose for pathological processes, such as Alzheimer's disease and depression. Lipids are a major constituent of the brain and specifically signaling lipids have been shown to regulate brain function. Here, we used a mass spectrometry-based lipidomic approach to evaluate the impact of a chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) paradigm on the rat brain in a region-specific manner. We found that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) was the area with the highest degree of changes induced by chronic stress. Although the hippocampus presented relevant lipidomic changes, the amygdala and, to a greater extent, the cerebellum presented few lipid changes upon chronic stress exposure. The sphingolipid and phospholipid metabolism were profoundly affected, showing an increase in ceramide (Cer) and a decrease in sphingomyelin (SM) and dihydrosphingomyelin (dhSM) levels, and a decrease in phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and ether phosphatidylcholine (PCe) and increase in lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) levels, respectively. Furthermore, the fatty-acyl profile of phospholipids and diacylglycerol revealed that chronic stressed rats had higher 38 carbon(38C)-lipid levels in the hippocampus and reduced 36C-lipid levels in the PFC. Finally, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) levels in the PFC were found to be correlated with blood corticosterone (CORT) levels. In summary, lipidomic profiling of the effect of chronic stress allowed the identification of dysregulated lipid pathways, revealing putative targets for pharmacological intervention that may potentially be used to modulate stress-induced deficits.},

For many drugs, binding to serum albumin is a critical determinant of their distribution and pharmacokinetics; however, there have as yet been no high resolution crystal structures published of drug-albumin complexes. Here we describe high resolution crystal structures of HSA with two of the most widely used general anesthetics, propofol and halothane. In addition, we describe a crystal structure of HSA complexed with both halothane and the fatty acid, myristate. We show that the intravenous anesthetic propofol binds at two discrete sites on HSA in preformed pockets that have been shown to accommodate fatty acids. Similarly we show that the inhalational agent halothane binds (at concentrations in the pharmacologically relevant range) at three sites that are also fatty acid binding loci. At much higher halothane concentrations, we have identified additional sites that are occupied. All of the higher affinity anesthetic binding sites are amphiphilic in nature, with both polar and apolar parts, and anesthetic binding causes only minor changes in local structure.},

For one model mixture in particular, DPPC/DOPC/Chol, we have mapped phase boundaries for the full ternary system. For this mixture we observe two coexisting liquid phases over a wide range of lipid composition and temperature, with one phase rich in the unsaturated lipid and the other rich in the saturated lipid and cholesterol. We find a simple relationship between chain melting temperature and miscibility transition temperature that holds for both phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin lipids. We experimentally cross miscibility boundaries both by changing temperature and by the depletion of cholesterol with beta-cyclodextrin. Liquid domains in vesicles exhibit interesting behavior: they collide and coalesce, can finger into stripes, and can bulge out of the vesicle.

Temperature-dependent fluorescence quenching and steady-state polarization of the extrinsic fluorescent probe diphenylhexatriene (DPH) in model membranes composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (or sphingomyelin), a nitroxide spin-labeled phosphatidylcholine (12-SLPC), and a given steroid were combined to study the influence of the latter on (a) ordered lipid domain formation, (b) stabilization, and (c) the extension of the ordered lipid assemblies. The results of the two totally independent methods, fluorescence quenching by 12-SLPC and fluorescence polarization of DPH, show that all steroids examined, except for Chol and 25-hydroycholesterol, behave as lipid domain-disrupting compounds. Additionally, we found a positive correlation between the hydrophobicity of steroids and their ordered lipid domain-promoting activity. Comparison of the chemical structures disclosed some distinctive traits of ordered lipid domain-promoting steroids: (i) the presence of an isooctyl side chain bond at C17; (ii) the absence of carbons attached to C23 (i.e., C24-C27) in any of the other (domain-disrupting) steroids; (iii) the presence of a small polar group at position C3; and (iv) the absence of polar groups in the fused rings, with the exception of substitutions at position C3 in the A ring.},

abstract = {Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) constitute an influential group of molecules that promote health by an as yet unknown mechanism. They are structurally distinguished from less unsaturated fatty acids by the presence of a repeating {\{}double bond, short{\}}CH-CH2-CH{\{}double bond, short{\}} unit that produces an extremely flexible chain rapidly reorienting through conformational states. The most highly unsaturated case in point is docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) with 6 double bonds. This review will summarize how the high disorder of DHA affects the properties of the membrane phospholipids into which the PUFA incorporates, focusing upon the profound impact on the interaction with cholesterol. Results obtained with model membranes using an array of biophysical techniques will be presented. They demonstrate DHA and the sterol possesses a mutual aversion that drives the lateral segregation of DHA-containing phospholipids into highly disordered domains away from cholesterol. These domains are compositionally and organizationally the opposite of lipid rafts, the ordered domain enriched in predominantly saturated sphingolipids "glued" together by cholesterol that is believed to serve as the platform for signaling proteins. We hypothesize that DHA-rich domains also form in the plasma membrane and are responsible, in part, for the diverse range of health benefits associated with DHA. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Detergent-insoluble membrane domains, enriched in saturated lipids and cholesterol, have been implicated in numerous biological functions. To understand how cholesterol promotes domain formation, the effect of various sterols and sterol derivatives on domain formation in mixtures of the saturated lipid dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and a fluorescence quenching analogue of an unsaturated lipid was compared. Quenching measurements demonstrated that several sterols (cholesterol, dihydrocholesterol, epicholesterol, and 25-hydroxycholesterol) promote formation of DPPC-enriched domains. Other sterols and sterol derivatives had little effect on domain formation (cholestane and lanosterol) or, surprisingly, strongly inhibit it (coprostanol, androstenol, cholesterol sulfate, and 4-cholestenone). The effect of sterols on domain formation was closely correlated with their effects on DPPC insolubility. Those sterols that promoted domain formation increased DPPC insolubility, whereas those sterols that inhibit domain formation decreased DPPC insolubility. The effects of sterols on the fluorescence polarization of diphenylhexatriene incorporated into DPPC-containing vesicles were also correlated with sterol structure. These experiments indicate that the effect of sterol on the ability of saturated lipids to form a tightly packed (i.e., tight in the sense that the lipids are closely packed with one another) and ordered state is the key to their effect on domain formation. Those sterols that promote tight packing of saturated lipids promote domain formation, while those sterols that inhibited tight packing of saturated lipids inhibited domain formation. The ability of some sterols to inhibit domain formation (i.e., act as "anti-cholesterols") should be a valuable tool for examining domain formation and properties in cells.},

Upon binding of their agonists in the extracellular domain, the transmembrane pore opens, allowing ions to go through, via a gating mechanism that can be modulated by a number of drugs. Even though high-resolution structural information on pLGICs has increased in a spectacular way in recent years, both in bacterial and in eukaryotic systems, the structure of the open channel conformation of some intensively studied receptors whose structures are known in a nonactive (closed) form, such as Erwinia chrysanthemi pLGIC (ELIC), is still lacking. Here we describe a gammaproteobacterial pLGIC from an endo-symbiont of Tevnia jerichonana (sTeLIC), whose sequence is closely related to the pLGIC from ELIC with 28{\%} identity. We provide an X-ray crystallographic structure at 2.3 {\AA}in an active conformation, where the pore is found to be more open than any current conformation found for pLGICs. In addition, two charged restriction rings are present in the vestibule. Functional characterization shows sTeLIC to be a cationic channel activated at alkaline pH. It is inhibited by divalent cations, but not by quaternary ammonium ions, such as tetramethylammonium. Additionally, we found that sTeLIC is allosterically potentiated by aromatic amino acids Phe and Trp, as well as their derivatives, such as 4-bromo-cinnamate, whose cocrystal structure reveals a vestibular binding site equivalent to, but more deeply buried than, the one already described for benzodiazepines in ELIC.},

abstract = {Many neuroactive steroids potently and allosterically modulate pentameric ligand-gated ion channels, including GABAA receptors (GABAAR) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Allopregnanolone and its synthetic analog alphaxalone are GABAAR-positive allosteric modulators (PAMs), whereas alphaxalone and most neuroactive steroids are nAChR inhibitors. In this report, we used 11$\beta$-(p-azidotetrafluorobenzoyloxy) allopregnanolone (F4N3Bzoxy-AP), a general anesthetic and photoreactive allopregnanolone analog that is a potent GABAAR PAM, to characterize steroid-binding sites in the Torpedo $\alpha$2$\beta$$\gamma$$\delta$ nAChR in its native membrane environment. We found that F4N3Bzoxy-AP (IC50 = 31 $\mu$M) is 7-fold more potent than alphaxalone in inhibiting binding of the channel blocker [3H]tenocyclidine to nAChRs in the desensitized state. At 300$\mu$M, neither steroid inhibited binding of [3H]tetracaine, a closed-state selective channel blocker, or of [3H]acetylcholine. Photolabeling identified three distinct [3H]F4N3Bzoxy- AP-binding sites in the nAChR transmembrane domain: 1) in the ion channel, identified by photolabeling in the M2 helices of $\beta$Val-261 and $\delta$Val-269 (position M2-13$\beta$); 2) at the interface between the $\alpha$M1 and $\alpha$M4 helices, identified by photolabeling in$\alpha$M1 ($\alpha$Cys-222/$\alpha$Leu-223); and 3) at the lipid-protein interface involving $\gamma$Trp-453 (M4), a residue photolabeled by small lipophilic probes and promegestone, a steroid nAChR antagonist. Photolabeling in the ion channel and$\alpha$M1was higher in the nAChR-desensitized state than in the resting state and inhibitable by promegestone. These results directly indicate a steroidbinding site in the nAChR ion channel and identify additional steroid-binding sites also occupied by other lipophilic nAChR antagonists.},

abstract = {In the absence of activating anionic lipids and cholesterol, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) from Torpedo adopts an uncoupled conformation that does not usually gate open in response to agonist. The uncoupled conformation binds both agonists and non-competitive channel blockers with a lower affinity than the desensitized state, consistent with both the extracellular agonist-binding and transmembrane channel-gating domains individually adopting resting-state like conformations. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the binding of the agonist, acetylcholine, and two fluorescent channel blockers, ethidium and crystal violet, to resting, desensitized and uncoupled nAChRs in reconstituted membranes. The measured Kd for acetylcholine binding to the uncoupled nAChR is similar to that for the resting state, confirming that the agonist binding site adopts a resting-state like conformation. Although both ethidium and crystal violet bind to the resting and desensitized channel pores with distinct affinities, no binding of either probe was detected to the uncoupled nAChR. Our data suggest that the transmembrane domain of the uncoupled nAChR adopts a conformation distinct from that of the resting and desensitized states. The lack of binding is consistent with a more constricted channel pore, possibly along the lines of what is observed in crystal structures of the prokaryotic homolog, ELIC.},

We show here that anionic lipids with relatively small headgroups, and thus the greatest ability to influence lipid packing/bilayer physical properties, are the most effective at stabilizing an agonist- activatable receptor. The differing abilities of anionic lipids to stabilize an activatable receptor stem from differing abilities to preferentially favor resting over both uncoupled and desensitized conformations. Anionic lipids thus modulate multiple acetylcholine receptor conformational equilibria. Our data suggest that both lipids and membrane physical properties act as classic allosteric modulators influencing function by interacting with and thus preferentially stabilizing different native acetylcholine receptor conformational states. {\textcopyright} 2009 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

  abstract = {Lipids influence the ability of Cys-loop receptors to gate open in response to neurotransmitter binding, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. With the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) from Torpedo, current models suggest that lipids modulate the natural equilibrium between resting and desensitized conformations. We show that the lipid-inactivated nAChR is not desensitized, instead it adopts a novel conformation where the allosteric coupling between its neurotransmitter-binding sites and transmembrane pore is lost. The uncoupling is accompanied by an unmasking of previously buried residues, suggesting weakened association between structurally intact agonist-binding and transmembrane domains. These data combined with the extensive literature on Cys-loop receptor-lipid interactions suggest that the M4 transmembrane helix plays a key role as a lipid-sensor, translating bilayer properties into altered nAChR function.},

  abstract = {Disorders of muscle lipid metabolism may involve intramyocellular triglyceride degradation, carnitine uptake, long-chain fatty acids mitochondrial transport, or fatty acid {\$}\beta{\$}-oxidation. Three main diseases leading to permanent muscle weakness are associated with severe increased muscle lipid content (lipid storage myopathies): primary carnitine deficiency, neutral lipid storage disease and multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. A moderate lipidosis may be observed in fatty acid oxidation disorders revealed by rhabdomyolysis episodes such as carnitine palmitoyl transferase II, very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiencies, and in recently described phosphatidic acid phosphatase deficiency. Respiratory chain disorders and congenital myasthenic syndromes may also be misdiagnosed as fatty acid oxidation disorders due to the presence of secondary muscle lipidosis. The main biochemical tests giving clues for the diagnosis of these various disorders are measurements of blood carnitine and acylcarnitines, urinary organic acid profile, and search for intracytoplasmic lipid on peripheral blood smear (Jordan's anomaly). Genetic analysis orientated by the results of biochemical investigation allows establishing a firm diagnosis. Primary carnitine deficiency and multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency may be treated after supplementation with carnitine, riboflavine and coenzyme Q10. New therapeutic approaches for fatty acid oxidation disorders are currently developed, based on pharmacological treatment with bezafibrate, and specific diets enriched in medium-chain triglycerides or triheptanoin. {\textcopyright}2010 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract  = {Neurotransmitter receptors, the macromolecules specialized in decoding the chemical signals encrypted in the chemical signaling mechanism in the nervous system, occur either at the somatic cell surface of chemically excitable cells or at specialized subcellular structures, the synapses. Synapses have lipid compositions distinct from the rest of the cell membrane, suggesting that neurotransmitter receptors and their scaffolding and adaptor protein partners require specific lipid habitats for optimal operation. In this review we discuss some paradigmatic cases of neurotransmitter receptor-lipid interactions, highlighting the chemical nature of the intervening lipid species and providing examples of the receptor mechanisms affected by interaction with lipids. The focus is on the effects of cholesterol, glycerophospholipids and covalent fatty acid acylation on neurotransmitter receptors. We also briefly discuss the role of lipid phase states involving lateral heterogeneities of the host membrane known to modulate membrane transport, protein sorting and signaling. Modulation of neurotransmitter receptors by lipids occurs at multiple levels, affecting a wide span of activities including their trafficking, sorting, stability, residence lifetime at the cell surface, endocytosis, and recycling, among other important functional properties at the synapse.},

  abstract = {The lateral mobility of surface receptors can define the signaling properties of a synapse and rapidly change synaptic function. Here we use single-particle tracking with Quantum Dots to follow nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on the surface of chick ciliary ganglion neurons in culture. We find that both heteropentameric alpha3-containing receptors (alpha3*-nAChRs) and homopentameric alpha7-containing receptors (alpha7-nAChRs) access synaptic domains by lateral diffusion. They have comparable mobilities and display Brownian motion in extrasynaptic space but are constrained and move more slowly in synaptic space. The two receptor types differ in the nature of their synaptic restraints. Disruption of lipid rafts, PDZ-containing scaffolds, and actin filaments each increase the mobility of alpha7-nAChRs in synaptic space while collapse of microtubules has no effect. The opposite is seen for alpha3*-nAChRs where synaptic mobility is increased only by microtubule collapse and not the other manipulations. Other differences are found for regulation of alpha3*-nAChR and alpha7-nAChR mobilities in extrasynaptic space. Most striking are effects on the immobile populations of alpha7-nAChRs and alpha3*-nAChRs. Disruption of either lipid rafts or PDZ scaffolds renders half of the immobile alpha3*-nAChRs mobile without changing the proportion of immobile alpha7-nAChRs. Similar results were obtained with chick sympathetic ganglion neurons, though regulation of receptor mobility differed in at least one respect from that seen with ciliary ganglion neurons. Control of nAChR lateral mobility, therefore, is determined by mechanisms that are domain specific, receptor subtype dependent, and cell-type constrained. The outcome is a system that could tailor nicotinic signaling capabilities to specific needs of individual locations.},

  abstract = {Epidemiological studies have identified a negative correlation between smoking and the development of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, and in some studies, Alzheimer's disease. These findings have been attributed to the ability of nicotine to act as a neuroprotective agent. A large number of studies demonstrate that nicotine can protect against neuronal death in vitro and in vivo, and the mechanisms underlying the ability of nicotine to protect against excitotoxicity and amyloid-? toxicity are beginning to be elucidated. Despite the compelling evidence that nicotine is neuroprotective, it is clear that nicotine can be toxic under some circumstances. The balance between nicotine neuroprotection and toxicity depends on dose, developmental stage and regimen of administration. Therefore, a full understanding of the molecular and cellular effects of nicotine on signaling pathways relevant to neuronal survival is critical for informed drug discovery of nicotinic compounds to combat human neurodegeneration. This review summarizes recent studies related to the mechanisms underlying nicotine-mediated neuroprotection, and addresses issues that are relevant to use of nicotine as a neuroprotective agent in vivo.},

We found that ELIC, a pLGIC from Erwinia chrysanthemi, can be functionally inhibited by isoflurane and other anesthetics. Structures of ELIC co-crystallized with isoflurane in the absence or presence of an agonist revealed double isoflurane occupancies inside the pore near T237(6') and A244(13'). A pore-radius contraction near the extracellular entrance was observed upon isoflurane binding. Electrophysiology measurements with a single-point mutation at position 6' or 13' support the notion that binding at these sites renders isoflurane inhibition. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that isoflurane binding was more stable in the resting than in a desensitized pore conformation. This study presents compelling evidence for a direct pore-binding mechanism of isoflurane inhibition, which has a general implication for inhibitory action of general anesthetics on pLGICs.},

Activation of the GABAA receptor by the neurosteroid allopregnanolone can be inhibited competitively by thyroid hormone (L- 3,3′,5-triiodothyronine, or T3), but modulation of nAChR by T3 or neurosteroids has not been investigated. Here we show that allopregnanolone inhibits the nAChR from Torpedo californica at micromolar concentrations, as do T3 and the anionic neurosteroid pregnenolone sulfate (PS). We test for the role of protein and ligand charge in mediated receptor inhibition by varying pH in a narrow range around physiological pH. We find that both T3 and PS become less potent with increasing pH, with remarkably similar trends in IC50 when T3 is neutral at pH {\textless} 7.3. After deprotonation of T3 (but no additional deprotonation of PS) at pH 7.3, T3 loses potency more slowly with increasing pH than PS. We interpret this result as indicating the negative charge is not required for inhibition but does increase activity. Finally, we show that both T3 and PS affect nAChR channel desensitization, which may implicate a binding site homologous to one that was recently indicated for accelerated desensitization of the GABAA receptor by PS.},

A special attention is paid to lipid asymmetry and cholesterol content of the membranes. The loss of lipid asymmetry, which is common for cancer cells, leads to a decrease in their permeability to cisplatin by one order of magnitude in comparison to the membranes of normal cells. The change in the cholesterol molar ratio from 0{\%} to 33{\%} also decreases the permeability of the membrane by approximately one order of magnitude. The permeability of pure DOPC membrane is 5–6 orders of magnitude higher than one of the membranes with realistic lipid composition, which makes it as an inadequate model for the studies of drug permeability.},

abstract = {Whether lipid rafts are present in the membranes of living cells remains hotly disputed despite their incontrovertible existence in liposomes at 298 K. In attempts to resolve this debate, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been extensively used to study lipid phase separation at high resolution. However, computation has been of limited utility in this respect because the experimental distributions of phases in lamellar lipid mixtures are poorly reproduced by simulations. In particular, all-atom (AA) approaches suffer from restrictions on accessible time scales and system sizes whereas the more efficient coarse-grained (CG) force fields remain insufficiently accurate to achieve correspondence with experiment. In this work, we refine the CG Martini parameters for the high- and low-melting temperature (Tm) lipids 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC). Our approach involves the modification of bonded Martini parameters based on fitting to atomistic simulations conducted with the CHARMM36 lipid force field. The resulting CG parameters reproduce experimental structural and thermodynamic properties of homogeneous lipid membranes while concurrently improving simulation fidelity to experimental phase diagrams of DPPC, DOPC, and cholesterol lipid mixtures. Importantly, the refined parameters provide much better phase accuracy for regions near the critical point that mimic the lipid concentrations under physiological conditions.},

By modulation of these properties, membrane protein function can be affected. Furthermore, inhomogeneous lipid mixing and domains of lipid enrichment/depletion can sort proteins and provide optimal local environments. Recent coarse-grained (CG) Martini molecular dynamics efforts have provided glimpses into lipid organization of different PMs: an "Average" and a "Brain" PM. Their high complexity and large size require long simulations (∼80 $\mu$s) for proper sampling. Thus, these simulations are computationally taxing. This level of complexity is beyond the possibilities of all-atom simulations, raising the question-what complexity is needed for "realistic" bilayer properties? We constructed CG Martini PM models of varying complexity (63 down to 8 different lipids). Lipid tail saturations and headgroup combinations were kept as consistent as possible for the "tissues'" (Average/Brain) at three levels of compositional complexity. For each system, we analyzed membrane properties to evaluate which features can be retained at lower complexity and validate eight-component bilayers that can act as reliable mimetics for Average or Brain PMs. Systems of reduced complexity deliver a more robust and malleable tool for computational membrane studies and allow for equivalent all-atom simulations and experiments.},

Often, these proteins are embedded within a membrane, which creates particular experimental challenges to surmount. This has resulted in computational methods providing a valuable complementary tool for some time now, especially in the development of working models at atomic resolution. Indeed, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are now routinely applied to new structures, either as part of the initial analysis or as part of an automated pipeline. Such simulations have proven extremely useful in terms of characterizing the inherent underlying conformational dynamics or providing insight into the interactions with the surrounding lipid molecules. However, MD simulations are capable of providing much more sophisticated information, including fundamental kinetic and thermodynamic properties of transitions between states and a description of how those transitions are influenced by the presence of ligands. There is a very large array of advanced simulation methods that can provide this information, but in this short review we limit ourselves to some selected examples of techniques that have given particular insight into proteins associated with molecular neurobiology. In this review, we highlight the use of i) Markov State Modelling to examine sodium dynamics in the dopamine transporter, ii) Metadynamics to explore neurotransmitter binding to a ligand-gated ion channel and iii) Steered MD to investigate conformational change in ionotropic glutamate receptors.},

abstract = {Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are spherical liposomes that are secreted by almost all forms of Gram-negative bacteria. The nanospheres contribute to bacterial pathogenesis by trafficking molecular cargo from bacterial membranes to target cells at the host-pathogen interface. We have simulated the interaction of OMVs with host cell membranes to understand why OMV uptake depends on the length of constituent lipopolysaccharide macromolecules. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we show that lipopolysaccharide lipid length affects OMV shape at the host-pathogen interface: OMVs with long (smooth-type) lipopolysaccharide lipids retain their spherical shape when they interact with host cell membranes, whereas OMVs with shorter (rough-type) lipopolysaccharide lipids distort and spread over the host membrane surface. In addition, we show that OMVs preferentially coordinate domain-favoring ganglioside lipids within host membranes to enhance curvature and affect the local lipid composition. We predict that these differences in shape preservation affect OMV internalization on long timescales: spherical nanoparticles tend to be completely enveloped by host membranes, whereas low sphericity nanoparticles tend to remain on the surface of cells.},

abstract = {Cell membranes contain a large variety of lipid types and are crowded with proteins, endowing them with the plasticity needed to fulfill their key roles in cell functioning. The compositional complexity of cellular membranes gives rise to a heterogeneous lateral organization, which is still poorly understood. Computational models, in particular molecular dynamics simulations and related techniques, have provided important insight into the organizational principles of cell membranes over the past decades. Now, we are witnessing a transition from simulations of simpler membrane models to multicomponent systems, culminating in realistic models of an increasing variety of cell types and organelles. Here, we review the state of the art in the field of realistic membrane simulations and discuss the current limitations and challenges ahead.},

abstract = {Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are spherical liposomes that are secreted by almost all forms of Gram-negative bacteria. The nanospheres contribute to bacterial pathogenesis by trafficking molecular cargo from bacterial membranes to target cells at the host-pathogen interface. We have simulated the interaction of OMVs with host cell membranes to understand why OMV uptake depends on the length of constituent lipopolysaccharide macromolecules. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we show that lipopolysaccharide lipid length affects OMV shape at the host-pathogen interface: OMVs with long (smooth-type) lipopolysaccharide lipids retain their spherical shape when they interact with host cell membranes, whereas OMVs with shorter (rough-type) lipopolysaccharide lipids distort and spread over the host membrane surface. In addition, we show that OMVs preferentially coordinate domain-favoring ganglioside lipids within host membranes to enhance curvature and affect the local lipid composition. We predict that these differences in shape preservation affect OMV internalization on long timescales: spherical nanoparticles tend to be completely enveloped by host membranes, whereas low sphericity nanoparticles tend to remain on the surface of cells.},

Irrespective of membrane cholesterol content, interfacial water structure is largely perturbed by the presence of the membrane surface due to water-phospholipid interactions, which deplete the chance of hydrogen bonding among water molecules. In contrast, the addition of cholesterol suppresses the disturbing effect of the membrane on water-water hydrogen bonding as cholesterol provides a more bulklike environment for the interfacial water molecules, as evidenced by enhancement of local water density, a reduction in their orientational bias, and increases in both the number of hydrogen bonds and the topological complexity of the hydrogen bond network.},

abstract = {The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in muscle is a ligand-gated ion channel with an ordered subunit arrangement of $\alpha$-$\gamma$-$\alpha$-$\delta$ -$\beta$. The subunits are sequestered in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and assembled into the pentameric arrangement prior to their exit to the cell surface. Mutating the Arg313-Lys314 sequence in the large cytoplasmic loop of the $\alpha$-subunit to K314Q promotes the trafficking of the mutant unassembled $\alpha$-subunit from the ER to the Golgi in transfected HEK cells, identifying an important determinant that modulates the ER to Golgi trafficking of the subunit. The association of the K314Q $\alpha$-subunit with $\gamma$-COP, a component of COP I coats implicated in Golgi to ER anterograde transport, is diminished to a level comparable to that observed for wild-type $\alpha$-subunits when co-expressed with the $\beta$-, $\delta$-, and $\gamma$-subunits. This suggests that the Arg313-Lys314 sequence is masked when the subunits assemble, thereby enabling ER to Golgi trafficking of the $\alpha$-subunit. Although unassembled K314Q $\alpha$-subunits accumulate in the Golgi, they are not detected at the cell surface, suggesting that a second post-Golgi level of capture exists. Expressing the K314Q $\alpha$-subunit in the absence of the other subunits in ubiquitinating deficient cells (ts20) results in detecting this subunit at the cell surface, indicating that ubiquitination functions as a post-Golgi modulator of trafficking. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis that subunit assembly sterically occludes the trafficking signals and ubiquitination at specific sites. Following the masking of these signals, the assembled ion channel expresses at the cell surface.},

abstract = {Dok7 is a peripheral membrane protein that is associated with the MuSK receptor tyrosine kinase. Formation of the Dok7/MuSK/membrane complex is required for the activation of MuSK. This is a key step in the complex exchange of signals between neuron and muscle, which lead to neuromuscular junction formation, dysfunction of which is associated with congenital myasthenic syndromes. The Dok7 structure consists of a Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain and a Phosphotyrosine Binding (PTB) domain. The mechanism of the Dok7 association with the membrane remains largely unknown. Using multi-scale molecular dynamics simulations we have explored the formation of the Dok7 PH/membrane complex. Our simulations indicate that the PH domain of Dok7 associates with membranes containing phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs) via interactions of the $\beta$1/$\beta$2, $\beta$3/$\beta$4, and $\beta$5/$\beta$6 loops, which together form a positively charged surface on the PH domain and interact with the negatively charged headgroups of PIP molecules. The initial encounter of the Dok7 PH domain is followed by formation of additional interactions with the lipid bilayer, and especially with PIP molecules, which stabilizes the Dok7 PH/membrane complex. We have quantified the binding of the PH domain to the model bilayers by calculating a density landscape for protein/membrane interactions. Detailed analysis of the PH/PIP interactions reveal both a canonical and an atypical site to be occupied by the anionic lipid. PH domain binding leads to local clustering of PIP molecules in the bilayer. Association of the Dok7 PH domain with PIP lipids is therefore seen as a key step in localization of Dok7 to the membrane and formation of a complex with MuSK.},

@article{Lombardi2019,
abstract = {The effects of ionotropic $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABA-A, GABAA ) activation depends critically on the Cl−-gradient across neuronal membranes. Previous studies demonstrated that the intracellular Cl−-concentration ([Cl− ]i ) is not stable but shows a considerable amount of activity-dependent plasticity. To characterize how membrane properties and different molecules that are directly or indirectly involved in GABAergic synaptic transmission affect GABA-induced [Cl− ]i changes, we performed compartmental modeling in the NEURON environment. These simulations demonstrate that GABA-induced [Cl− ]i changes decrease at higher membrane resistance, revealing a sigmoidal dependency between both parameters. Increase in GABAergic conductivity enhances [Cl− ]i with a logarithmic dependency, while increasing the decay time of GABAA receptors leads to a nearly linear enhancement of the [Cl− ]i changes. Implementing physiological levels of HCO3−-conductivity to GABAA receptors enhances the [Cl− ]i changes over a wide range of [Cl− ]i, but this effect depends on the stability of the HCO3− gradient and the intracellular pH. Finally, these simulations show that pure diffusional Cl−-elimination from dendrites is slow and that a high activity of Cl−-transport is required to improve the spatiotemporal restriction of GABA-induced [Cl− ]i changes. In summary, these simulations revealed a complex interplay between several key factors that influence GABA-induced [Cl]i changes. The results suggest that some of these factors, including high resting [Cl− ]i, high input resistance, slow decay time of GABAA receptors and dynamic HCO3− gradient, are specifically adapted in early postnatal neurons to facilitate limited activity-dependent [Cl− ]i decreases.},

abstract = {Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) are important neuroreceptors, embedded in neuronal membranes, that mediate fast synaptic transmission. The molecular details of their working mechanisms have still to be fully unravelled due to their complexity and limited structural information available. Here we focus on a potential molecular switch in a prototypical pLGIC, the serotonin-activated 5-HT 3 receptor, consisting of the trans-cis isomerization of a proline at the interface between the extracellular and transmembrane domain. Mutagenesis electrophysiology experiments previously showed that if such isomerization could not take place, the channel would not open, but the hypothetical role of this mechanism as key to channel gating is still debated. We investigate this switch within the receptor with molecular dynamics and enhanced sampling simulations. We analyze how the isomerization free energy landscape is affected by the receptor environment in comparison to simplified models. Moreover, we reveal how the isomerization, in turn, affects the structural and electrostatic properties of the receptor at the extracellular-transmembrane domain interface, e.g., by tuning the ion selectivity filter. {\textcopyright}},

Even today, whether these nanoscale cholesterol-rich domains are present in cell membranes is not completely resolved. However, especially in the last few years, a rich body of literature has demonstrated both the presence and the importance of non-random distribution of biomolecules on the membrane, which is the focus of this review. These new developments have pushed the experimental limits of detection and have brought us closer to observing lipid domains in the plasma membrane of live cells. Characterization of biomolecules associated with lipid rafts has revealed a deep connection between biological regulation and function and membrane compositional heterogeneities. Finally, tantalizing new developments in the field have demonstrated that lipid domains might not just be associated with the plasma membrane of eukaryotes but could potentially be a ubiquitous membrane-organizing principle in several other biological systems.

Structural studies combined with biophysical and molecular simulation investigations reveal interaction sites for specific lipids on membrane protein structures. For K channels, PIP2 plays a key role in regulating Kv and Kir channels. Likewise, several recent cryo-EM structures of TRP channels have revealed bound lipids, including PIP2 and cholesterol. Among the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel family, structural and biophysical studies suggest the M4 TM helix may act as a lipid sensor, e.g., forming part of the binding sites for neurosteroids on the GABAA receptor. Structures of GPCRs have revealed multiple cholesterol sites, which may modulate both receptor dynamics and receptor oligomerization. PIP2 also interacts with GPCRs and may modulate their interactions with G proteins. Overall, it is evident that multiple lipid binding sites exist on channels and receptors that modulate their function allosterically and are potential druggable sites.},

However, the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of astroglial α7 nAChRs are not well studied. Therefore, we evaluated the role of astroglial α7 nAChR activation in neuroinflammation. Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of α7 nAChR activation were evaluated in an in vitro mouse model of neuroinflammation using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in primary astrocyte cultures. α7 nAChR anti-inflammatory effects on the NF-κB pathway were evaluated using ELISA, gene expression analysis, immunofluorescence, and western blotting. Antioxidant effect of α7 nAChR activation on expression profiles of canonical Nrf2 target genes was examined by quantitative PCR and western blotting. The role of the Nrf2 pathway in α7 nAChR-mediated anti-inflammatory response was evaluated using Nrf2 knockout astrocytes. Brain ex vivo NF-κB luciferase signals were evaluated after treatment with an α7 nAChR agonist in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-injected NF-κB luciferase reporter mouse model. Astrocytes treated with the α7 nAChR partial agonist (GTS21) showed significantly reduced LPS-mediated secretion of inflammatory cytokines and this effect was reversed by the α7 nAChR antagonist methyllycaconitine (MLA) and by knockdown of α7 nAChR expression with a short hairpin RNA. Further, α7 nAChR activation blocked LPS-mediated NF-κB nuclear translocation indicating that the observed anti-inflammatory effect may be mediated through inhibition of the NF-κB pathway. Treatment with GTS21 also upregulated canonical Nrf2 antioxidant genes and proteins suggesting antioxidant properties of α7 nAChR in astrocytes. Using an astrocyte conditioned media approach, we demonstrated reduction in neuronal apoptosis when astrocytes were pretreated with GTS21. Finally, in an in vivo neuroinflammation model using LPS in NF-κB luciferase reporter mice, we demonstrated reduction in LPS-induced NF-κB activity and pro-inflammatory cytokines with GTS21 treatment in brain tissue. Our results suggest that activating astroglial α7 nAChRs may have a role in neuroprotection by decreasing inflammation and oxidative stress, and therefore could have therapeutic implication for disease modifying treatments of neurodegenerative diseases.},

Here, we reparametrize these residues either through reassignment of particle types or by introducing embedded charges. The new parameters are tested with respect to partitioning across a lipid bilayer, membrane binding of Wimley-White peptides, and dimerization free energy in solvents of different polarity. In addition, we improve some of the bonded terms in the Martini protein force field that lead to a more realistic length of α-helices and to improved numerical stability for polyalanine and glycine repeats.
