%Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (\plgic) are a family of essential channels responsible for synaptic function in mammals. \plgic s are functionally dependent on their environment's lipid composition. The local interactions and direct lipids-proteins contacts are poorly resolved. \plgic~ are conserved across structures and have been observed to function in similar lipid compositions.

This thesis reports on molecular simulations of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (\plgic s) in both model and quasi-realistic membranes.  The goal is to identify specific \plgic~boundary lipids, how they are distributed around a \plgic's transmembrane domain (TMD), and predict specific lipid binding affinities. To accomplish this we use coarse grained molecular dynamics simulation (CGMD). We present four projects examining  \plgic s in a series of model and quasi-native membranes.%Model membranes are useful tools for predicting boundary lipids and boundary lipid distributions but experimental studies have largely ignored native membranes. 
%Due to how small lipids are compared to \plgic s and membranes' fluid nature, determining boundary lipid interaction is non-trivial.  Coarse grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations are used to 1) predict general boundary lipids and 2) how these lipids were distributed around \plgic s. MD simulations act as a computational microscope and is optimal for dealing with molecular fluids.

For project one, we determine which lipid domain a \nachr~resides in through nearest neighbor analysis and boundary lipid enrichment across membrane compositions, and predict boundary lipid distributions for multiple membranes consisting of PUFAs, saturated lipids, and cholesterol. In the second project we expand on project one by simulating \nachr s in non-domain forming membranes containing the same acyl-chain fractions but different lipid topologies. Comparing the previous domain and current non-domain forming simulations, we analyzed the difference in bound acyl-chain saturation, protein subunit-subunit interactions, and differences in boundary lipid distributions. 
Third, we simulated ELIC as a model \plgic~in binary model membranes consisting of neutral and anionic lipids. Using both 1D enrichment and 2D density analysis we predict anionic boundary lipid distributions around the annulus of Erwinia ligand-gated ion channel (ELIC). These model membrane studies paved the way for the fourth study: simulating \nachr~in quasi-native neuronal membranes consisting of 36 unique lipid species and both neutral and anionic head groups. We use polar density enrichment analysis to predict specific boundary lipids and introduce a new method for calculating affinities for lipids occupying protein binding sites. 

%To better understand the interplay between \plgic s and PUFAs we simulate a series of ternary domain forming  using a neuromuscular \nachr. To observe the effect of domain and non-domain forming model membranes on protein-protein dimerization and boundary lipid distribution by simulate 1 to 4 neuromuscular \nachr~in domain and non-domain forming ternary model membranes of cholesterol, saturated fatty acids, and n-3 PUFAs

%    CG-MD simulations play the role of a "computational microscope" to visualize lipid diffusion and various feasible lipid-protein arrangements in thermodynamically equilibrated systems over microseconds, allowing observations not readily seen experimentally.  Chapter 1 looks at where \nachr~resides in domain forming membranes. Chapter 2 compares domain and non-domain forming membranes for multiple \nachr~and predicts locations for lipid occupancy. Chapter 3 is computational work from a collaborative project, predicting anionic occupancy sites for the \plgic~ELIC. Chapter 4 embeds \nachr~in a quasi-native membrane, and tests the predicted occupancy sites from chapters 2 and 3 by calculating the binding affinity of acyl-chain saturation and head group charge.  }

\section{Pentameric Ligand-Gated Ion Channels}

Ion channels are transmembrane proteins that passively transport ions across membranes. Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (\plgic s) are ion channels made of five subunits and gated by various neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine, glycine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and serotonin. \plgic s are modulated by numerous drugs, such as alcohol \cite{Sauguet2013} or nicotine \citep{Celie2004}, and anesthetics like propofol \citep{Chen2019a,Abadji1993}, endogenous molecules like lipids \citep{Dacosta2013,Nemecz2016} and thyroid hormones \citep{Westergard2015,Moffett2019}. Mammalian \plgic s are essential proteins dedicated to neuronal function and are found in both the central and peripheral nervous system. \plgic s play various roles in neurological diseases related to inflammation \citep{Taly2009,Cornelison2016,Patel2017,Yocum2017,Egea2015},  addiction \citep{Cornelison2016}, chronic pain \citep{Xiong2012}, Alzheimer's Disease \citep{Walstab2010,Picciotto_Neuroprotection_2008,MartinRuiz_4_1999,Kalamida2007}, spinal muscular atrophy \citep{Arnold_Reduced_2004}, schizophrenia \citep{Haydar2010,Kalamida2007} and neurological autoimmune diseases \citep{Lennon_Immunization_2003, Kumari2008}.

\plgic s are found throughout the animal kingdom \citep{Jaiteh2016}. There are two categories of \plgic s: cationic and anionic. Cationic \plgic s, such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (\nachr s) and serotonin receptors (5-HT$_3$Rs), are responsible for stimulating action potential along axons. Anionic \plgic s, such as $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (\gabaa s), and glycine receptors (GlyRs) are responsible for inhibiting action potentials. 

Mammalian \plgic s contain three major domains: the extra-cellular domain (ECD), the transmembrane domain (TMD), and the poorly characterized inter-cellular domain (ICD), see Figure \ref{fig:struct}. The ECD is composed of beta-sheets, with ligand binding pockets at the inter-subunit regions. The TMD spans the membrane. Each TMD contains four alpha-helices, M1 to M4. Alpha-helices M1 and M3 form the ''body'' of the TMD, M2 makes up the channel's pore, and M4 is exposed to the membrane and is in direct contact with lipids.

\plgic~function is modulated by the membrane lipid composition \citep{Salari2014,Corradi2018,Cheng2018}. \plgic-lipid interactions have been studied for more than 40 years, however the modulatory mechanism remains unclear \citep{Epstein1978,SCHIEBLER1978,Dalziel1980,Sunshine1994,Chen2007,Sogaard2006,Salari2014,Laverty2017,Cordero-Morales2018}.  One of the most well studied \plgic s is \nachr. When \nachr s are reconstituted in model membranes (synthetic membranes of 1 to 3 lipids) a minimum of $10-20\%$ cholesterol is required to restore native function to the channel. Anionic phospholipids, with cholesterol,  have also been shown to stabilize \nachr~under very specific conditions \citep{Ellena1983,Fong1986,Fong1987,Jones1988,Sunshine1994,DaCosta2009b,Hamouda2006a,DaCosta2004}. Yet is is not known where these lipids bind, with what affinity, or how they affect channel conformation. %Model membranes are frequently used to determine what \plgic's boundary lipids are. 

\section{Lipids and Membranes}

Lipids are a wide class of small amphiphilic molecules used biologically as signaling molecules \citep{Guesnet2011,Sezgin2012}, protein modulators \citep{Dacosta2013,Nemecz2016}, and essential component of membranes \cite{yeagle2016}. Two sub-lipid groupings are phospholipids and sterols  \citep{Burger2000,Simons2000,Shevchenko2010,buehler2016,yeagle2016}. Phospholipids are molecular structures consisting of a zwitterionic head groups, like phosphatidylcholine, or charged head groups, like phosphoserine, a glycerol- or sphingosine-back bone, and two fatty acid hydrocarbon chains (acyl-chains) which vary in both length and saturation. Saturated acyl-chains, such as the medium length palmitic acid(C16:0), add order to the overall membrane. Unsaturated  acyl-chains  decrease overall membrane order and increase membrane permeability. Unsaturated acyl-chains can be monounsaturated (a single kick cause by a double bond) like Oleic acid (18:1), or polyunsaturated (multiple kinks caused by multiple double bonds). The quintessential polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) is the n-3 PUFA docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6) (DHA). DHA plays a number of roles in membrane organization \citep{Stillwell2003a,Gawrisch2003}, and neurological disorders \citep{Guesnet2011,DeFelice2012,Manor2011,McNamara2008}.

Sterols are a group of small rigid molecules with small neutral head groups and short rigid tails. Sterols are found throughout bacteria (hopanoids) \citep{Ourisson1992}, plants (phytosterols) \citep{Mlayeh2010}, fungi (ergosterol)\citep{Schneiter1999}, and animals (cholesterol). Cholesterol is essential to hormone synthesis and signaling \cite{buehler2016}. In membranes, it decreases membrane permeability and the average area per lipid and adds order to the bulk membrane \citep{YeagleCH9}. Cholesterol is also an essential lipid to restore function to \nachr~when reconstituted into model membranes.  

Model membranes often contain cholesterol, saturated, and monounsaturated lipids, with neutral or anionic head groups. Synthesizing model membranes with cholesterol and homo-acidic saturated and unsaturated lipids can result in lipid domain formation. Domain formation is the de-mixing of ordered saturated lipids and cholesterol from less ordered unsaturated lipids, forming liquid ordered ($\lo$) and liquid disordered ($\ldo$) domains respectively\citep{Kaiser2009,Lingwood2010}, see Figure \ref{fig:domain}. Domain formation, which requires spatial separation of saturated and unsaturated chains, is possible for mixtures of homo-acidic lipids, but not for hetero-acidic lipids containing both a saturated and unsaturated chain.  Hetero-acidic lipids are more common in native membranes \citep{Isolated1969, Breckenridge1973,Barrantes1989a,Taguchi2010,Quesada2016,Ingolfsson2017b,Lorent2020}, so it is likely that well-defined domains are less common in such membranes. Model membranes are useful tools for developing predictive models, but they lack the lipid diversity and the physical traits of realistic membranes.

%Ideally if a \plgic~is found in either domain it is reasonable to assume the \plgic's boundary lipids will be the same as the domain's lipids. This is not always the case. \cite{Bermdez_Partition_2010} suggested \nachr resided the $\lo$ and $\ldo$ interface. %However, using non-domain forming lipids we predicted polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), cholesterol and saturated lipids sites around \nachr \cite{Woods2019}.  

The native membrane of model organisms such as \xo may have more than thirty phospholipid species \citep{Gamba2005,Ferreira2010} compared to the handful in model membranes. \plgic~native membranes, such as neuronal membranes or \textit{Torpedo} electric organs have more than 30 species of phospholipid \citep{Isolated1969, Taguchi2010, Breckenridge1973,Ingolfsson2017b,Barrantes1989a,Quesada2016}. When \nachr~is studied in \textit{Xenopus} oocytes, its current is reduced from native values but can be restored with lipid additives, such as asolectin \citep{Regost2003} to conduct ions. This suggests lipid diversity is not sufficient for native function, and that there are specific lipids required for \nachr~function not found in \xo or (not enough of these specific lipids to play a boundary role).

\section{Boundary Lipids}

Boundary lipids are lipids in direct contact with a protein's TMD.  In random mixtures, the boundary lipid distribution would reflect the bulk distribution, but there is significant evidence that specific binding of lipids plays a key role in channel function. The most well studied \plgic, \nachr, ~is functionally dependent on cholesterol and anionic lipids \citep{Dalziel1980,Ellena1983,M.CriadoH.Eibl1982,Fong1986,Fong1987,Jones1988a,Sunshine1994,DaCosta2009b}, and many of these studies have demonstrated a role for direct interactions. Yet the precise location of lipid binding sites for \plgic s are still relatively unknown. Structural biology has detected cholesterol and fatty acid binding sites in \plgic s \citep{Addona1998,Althoff2014,Laverty2017,Basak2017,Henault2019}. Brannigan et al 2008 \cite{Brannigan2008} demonstrate cholesterol embedded within \nachr~ helped stabilize the protein's structure. Similarly Cheng et al 2009 \cite{Cheng2009} showed both cholesterol and anionic lipids with small head groups like phosphatidic acid (PA) could bind non-annularly to neuronal $\alpha$4$\beta$2 nAChR, and the anionic head group stabilizes the ECD during gating. %\cite{Henault2019} show by mutagenesis removed predicted lipid binding sites from ELIC resulting in a drop in channel current.

The M4 alpha helices have been shown to play a role in lipid sensing \citep{Henault2015}.  Basak et al \cite{Basak2017} found DHA bound around the M4 region in GLIC. DHA is a highly flexible PUFA, and if it binds to M4 it may play a role in minimizing membrane deformation caused by M4.

% Structural biology has found potential cholesterol sites at the subunit interface \citep{Laverty2017, Budelier2019}, potential specific phospholipid sites in the inter-subunit site \citep{Basak2017,Henault2019}, and inter-subunit sites sites \citep{Kim2020}. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations predicted non-annular cholesterol site in \nachr~\citep{Brannigan2008}, cholesterol and anionic phospholipids favorably interacted with  \gabaa~over neutral phospholipid \citep{Cheng2009} and inter-subunit cholesterol sites in \gabaa~\citep{Hnin_A_2014}. 

\plgic s are structurally similar and it is likely that the distribution of acyl-chains and cholesterol is related across \plgic~sequences. Differences in \plgic~sequences may result in variation of charged lipid distribution. \nachr~and \gabaa~\\have positive amino acids in the lower portion of their M4 alpha helices, while ELIC has positive amino acids at inter-subunit sites, see Figures \ref{fig:aaa}. When boundary lipid requirements are not met, either by a complete absence or too few necessary lipid species, it is likely \plgic s will not maintain native current. 

%but sequentially different. While charged lipid may bind to different sites across the \plgic~family, .  Distribution of specific lipids may be critical to function and when a protein is reconstituted or grown in a non-native membrane it either lacks essential lipids or is in competition with other proteins for essential lipids, inpovereshes function.

%Hypothesized essential boundary lipids are cholesterol and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Cholesterol makes up $\sim40\%$ of the neuronal membrane and only $\sim20\%$ in \textit{Xenopus} oocytes. n-3 PUFAs compose $\sim15-20\%$ of phospholipids found in \plgic native membranes, but only $\leq10\%$ in \textit{Xenopus} oocyte. Cholesterol and n-3 PUFAs play complementary rolls in membranes. Cholesterol decreases membrane permeability and the average area per lipid, and adds order to the bulk membrane \citep{YeagleCH9}. n-3 PUFAs increases membrane permeability and decreases order in a membrane \cite{Stillwell2003a,Gawrisch2003}. However, both cholesterol and n-3 PUFAs assist in domain formation. 
%
%Occupation of \plgic s by specific boundary lipid appears to be driven by the \plgic's structure and and sequence. The M4 alpha-helices have the highest probability to interact with unsaturated lipids and cholesterol. We hypothesize that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) minimize the membrane deformation caused by the conical-star shape M4 alpha-helices provide, see Figure \ref{fig:struct}, and cholesterol helps stabilize the structure. Inter-subunit sites have the highest probability to interact with saturated lipids, n-3 PUFAs, and cholesterol. We hypothesize n-3 PUFAs and cholesterol stabilize the protein's structure, and saturated lipid's low flexibility fit interact favorably with \plgic's cylindrical inter-subunit sites. The sequence of the \plgic's structure dictates the location of anionic lipid binding. The prokaryotic \plgic~ELIC's inner inter-subunit sites tend to be occupied by anionic lipids, however \nachr's inner M4 sites tend to be occupied by anionic lipids. As such, the acyl-chain distribution of lipids does not appear to change significantly between \plgic s, but occupancy of head group charge various by protein sequence, see Figures \ref{fig:ELICGABA}a and \ref{fig:fig2} for domain partitioning, and Figures \ref{fig:aaa}b and \ref{fig:ELICGABA}b charged amino acids. 

\section{Approaches to Determining \plgic~Boundary Lipids}

It is experimentally challenging to capture the boundary lipid composition and and distribution for membrane channels. By nature lipids are small fluid molecules. Structural biology techniques such as cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and X-ray crystallography can demonstrate where lipids are binding \citep{Kumar2019,Henault2019} but not the probability of lipid binding. Furthermore, determining which lipids have bound can be challenging as cryo-EM and x-ray crystallography require frozen or ``solid'' structures to image. Due to lipid's fluid nature and multiple conformations, lipids introduce significant crystallographic disorder, which prevents identification lipid of species. 

Mass spectrometry (MS) can be used to determine boundary lipid composition, including how many of a specific lipid reside around a protein. MS is not an imaging technique and can not provide protein structure or conformation information. Like cryo-EM and x-ray crystallography, MS cannot provide functional information \citep{Lorenzen2010}. 
 
Functional experiments, such as electrophysiology and fluorescence quenching, can predict lipid modulated function by varying the membrane lipid concentration \citep{Criado1984}. However functional experiments cannot directly show if the lipids used affect the protein from the bulk, or from specific region of the protein. Mutagenesis may provide indirect information but is not straightforward to interpret.

MD simulations are an optimal approach to predicting protein boundary lipids. MD is inherently fluid with molecular resolution. Using crystal and cryo-EM structures embedded in membranes based on model or realistic membrane compositions, MD simulations can be used to visualize lipids occupying potential binding sites. Furthermore the ability to visualize protein-lipid interaction allows straight forward prediction of the interactions driving lipid binding. While not necessarily useful for predicting how lipids modulate protein function, MD can be run using open, closed, and desensitized states of channel proteins to track changes in the structural role lipids play. 

MD comes in multiple forms, though two of the most widely used are all atomistic (AA) and coarse grained (CG). AAMD, modeled using all the atoms in a molecule, is limited by the molecular complexity, system size, and a time step on the $\sim 2$ fs scale. Tracking lipid diffusion from the bulk to the protein is computationally expensive and not always a viable approach. CGMD reduces the resolution of a molecule, for instance, the MARTINI forcefield \citep{Marrink2007} combines $\sim4$ atoms into a single bead. The reduced resolution allows for complex and large scale molecular systems at relatively larger time step ($\sim10$ fs scale), allowing lipids to diffuse from the bulk to a channel and back. This makes CGMD a powerful technique for predicting boundary lipids, membrane deformation, and protein-protein interactions within a membrane.

\section{Goals of this Thesis}

This thesis aims to identify specific lipid binding sites on pLGICs, as well as the effect of lipid topology and bulk membrane composition on occupancy of these sites. CGMD has been used for various small proteins in model to realistic membranes \citep{Hung2011,Domanski2012,Parton2013,Flinner2015,Lin2018} but \plgic s had solely been simulated using AAMD in model membranes lacking many essential native lipids. AAMD simulations provide critical predictions of how lipids bind to specific sites around \plgic s and can predict how lipid are structurally important to proteins. CGMD allows complex lipid compositions to diffuse around one or more \plgic s and equilibrate to the most likely 1) boundary composition and 2) lipid distribution. Over four chapters, I will quantify the boundary lipids of pLGICs in a series of increasingly complex membranes, beginning with a simple model membrane and culminating in a quasi-native neuronal membrane.   

%Chapter 2 uses the n-6 and n-3 PUFAs Linolic acid (LA) and DHA, both prominent PUFAs in \textit{Torpedo}'s electric organ \citep{Barrantes1989a,Quesada2016} in two series of model ternary membranes consisting of one PUFA, palmitic acid, and cholesterol. A single neuromuscular \nachr \citep{Unwin2005} is embedded in both series of membranes to determine if \nachr resides in a $\lo$ or $\ldo$ domain and what are \nachr's boundary lipid. As of the publication of chapter 1, it was the first CGMD simulation to use a \plgic~in association with a n-3 PUFA.
%
%Chapters 3 and 4 focus on boundary lipid distributions. The work from chapter 2 is expanded on in chapter 3, using model ternary membranes of domain and non-domain forming DHA, palmitic acid, and cholesterol with one to four neuromuscular \nachr s \citep{Unwin2005} embedded in each membrane. The domain forming and non-domain forming series are used to predict 1) \nachr-\nachr~clustering between domain and non-domain forming membranes. 2) Determine the difference in boundary lipid acyl-chain distributions in domain and non-domain forming membranes. Chapter 4 uses model binary systems consisting of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPG) or 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE) and POPG with ELIC \citep{Pan2012} embedded in both series. Enrichment and polar density plots are used to determine whether neutral or anionic lipids are more favorable in ELIC's boundary lipid composition, and how anionic lipids are distributed.

%Chapter 5 unifies the elements of the previous chapters. 
Chapter 2 demonstrates neuromuscular \nachr-lipid \citep{Unwin2005} interaction in model PUFA rich domain forming membranes. I examine  protein-membrane domain partitioning, boundary lipid distributions and present a potential explanation for PUFA- and cholesterol-\nachr~interactions. Chapters 3 and 4 predict specific lipid occupancy sites around the TMD for lipid acyl-chain saturation and head group charge. Chapter 3 expands on the work of chapter 2, comparing \nachr~boundary lipid distributions in PUFA rich model membranes with and without domain formation. Chapter 4 does not consider PUFAs and focuses on the distribution of anionic lipids around ELIC \citep{Pan2012} embedded in binary non-domain forming membranes. Chapter 5 unifies the elements of the previous chapters. Unlike the previous model membranes, we use a quasi-neuronal membrane of 36 different lipid species with both neutral and anionic head groups \citep{Ingolfsson2017b}. We determine boundary lipid distributions for \nachr, quantify specific binding using a new affinity calculation method, and compare to  results from model membranes in chapters 2 to 4.

%Predicting boundary \plgic boundary lipid and specific sites of protein occupancy has been exhaustedly done in model computational membranes. These model membranes have provided invaluable predictive models, however \plgic~native boundary lipids are unknown. This thesis is the accumulation for four projects working to predict \plgic~boundary lipids in coarse-grained model and quasi-realistic membranes. Chapter 1 looks at where \nachr~resides in domain forming membranes. Chapter 2 compares domain and non-domain forming membranes for multiple \nachr~and predicts locations for lipid occupancy. Chapter 3 is computational work from a collaborative project, predicting anionic occupancy sites for the \plgic~ELIC. Chapter 4 embeds \nachr~in a quasi-native membrane, and tests the predicted occupancy sites from chapters 2 and 3 by calculating the binding affinity of acyl-chain saturation and head group charge.

\section*{Appendix A: Domain formation around \plgic s in membranes of n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids }

Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (\plgic) share a similar structure across both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. In mammals  \plgic s are essential neuronal receptors found in both the central and peripheral nervous system \citep{Jaiteh2016}. The extra-cellular domain (ECD) is composed of beta-sheets with agonist binding sites at inter-subunit sites \citep{Guros2020}. The transmembrane domain (TMD) resides in the membrane and is composed of 5 sets of 4 alpha-helices bundles (M1 to M4), see Figure \ref{fig:dom_plgic}A. 

\plgic~alpha-helices can be described as three rings. The pore made of M2s,  the central ring made of M1s and M3s, and the most external which is in direct contact with the membrane M4s. While M1-M3 helices are $\sim$ perpendicular to the membrane, M4 is slightly tilted towards the membrane. This tilt provides a star and a cone shape to \plgic s, see Figure \ref{fig:dom_plgic}a. We hypothesize there acyl-chain saturation specificity associated with the star/cone shape. 

We previously showed using domain forming model membranes,  \nachr~partitioned into PUFA rich liquid disordered domain $\ldo$ \citep{Sharp2019}. We chose two \plgic s, the homo-pentamer Erwinia ligand-gated ion channels (ELIC) and the hetero-pentamer $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (\gabaa) simulated in two series of model domain forming PUFA rich membranes. Series one and two consisted of 20 simulations each of the n-6 PUFA dilinoleoylphosphatidylcholine(DLiPC) or the n-3 PUFA \seqsplit{didocosahexaenoylphosphatidylethanolamine} (dDHA-PE) , the saturated lipid dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), and cholesterol. 

Using VMD as a computational microscope \citep{HUMP96} we observed \plgic~phase partitioning. All \plgic s simulated in these model membranes were observed to partition into $\ldo$ phases, consistent with \citep{Sharp2019}, see Figure \ref{fig:dom_plgic}.  n-6 PUFAs did not form well-defined domains, and while all three \plgic s are observed to reside in the $\ldo$ raft forming lipids intermittently play a boundary lipid role. n-3 PUFAs formed well-defined domains with the bulk of a \plgic~residing in the $\ldo$. However, in all cases, at least one side of the protein resides near the $\lo/\ldo$ interface. \plgic s at the $\lo/\ldo$ interface have a buffer of annular PUFAs. This suggests \plgic s partitioning to $\ldo$ phase is independent of protein sequence.
