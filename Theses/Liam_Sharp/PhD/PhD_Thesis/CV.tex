%\small{Undergraduate physics with certification in nanofabrication. Masters of Science in Computational and Integrative Biology. Currently PhD candidate in the  Computational and Integrative Biology program at Rutgers University Camden. I have an interest in lipid-protein interactions, training introductory scientists, and mathematical modeling. }

%\footnotesize{I will be receiving my Ph.D. from Rutgers University in Computational and Integrative Biology under the mentorship of Dr. Grace Brannigans lab. My dissertation aims to elucidate the boundary lipid composition of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) in both model and realistic neuronal membranes using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, I also show how other pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs), such as the bacterial channel ELIC, sort lipids. Iâ€™m looking for a position where I am applying molecular dynamics to study biological systems.%I am looking for a position to work on protein-small molecule interactions and tool development}

%       \item {\textit{Coarse-grained simulations of multiple subtypes of mammalian pLGICs in quasi-physiological membranes} : Pentameric ligand gated ion channels are frequently used in functional studies embedded in  \textit{Xenopus} oocytes, but are native to membranes similar to synapses. I run simulations in neuronal and \textit{Xenopus} oocytes to determine nAChR's boundary lipid composition to predict lipid additives for functional experiments in \textit{Xenopus} oocytes.}

%       \vspace{2pt}
%        \item {\textit{Investigation of the relative importance of pLGIC sequence versus shape in determining preferred lipid domain} : pLGICs sequence vary across species and even within individual species, despite all pLGICs sharing a common structure. It is unclear whether boundary lipids composition is driven by a protein's sequence or its structure. I have run multiple pLGICs in model native membranes to compare boundary lipid composition to better understand the effect these receptors' shape and sequence play on boundary lipid sorting.}
%%             \item \textit{Goal}: Determine the role pentameric ligand gated ion channels's sequence and structure play on organization of their boundary lipids.
