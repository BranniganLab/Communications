  abstract={Anionic lipids influence the ability of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor to gate open in response to neurotransmitter binding, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We show here that anionic lipids with relatively small headgroups, and thus the greatest ability to influence lipid packing/bilayer physical properties, are the most effective at stabilizing an agonist-activatable receptor. The differing abilities of anionic lipids to stabilize an activatable receptor stem from differing abilities to preferentially favor resting over both uncoupled and desensitized conformations. Anionic lipids thus modulate multiple acetylcholine receptor conformational equilibria. Our data suggest that both lipids and membrane physical properties act as classic allosteric modulators influencing function by interacting with and thus preferentially stabilizing different native acetylcholine receptor conformational states.},

Cholesterol is among the lipid membrane constituents most often observed to be co-crystallized with membrane proteins, and the cholesterol levels in cell membranes have been found to play an essential role in health and disease. Remarkably little is known about the mechanism of lipid regulation of membrane protein function in health as well as in disease.

Here we present an atomic model of the closed pore, obtained by electron microscopy of crystalline postsynaptic membranes. The pore is shaped by an inner ring of 5 -helices, which curve radially to create a tapering path for the ions, and an outer ring of 15 -helices, which coil around each other and shield the inner ring from the lipids. The gate is a constricting hydrophobic girdle at the middle of the lipid bilayer, formed by weak interactions between neighbouring inner helices. When acetylcholine enters the ligand-binding domain, it triggers rotations of the protein chains on opposite sides of the entrance to the pore. These rotations are communicated through the inner helices, and open the pore by breaking the girdle apart.},

The nature of the interactions involved and the different mechanisms through which membrane proteins segregate lipid domains are presented, in particular with regard to those induced by the {nAChR.} It may be concluded that coupling of favourable lipid‚Äìlipid and lipid‚Äìprotein interactions is a general condition for this phenomenon to occur.},

  abstract={Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors {(nAChRs)} play a key role in the normal physiology of nematodes and provide an established target site for anthelmintics. The free-living nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, has a large number of {nAChR} subunit genes in its genome and so provides an experimental model for testing novel anthelmintics which act at these sites. However, many parasitic nematodes lack specific genes present in C. elegans, and so care is required in extrapolating from studies using C. elegans to the situation in other nematodes. In this review the properties of C. elegans {nAChRs} are reviewed and compared to those of parasitic nematodes. This forms the basis for a discussion of the possible subunit composition of {nAChRs} from different species of parasitic nematodes. Currently our knowledge on this is largely based on studies using heterologous expression and pharmacological analysis of receptor subunits in Xenopus laevis oocytes. It is concluded that more information is required regarding the subunit composition and pharmacology of endogenous {nAChRs} in parasitic nematodes.},

  abstract={The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor {(nAChR)} is a key molecule involved in the propagation of signals in the central nervous system and peripheral synapses. Although numerous computational and experimental studies have been performed on this receptor, the structural dynamics of the receptor underlying the gating mechanism is still unclear. To address the mechanical fundamentals of {nAChR} gating, both conventional molecular dynamics {(CMD)} and steered rotation molecular dynamics {(SRMD)} simulations have been conducted on the cryo-electron microscopy {(cryo-EM)} structure of {nAChR} embedded in a dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine {(DPPC)} bilayer and water molecules. A 30-ns {CMD} simulation revealed a collective motion amongst C-loops, M1, and M2 helices. The inward movement of C-loops accompanying the shrinking of acetylcholine {(ACh)} binding pockets induced an inward and upward motion of the outer Œ≤-sheet composed of Œ≤9 and Œ≤10 strands, which in turn causes M1 and M2 to undergo anticlockwise motions around the pore axis. Rotational motion of the entire receptor around the pore axis and twisting motions among extracellular {(EC),} transmembrane {(TM),} and intracellular {MA} domains were also detected by the {CMD} simulation. Moreover, M2 helices undergo a local twisting motion synthesized by their bending vibration and rotation. The hinge of either twisting motion or bending vibration is located at the middle of M2, possibly the gate of the receptor. A complementary twisting-to-open motion throughout the receptor was detected by a normal mode analysis {(NMA).} To mimic the pulsive action of {ACh} binding, nonequilibrium {MD} simulations were performed by using the {SRMD} method developed in one of our laboratories. The result confirmed all the motions derived from the {CMD} simulation and {NMA.} In addition, the {SRMD} simulation indicated that the channel may undergo an open-close {(O} ‚Üî C) motion. The present {MD} simulations explore the structural dynamics of the receptor under its gating process and provide a new insight into the gating mechanism of {nAChR} at the atomic level.},

Most notable, phenylalanine and proline were too hydrophobic, and dimers formed by polar residues in apolar solvents did not bind strongly enough. Here, we reparametrize these residues either through reassignment of particle types or by introducing embedded charges. The new parameters are tested with respect to partitioning across a lipid bilayer, membrane binding of {Wimley‚ÄìWhite} peptides, and dimerization free energy in solvents of different polarity. In addition, we improve some of the bonded terms in the Martini protein force field that lead to a more realistic length of Œ±-helices and to improved numerical stability for polyalanine and glycine repeats.

  abstract={Motivation: Molecular simulation has historically been a low-throughput technique, but faster computers and increasing amounts of genomic and structural data are changing this by enabling large-scale automated simulation of, for instance, many conformers or mutants of biomolecules with or without a range of ligands. At the same time, advances in performance and scaling now make it possible to model complex biomolecular interaction and function in a manner directly testable by experiment. These applications share a need for fast and efficient software that can be deployed on massive scale in clusters, web servers, distributed computing or cloud resources. Results: Here, we present a range of new simulation algorithms and features developed during the past 4 years, leading up to the {GROMACS} 4.5 software package. The software now automatically handles wide classes of biomolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids and lipids, and comes with all commonly used force fields for these molecules built-in. {GROMACS} supports several implicit solvent models, as well as new free-energy algorithms, and the software now uses multithreading for efficient parallelization even on low-end systems, including windows-based workstations. Together with hand-tuned assembly kernels and state-of-the-art parallelization, this provides extremely high performance and cost efficiency for high-throughput as well as massively parallel simulations.

  abstract={Anionic lipids and cholesterols {(CHOL)} are critical to the function of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors {(nAChR).} We investigated their interactions with an open- and closed-channel alpha4beta2 {nAChR} by over 10 ns molecular dynamics simulations in a ternary lipid mixture of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine {(POPC),} 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidic acid {(POPA),} and {CHOL} with a ratio of 3:1:1 {(Haddadian} et al., J. Phys. Chem. B 2008, 112, 13981). On average there were 65 and 74 interfacial lipids around the closed- and open-channel alpha4beta2 {nAChR,} respectively, in the equilibrated simulation systems. In the open-channel system, 42\% of the interfacial {POPA} had acyl chains partially inserted into intra- or intersubunit cavities, as compared to only 7\% in the closed-channel alpha4beta2. No {CHOL} was found in cavities within single subunits, though some {CHOL} infiltrated into the gaps between subunits. Because of its smaller headgroup, {POPA} could access some nonannular sites where {POPC} could not easily reach due to steric exclusion. Furthermore, {POPA} acted not only as an acceptor for hydrogen bonding {(H} bonding) as {POPC} did, but also as a donor through its hydroxyl group for H bonding with the backbone of the protein. The charged headgroup of {POPA} allowed the lipid to form stable salt bridges with conserved Arg and Lys residues at the interfaces of the transmembrane {(TM)} and extracellular {(EC)} or intracellular {(IC)} domains of the alpha4beta2. A higher number of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds {(H} bonds) between {POPA} and the alpha4beta2 {nAChR} were found in the open system than in the closed system, suggesting a potential role of {POPA} in the equilibrium between different channel states. Most interfacial {POPA} molecules showed lower order parameters than the bulk {POPA} due to the mixed effect of gauche defects, hydrophobic mismatch, and the lipid orientations near the magic angle. These unique properties enable the interfacial {POPA} to achieve what {POPC} cannot with regard to specific interactions with the protein, thereby making {POPA} essential for the function of {nAChR.}},

Here we show that changes to the lipid composition of the plasma membrane in rat hippocampal neurons, through either acute treatment with drugs that remove cholesterol and breakdown sphingomyelin or chronic treatment with synthesis inhibitors for cholesterol and sphingomyelin, result in significant changes in the desensitization of Œ±7 {nAChRs.} These data provide evidence that the lipid composition of the plasma membrane is able to modulate the desensitization of $\alpha$7 {nAChRs,} which will be important for the development of new therapeutic reagents. Abstract‚ÄÇ The Œ±7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors {(nAChRs)} play an important role in cellular events such as neurotransmitter release, second messenger cascades, cell survival and apoptosis. In addition, they are a therapeutic target for the treatment of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, and drugs that potentiate $\alpha$7 {nAChRs} through the regulation of desensitization are currently being developed. Recently, these channels were found to be localized into lipid rafts. Here we show that the disruption of lipid rafts in rat primary hippocampal neurons, through cholesterol-scavenging drugs (methyl-Œ≤-cyclodextrin) and the enzymatic breakdown of sphingomyelin (sphingomyelinase), results in significant changes in the desensitization kinetics of native and expressed Œ±7 {nAChRs.} These effects can be prevented by cotreatment with cholesterol and sphingomyelin, and can be mimicked by treatment with cholesterol and sphingomyelin synthesis inhibitors (mevastatin and myriocin, respectively), suggesting that the effects on desensitization kinetics are indeed due to changes in the levels of cholesterol and sphingomyelin in the plasma membrane. These data provide new insights into the mechanism of desensitization of Œ±7 {nAChRs} by providing evidence that the lipid composition of the plasma membrane can modulate the activity of the Œ±7 {nAChRs.}},
