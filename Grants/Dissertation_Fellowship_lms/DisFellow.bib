abstract = {Functional membranes containing purified Torpedo californica acetylcholine receptor and dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) were prepared by a cholate dialysis procedure with lipid to protein ratios of 100-400 to 1 (mol/mol). Spin-labeled lipids were incorporated into the reconstituted membranes and into native membranes prepared from Torpedo electroplax, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded between 0 and 20 degrees C. The spin-labels included nitroxide derivatives of stearic acid (16-doxylstearic acid), androstane, phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), and phosphatidic acid (PA). The phospholipid spin-labels had 16-doxylstearic acid in the sn-2 position. All the spectra showed two components corresponding to a relatively mobile bilayer component and a motionally restricted "protein-perturbed" component. The relative amounts of mobile and perturbed components were quantitated by spectral subtraction and integration techniques. The mobile/perturbed ratio was somewhat temperature dependent, and the results are discussed in terms of exchange between mobile and perturbed environments. Plots of the mobile/perturbed ratios vs. lipid/protein ratios at 1 degree C gave straight lines from which the relative binding affinity of each spin-label and the number of perturbed lipids per receptor protein could be calculated. All the spin-labels gave similar values for the number of perturbed lipids (40 +/- 7), a number close to the number of lipids that will fit around the intramembranous perimeter of the receptor. The affinities of the spin-labeled lipids for the receptor relative to DOPC were androstane (K = 4.3) congruent to 16-doxylstearic acid (4.1) greater than PA (2.7) greater than PE (1.1) approximately PC (1.0) approximately PS (0.7). The lipids having the highest affinity for the acetylcholine receptor were also those that have the largest effects on the ion flux functional properties of the receptor, and the results are discussed in terms of lipid effects on receptor function.},

abstract = {Torpedo acetylcholine receptor was reconstituted into liposomes of pure synthetic lipids in order to study the influence of the lipid environment on affinity state transitions and the ion translocation function of the receptor. A critical concentration of 30 to 40{\%} of cholesteryl hemisuccinate was necessary in liposomes made of cholesteryl hemisuccinate and dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine to mimic the kinetics of agonist-induced state transitions observed in native membranes. With increasing chain length of the saturated lecithins, a marked increase in carbamylcholine dissociation constants was observed. Substitution by other dimyristoyl phospholipids for dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine had the same, though quantitatively less pronounced effects. Introduction of unsaturation in the acyl chains reverted the effect of increasing chain length. Unsaturated phosphatidylethanolamines in combination with 28-35 mol{\%} of cholesteryl hemisuccinate was the best lipid mixture for reconstitution of the receptor-gating function. When phosphatidylethanolamine was replaced totally or partially by other phospholipids with the same or different acyl chain composition, a marked decrease of ion transport was apparent, even when similar vesicle size, receptor incorporation, and agonist-induced affinity transitions were obtained. Therefore, the maintenance of the affinity state transitions of the reconstituted receptor is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the manifestation of the ion-gating receptor activity. On the other hand, the more unsaturated the acyl chains of phosphatidylethanolamine are, the higher the response that was observed, suggesting that a critical lipid packing is essential for the ion translocation function of the receptor.},

abstract = {At the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) self-associates to give rise to rapid muscle movement. While lipid domains have maintained nAChR aggregates in vitro, their specific roles in nAChR clustering are currently unknown. In the present study, we carried out coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations (CG-MD) of 1–4 nAChR molecules in two membrane environments: one mixture containing domain-forming, homoacidic lipids, and a second mixture consisting of heteroacidic lipids. Spontaneous dimerization of nAChRs was up to ten times more likely in domain-forming membranes; however, the effect was not significant in four-protein systems, suggesting that lipid domains are less critical to nAChR oligomerization when protein concentration is higher. With regard to lipid preferences, nAChRs consistently partitioned into liquid-disordered domains occupied by the omega-3 ($\omega$-3) fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA); enrichment of DHA boundary lipids increased with protein concentration, particularly in homoacidic membranes. This result suggests dimer formation blocks access of saturated chains and cholesterol, but not polyunsaturated chains, to boundary lipid sites.},

abstract = {Reconstituted nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) exhibit significant gain-of-function upon addition of cholesterol to reconstitution mixtures, and cholesterol affects the organization of nAChRs within domain-forming membranes, but whether nAChR partitions to cholesterol-rich liquid-ordered (“raft” or l o ) domains or cholesterol-poor liquid-disordered (l do ) domains is unknown. We use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to observe spontaneous interactions of cholesterol, saturated lipids, and polyunsaturated (PUFA) lipids with nAChRs. In binary Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine:Cholesterol (DPPC:CHOL) mixtures, both CHOL and DPPC acyl chains were observed spontaneously entering deep “non-annular” cavities in the nAChR TMD, particularly at the subunit interface and the $\beta$ subunit center, facilitated by the low amino acid density in the cryo-EM structure of nAChR in a native membrane. Cholesterol was highly enriched in the annulus around the TMD, but this effect extended over (at most) 5–10 {\AA}. In domain-forming ternary mixtures containing PUFAs, the presence of a single receptor did not significantly affect the likelihood of domain formation. nAChR partitioned to any cholesterol-poor l do domain that was present, regardless of whether the l do or l o domain lipids had PC or PE headgroups. Enrichment of PUFAs among boundary lipids was positively correlated with their propensity for demixing from cholesterol-rich phases. Long n-3 chains (tested here with Docosahexaenoic Acid, DHA) were highly enriched in annular and non-annular embedded sites, partially displacing cholesterol and completely displacing DPPC, and occupying sites even deeper within the bundle. Shorter n-6 chains were far less effective at displacing cholesterol from non-annular sites.},

abstract = {Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) are ubiquitous neurotransmitter receptors in Bilateria, with a small number of known prokaryotic homologues. Here we describe a new inventory and phylogenetic analysis of pLGIC genes across all kingdoms of life. Our main finding is a set of pLGIC genes in unicellular eukaryotes, some of which are metazoan-like Cys-loop receptors, and others devoid of Cys-loop cysteines, like their prokaryotic relatives. A number of such "Cys-less" receptors also appears in invertebrate metazoans. Together, those findings draw a new distribution of pLGICs in eukaryotes. A broader distribution of prokaryotic channels also emerges, including a major new archaeal taxon, Thaumarchaeota. More generally, pLGICs now appear nearly ubiquitous in major taxonomic groups except multicellular plants and fungi. However, pLGICs are sparsely present in unicellular taxa, suggesting a high rate of gene loss and a non-essential character, contrasting with their essential role as synaptic receptors of the bilaterian nervous system. Multiple alignments of these highly divergent sequences reveal a small number of conserved residues clustered at the interface between the extracellular and transmembrane domains. Only the "Cys-loop" proline is absolutely conserved, suggesting the more fitting name "Pro loop" for that motif, and "Pro-loop receptors" for the superfamily. The infered molecular phylogeny shows a Cys-loop and a Cys-less clade in eukaryotes, both containing metazoans and unicellular members. This suggests new hypotheses on the evolutionary history of the superfamily, such as a possible origin of the Cys-loop cysteines in an ancient unicellular eukaryote. Deeper phylogenetic relationships remain uncertain, particularly around the split between bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes.},

abstract = {Using the crosstalk between the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and its lipid microenvironment as a paradigm, this short overview analyzes the occurrence of structural motifs which appear not only to be conserved within the nAChR family and contemporary eukaryotic members of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC) superfamily, but also extend to prokaryotic homologues found in bacteria. The evolutionarily conserved design is manifested in: 1) the concentric three-ring architecture of the transmembrane region, 2) the occurrence in this region of distinct lipid consensus motifs in prokaryotic and eukaryotic pLGIC and 3) the key participation of the outer TM4 ring in conveying the influence of the lipid membrane environment to the middle TM1-TM3 ring and this, in turn, to the inner TM2 channel-lining ring, which determines the ion selectivity of the channel. The preservation of these constant structural-functional features throughout such a long phylogenetic span likely points to the successful gain-of-function conferred by their early acquisition.

abstract = {Certain types of nonpsychoactive cannabinoids can potentiate glycine receptors (GlyRs), an important target for nociceptive regulation at the spinal level. However, little is known about the potential and mechanism of glycinergic cannabinoids for chronic pain treatment. We report that systemic and intrathecal administration of cannabidiol (CBD), a major nonpsychoactive component of marijuana, and its modified derivatives significantly suppress chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain without causing apparent analgesic tolerance in rodents. The cannabinoids significantly potentiate glycine currents in dorsal horn neurons in rat spinal cord slices. The analgesic potency of 11 structurally similar cannabinoids is positively correlated with cannabinoid potentiation of the $\alpha$3 GlyRs. In contrast, the cannabinoid analgesia is neither correlated with their binding affinity for CB1 and CB2 receptors nor with their psychoactive side effects. NMR analysis reveals a direct interaction between CBD and S296 in the third transmembrane domain of purified $\alpha$3 GlyR. The cannabinoid-induced analgesic effect is absent in mice lacking the $\alpha$3 GlyRs. Our findings suggest that the $\alpha$3 GlyRs mediate glycinergic cannabinoid-induced suppression of chronic pain. These cannabinoids may represent a novel class of therapeutic agents for the treatment of chronic pain and other diseases involving GlyR dysfunction.},

abstract = {Serotonin type 3 (5-HT(3)) receptors are pentameric ion channels belonging to the superfamily of Cys-loop receptors. Receptor activation either leads to fast excitatory responses or modulation of neurotransmitter release depending on their neuronal localisation. 5-HT(3) receptors are known to be expressed in the central nervous system in regions involved in the vomiting reflex, processing of pain, the reward system, cognition and anxiety control. In the periphery they are present on a variety of neurons and immune cells. 5-HT(3) receptors are known to be involved in emesis, pain disorders, drug addiction, psychiatric and GI disorders. Progress in molecular genetics gives direction to personalised medical strategies for treating complex diseases such as psychiatric and functional GI disorders and unravelling individual drug responses in pharmacogenetic approaches. Here we discuss the molecular basis of 5-HT(3) receptor diversity at the DNA and protein level, of which our knowledge has greatly extended in the last decade. We also evaluate their role in health and disease and describe specific case-control studies addressing the involvement of polymorphisms of 5-HT3 subunit genes in complex disorders and responses to drugs. Furthermore, we focus on the actual state of the pharmacological knowledge concerning not only classical 5-HT(3) antagonists--the setrons--but also compounds of various substance classes targeting 5-HT(3) receptors such as anaesthetics, opioids, cannabinoids, steroids, antidepressants and antipsychotics as well as natural compounds derived from plants. This shall point to alternative treatment options modulating the 5-HT(3) receptor system and open new possibilities for drug development in the future.},

  abstract = {Epidemiological studies have identified a negative correlation between smoking and the development of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, and in some studies, Alzheimer's disease. These findings have been attributed to the ability of nicotine to act as a neuroprotective agent. A large number of studies demonstrate that nicotine can protect against neuronal death in vitro and in vivo, and the mechanisms underlying the ability of nicotine to protect against excitotoxicity and amyloid-? toxicity are beginning to be elucidated. Despite the compelling evidence that nicotine is neuroprotective, it is clear that nicotine can be toxic under some circumstances. The balance between nicotine neuroprotection and toxicity depends on dose, developmental stage and regimen of administration. Therefore, a full understanding of the molecular and cellular effects of nicotine on signaling pathways relevant to neuronal survival is critical for informed drug discovery of nicotinic compounds to combat human neurodegeneration. This review summarizes recent studies related to the mechanisms underlying nicotine-mediated neuroprotection, and addresses issues that are relevant to use of nicotine as a neuroprotective agent in vivo.},

abstract = {The squid has been the most studied cephalopod, and it has served as a very useful model for investigating the events associated with nerve impulse generation and synaptic transmission. While the physiology of squid giant axons has been extensively studied, very little is known about the distribution and function of the neurotransmitters and receptors that mediate inhibitory transmission at the synapses. In this study we investigated whether $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activates neurotransmitter receptors in stellate ganglia membranes. To overcome the low abundance of GABA-like mRNAs in invertebrates and the low expression of GABA in cephalopods, we used a two-electrode voltage clamp technique to determine if Xenopus laevis oocytes injected with cell membranes from squid stellate ganglia responded to GABA. Using this method, membrane patches containing proteins and ion channels from the squid's stellate ganglion were incorporated into the surface of oocytes. We demonstrated that GABA activates membrane receptors in cellular membranes isolated from squid stellate ganglia. Using the same approach, we were able to record native glutamate-evoked currents. The squid's GABA receptors showed an EC(50) of 98 $\mu$mol l(-1) to GABA and were inhibited by zinc (IC(50) = 356 $\mu$mol l(-1)). Interestingly, GABA receptors from the squid were only partially blocked by bicuculline. These results indicate that the microtransplantation of native cell membranes is useful to identify and characterize scarce membrane proteins. Moreover, our data also support the role of GABA as an ionotropic neurotransmitter in cephalopods, acting through chloride-permeable membrane receptors.},

abstract = {In the present research, we have established a new lipidomics approach for the comprehensive and precise identification of molecular species in a crude lipid mixture using a LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer (MS) and reverse-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) combination with our newly developed lipid search engine " Lipid Search" LTQ Orbitrap provides high mass accuracy MS spectra by Fourier-transform (FT) mass spectrometer mode and can perform rapid MSn by ion trap (IT) mass spectrometer mode. In this study, the negative ion mode was selected to detect fragment ions from phospholipids, such as fatty acid anions, by MS2 or MS3. We selected the specific detection approach by neutral loss survey-dependent MS3, for the identification of molecular species of phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin and phosphatidylserine. Identification of molecular species was performed by using both the high mass accuracy of the mass spectrometric data obtained from FT mode and structural data obtained from fragments in IT mode. Some alkylacyl and alkenylacyl species have the same m/z value as molecular-related ions and fragment ions, thus, direct acid hydrolysis analysis was performed to identify alkylacyl and alkenylacyl species, and then the RPLC-LTQ Orbitrap method was applied. As a result, 290 species from mouse liver and 248 species from mouse brain were identified within six different classes of phospholipid, only those in manually detected and confirmed. Most of all manually detected mass peaks were also automatically detected by " Lipid Search" Adding to differences in molecular species in different classes of phospholipids, many characteristic differences in molecular species were detected in mouse liver and brain. More variable number of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid-containing molecular species were detected in mouse brain than liver. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Inflammation and altered polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) levels have been implicated in bipolar disorder (BD). A recent genome-wide association study identified a locus in the fatty acid desaturase (FADS) gene cluster conferring susceptibility to BD. In this study, we examined PUFA levels in patients with BD in relation to proinflammatory cytokines, FADS genotype, and dietary habits. We enrolled 83 patients with BD and 217 healthy controls who underwent plasma PUFA measurement. A subsample of 65 patients and 90 controls underwent plasma interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF$\alpha$) measurement, and three FADS single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped. Information on fish consumption was obtained by a self-reported diet history questionnaire. In comparing PUFA levels between patients and controls, significant differences were found for all 7 PUFAs tested. Specifically, n-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) level was decreased, and n-6 arachidonic acid level was increased in the patients (p {\textless} 0.0001 for both). Plasma IL-6 and TNF$\alpha$ levels were both significantly increased in the patients. Plasma EPA level was negatively correlated with IL-6 and TNF$\alpha$ levels. The FADS genotype, which was associated with increased n-6 PUFA levels, was also associated with marked elevation in TNF$\alpha$ levels. Less frequent fish intake was associated with low EPA and high IL-6 level. Taken together, our results provide strong evidence for altered plasma PUFA and proinflammatory cytokine levels in patients with BD. Furthermore, FADS genotype and fish consumption may contribute not only to altered PUFA levels but also to inflammation in BD.},

abstract = {Various types of lipids and their metabolic products associated with the biological membrane play a crucial role in signal transduction, modulation, and activation of receptors and as precursors of bioactive lipid mediators. Dysfunction in the lipid homeostasis in the brain could be a risk factor for the many types of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These neurodegenerative disorders are marked by extensive neuronal apoptosis, gliosis, and alteration in the differentiation, proliferation, and development of neurons. Sphingomyelin, a constituent of plasma membrane, as well as its primary metabolite ceramide acts as a potential lipid second messenger molecule linked with the modulation of various cellular signaling pathways. Excessive production of reactive oxygen species associated with enhanced oxidative stress has been implicated with these molecules and involved in the regulation of a variety of different neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders. Studies have shown that alterations in the levels of plasma lipid/cholesterol concentration may result to neurodegenerative diseases. Alteration in the levels of inflammatory cytokines and mediators in the brain has also been found to be implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. Although several mechanisms involved in neuronal apoptosis have been described, the molecular mechanisms underlying the correlation between lipid metabolism and the neurological deficits are not clearly understood. In the present review, an attempt has been made to provide detailed information about the association of lipids in neurodegeneration especially in Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {The metabolic syndrome is a cluster of pathological conditions, including hypertension, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, obesity and low HDL levels that is of great concern worldwide, as individuals with metabolic syndrome have an increased risk of type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Insulin resistance, the key feature of the metabolic syndrome, might be at the same time cause and consequence of impaired lipid composition in plasma membranes of insulin-sensitive tissues like liver, muscle and adipose tissue. Diet intervention has been proposed as a powerful tool to prevent the development of the metabolic syndrome, since healthy diets have been shown to have a protective role against the components of the metabolic syndrome. Particularly, dietary fatty acids are capable of modulating the deleterious effects of these conditions, among other mechanisms, by modifications of the lipid composition of the membranes in insulin-sensitive tissues. However, there is still scarce data based of high-level evidence on the effects of dietary oils on the effects of the metabolic syndrome and its components. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the effects of dietary oils on improving alterations of the components of the metabolic syndrome. It also examines their influence in the modulation of plasma membrane lipid composition and in the functionality of membrane proteins involved in insulin activity, like the insulin receptor, GLUT-4, CD36/FAT and ABCA-1, and their effect in the metabolism of glucose, fatty acids and cholesterol, and, in turn, the key features of the metabolic syndrome.

abstract = {The risk of schizophrenia is increased in offspring whose mothers experience malnutrition during pregnancy. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are dietary components that are crucial for the structural and functional integrity of neural cells, and PUFA deficiency has been shown to be a risk factor for schizophrenia. Here, we show that gestational and early postnatal dietary deprivation of two PUFAs - arachidonic acid (AA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) - elicited schizophrenia-like phenotypes in mouse offspring at adulthood. In the PUFA-deprived mouse group, we observed lower motivation and higher sensitivity to a hallucinogenic drug resembling the prodromal symptoms in schizophrenia. Furthermore, a working-memory task-evoked hyper-neuronal activity in the medial prefrontal cortex was also observed, along with the downregulation of genes in the prefrontal cortex involved in oligodendrocyte integrity and the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic system. Regulation of these genes was mediated by the nuclear receptor genes Rxr and Ppar, whose promoters were hyper-methylated by the deprivation of dietary AA and DHA. In addition, the RXR agonist bexarotene upregulated oligodendrocyte- and GABA-related gene expression and suppressed the sensitivity of mice to the hallucinogenic drug. Notably, the expression of these nuclear receptor genes were also downregulated in hair-follicle cells from schizophrenia patients. These results suggest that PUFA deficiency during the early neurodevelopmental period in mice could model the prodromal state of schizophrenia through changes in the epigenetic regulation of nuclear receptor genes.},

Here, we assign a key role for atypical C1 domains in mediating DAG fatty acyl specificity of diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) in live cells. Activity-based proteomics mapped C1 probe binding as a principal differentiator of type 1 DGK active sites that combined with global metabolomics revealed a role for C1s in lipid substrate recognition. Protein engineering by C1 domain swapping demonstrated that exchange of typical and atypical C1s is functionally tolerated and can directly program DAG fatty acyl specificity of type 1 DGKs. Collectively, we describe a protein engineering strategy for studying metabolic specificity of lipid kinases to assign a role for atypical C1 domains in cell metabolism.},

abstract = {Rationale: The non-selective nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist nicotine has been argued to improve attention via enhanced filtering of irrelevant stimuli. Here, we tested this hypothesis in the context of smooth pursuit eye movements (SPEMs), an oculomotor function previously shown to improve with nicotine in some but not all studies. Objectives: In order to test whether nicotine improves performance particularly when the inhibition of distracting stimuli is required, SPEM was elicited in conditions with or without peripheral distractors. Additionally, different target frequencies were employed in order to parametrically vary general processing demands on the SPEM system. Methods: Healthy adult non-smokers (N = 18 females, N = 13 males) completed a horizontal sinusoidal SPEM task at different target frequencies (0.2 Hz, 0.4 Hz, 0.6 Hz) in the presence or absence of peripheral distractors in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design using a 2 mg nicotine gum. Results: Nicotine increased peak pursuit gain relative to placebo (p {\textless}.001), but an interaction with distractor condition (p =.001) indicated that this effect was most pronounced in the presence of distractors. Catch-up saccade frequency was reduced by nicotine (p =.01), particularly at higher target frequencies (two-way interaction, p =.04). However, a three-way interaction (p =.006) indicated that the reduction with nicotine was strongest at the highest target frequency (0.6 Hz) only without distractors, whereas in the presence of distractors, it was strongest at 0.4-Hz target frequency. There were no effects of nicotine on subjective state measures. Conclusions: Together, these findings support a role of both distractor inhibition and general processing load in the effects of nicotine on smooth pursuit.},

No effective therapy for preventing or arresting the neurologic regression in the disease in its various clinical presentations is available. Based on our prior evidence of enhanced O.S. and lipid peroxidation in RTT patients, herein we tested the possible therapeutic effects of $\omega$-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ($\omega$-3 PUFAs), known antioxidants with multiple effects, on the clinical symptoms and O.S. biomarkers in the earliest stage of RTT. A total of 20 patients in stage I were randomized (n = 10 subjects per arm) to either oral supplementation with $\omega$-3 PUFAs-containing fish oil (DHA: 72.9 ± 8.1 mg/ kg b.w./day; EPA: 117.1 ± 13.1 mg/kg b.w./day; total $\omega$-3 PUFAs: 246.0 ± 27.5 mg/kg b.w./day) for 6 months or no treatment. Primary outcomes were potential changes in clinical symptoms, with secondary outcomes including variations for five O.S. markers in plasma and/or erythrocytes (nonprotein bound iron, F2-dihomo-isoprostanes, F3-isoprostanes, F4-neuroprostanes, and F2-isoprostanes). A significant reduction in the clinical severity (in particular, motor-related signs, nonverbal communication deficits, and breathing abnormalities) together with a significant decrease in all the examined O.S. markers was observed in the $\omega$-3 PUFAs supplemented patients, whereas no significant changes were evidenced in the untreated group.

As a consequence, therapies based on the regulation of membrane lipid composition and structure have been recently developed. This novel field, known as Membrane Lipid Therapy, is growing and evolving rapidly, providing treatments that are now in use or that are being studied for their application to oncological disorders, Alzheimer's disease, spinal cord injury, stroke, diabetes, obesity, and neuropathic pain. This field has arisen from relevant discoveries on the behavior of membranes in recent decades, and it paves the way to adopt new approaches in modern pharmacology and nutrition. This innovative area will promote further investigation into membranes and the development of new therapies with molecules that target the cell membrane. Due to the prominent roles of membranes in the cells' physiology and the paucity of therapeutic approaches based on the regulation of the lipids they contain, it is expected that membrane lipid therapy will provide new treatments for numerous pathologies. The first on-purpose rationally designed molecule in this field, minerval, is currently being tested in clinical trials and it is expected to enter the market around 2020.

Phospholipases A2 (PLA2) are key-enzymes in AA metabolism and are activated during monoaminergic neurotransmission. Reduced membrane AA levels, and an altered activity of PLA2 have been found in peripheral membranes of drug-na{\"{i}}ve patients with schizophrenia with some conflicting results in more chronic patient populations. Furthermore, in vivo brain phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy suggests reduced lipid membrane precursors (phosphomonoesters) and increased membrane breakdown products (phosphodiesters) in drug-naive or early treated first-episode schizophrenia patients compared to age-matched controls or chronic populations and these changes were correlated with peripheral red blood cell membrane AA levels. We postulate that processes modulating membrane lipid metabolism are associated with psychotic illnesses and might partially explain the mechanism of action of antipsychotic agents, as well as experimental agents such as purified ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid (E-EPA). Recent supplementation trials suggest that E-EPA is a modestly effective augmentation treatment resulting in reduced doses of antipsychotic medication in acutely ill patients with schizophrenia (but not in residual-type schizophrenia).

Little data exist from treatment-naive patients making it difficult to differentiate any genetic contribution associated with a diagnosis of schizophrenia from the lifestyle risks associated with this diagnosis. Additional potential risks associated with antipsychotic drug treatment have been noted in the literature since 1971. The majority of the existing data on lipids derive from retrospective and cross-sectional analyses of datasets that have been designed for other purposes. Specifically screening bias for lipid testing and treatment selection bias are important potential confounders. Prospective clinical trials are difficult to interpret, as many are short-term, report on non-fasting data and were never designed to evaluate the differential effects of antipsychotic drugs on lipids as a primary endpoint. There is little reported data on lipid fractions such as LDL and HDL. Nevertheless there is some evidence from placebo-controlled studies that antipsychotics may be differentially associated with a small, clinically insignificant increase in cholesterol and a larger, potentially clinically significant increase in triglycerides. Further prospective randomized trials, using fasting data and controlling for established risk factors such as diet and exercise are essential to determine if there are clinically meaningful differential effects on lipids associated with individual antipsychotic drugs. {\textcopyright} 2005 British Association for Psychopharmacology.},

In this review we discuss some paradigmatic cases of neurotransmitter receptor-lipid interactions, highlighting the chemical nature of the intervening lipid species and providing examples of the receptor mechanisms affected by interaction with lipids. The focus is on the effects of cholesterol, glycerophospholipids and covalent fatty acid acylation on neurotransmitter receptors. We also briefly discuss the role of lipid phase states involving lateral heterogeneities of the host membrane known to modulate membrane transport, protein sorting and signaling. Modulation of neurotransmitter receptors by lipids occurs at multiple levels, affecting a wide span of activities including their trafficking, sorting, stability, residence lifetime at the cell surface, endocytosis, and recycling, among other important functional properties at the synapse.},

abstract = {Lipids not only constitute the primary component of cellular membranes and contribute to metabolism but also serve as intracellular signaling molecules and bind to specific membrane receptors to control cell proliferation, growth and convey neuroprotection. Over the last several decades, the development of new analytical techniques, such as imaging mass spectrometry (IMS), has contributed to our understanding of their involvement in physiological and pathological conditions. IMS allows researchers to obtain a wide range of information about the spatial distribution and abundance of the different lipid molecules that is crucial to understand brain functions. The primary aim of this study was to map the spatial distribution of different lipid species in the rat central nervous system (CNS) using IMS to find a possible relationship between anatomical localization and physiology. The data obtained were subsequently applied to a model of neurological disease, the 192IgG-saporin lesion model of memory impairment. The results were obtained using a LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer in positive and negative ionization modes and analyzed by ImageQuest and MSIReader software. A total of 176 different molecules were recorded based on the specific localization of their intensities. However, only 34 lipid species in negative mode and 51 in positive were assigned to known molecules with an error of 5 ppm. These molecules were grouped by different lipid families, resulting in: Phosphatidylcholines (PC): PC (34: 1) + K+ and PC (32: 0) + K+ distributed primarily in gray matter, and PC (36: 1) + K+ and PC (38: 1) + Na+ distributed in white matter.

abstract = {Disorders of muscle lipid metabolism may involve intramyocellular triglyceride degradation, carnitine uptake, long-chain fatty acids mitochondrial transport, or fatty acid $\beta$-oxidation. Three main diseases leading to permanent muscle weakness are associated with severe increased muscle lipid content (lipid storage myopathies): primary carnitine deficiency, neutral lipid storage disease and multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. A moderate lipidosis may be observed in fatty acid oxidation disorders revealed by rhabdomyolysis episodes such as carnitine palmitoyl transferase II, very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiencies, and in recently described phosphatidic acid phosphatase deficiency. Respiratory chain disorders and congenital myasthenic syndromes may also be misdiagnosed as fatty acid oxidation disorders due to the presence of secondary muscle lipidosis. The main biochemical tests giving clues for the diagnosis of these various disorders are measurements of blood carnitine and acylcarnitines, urinary organic acid profile, and search for intracytoplasmic lipid on peripheral blood smear (Jordan's anomaly). Genetic analysis orientated by the results of biochemical investigation allows establishing a firm diagnosis. Primary carnitine deficiency and multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency may be treated after supplementation with carnitine, riboflavine and coenzyme Q10. New therapeutic approaches for fatty acid oxidation disorders are currently developed, based on pharmacological treatment with bezafibrate, and specific diets enriched in medium-chain triglycerides or triheptanoin. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Membrane lipid composition varies greatly within submembrane compartments, different organelle membranes, and also between cells of different cell stage, cell and tissue types, and organisms. Environmental factors (such as diet) also influence membrane composition. The membrane lipid composition is tightly regulated by the cell, maintaining a homeostasis that, if disrupted, can impair cell function and lead to disease. This is especially pronounced in the brain, where defects in lipid regulation are linked to various neurological diseases. The tightly regulated diversity raises questions on how complex changes in composition affect overall bilayer properties, dynamics, and lipid organization of cellular membranes. Here, we utilize recent advances in computational power and molecular dynamics force fields to develop and test a realistically complex human brain plasma membrane (PM) lipid model and extend previous work on an idealized, “average” mammalian PM. The PMs showed both striking similarities, despite significantly different lipid composition, and interesting differences. The main differences in composition (higher cholesterol concentration and increased tail unsaturation in brain PM) appear to have opposite, yet complementary, influences on many bilayer properties. Both mixtures exhibit a range of dynamic lipid lateral inhomogeneities (“domains”). The domains can be small and transient or larger and more persistent and can correlate between the leaflets depending on lipid mixture, Brain or Average, as well as on the extent of bilayer undulations.},

Our plasma membrane model consists of 63 different lipid species, combining 14 types of headgroups and 11 types of tails asymmetrically distributed across the two leaflets, closely mimicking an idealized mammalian plasma membrane. We observe an enrichment of cholesterol in the outer leaflet and a general non-ideal lateral mixing of the different lipid species. Transient domains with liquid-ordered character form and disappear on the microsecond time scale. These domains are coupled across the two membrane leaflets.

abstract = {The glycine receptor is a member of the Cys-loop receptor superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels and is implicated as a possible therapeutic target for the treatment of diseases such as alcoholism and inflammatory pain. In humans, four glycine receptor subtypes ($\alpha$1, $\alpha$2, $\alpha$3, and $\beta$) co-assemble to form pentameric channel proteins as either $\alpha$ homomers or $\alpha$$\beta$ heteromers. To date, few agents have been identified that can selectively modulate the glycine receptor, especially those possessing subtype specificity. We used a cell-based method of phage display panning, coupled with two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology in Xenopus laevis oocytes, to identify novel heptapeptide modulators of the $\alpha$1$\beta$ glycine receptor. This involved a panning procedure in which the phage library initially underwent subtractive panning against Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293 cells expressing alternative glycine receptor subtypes before panning the remaining library over HEK 293 cells expressing the target, the $\alpha$1$\beta$ glycine receptor. Peptides were identified that act with selectivity on $\alpha$1$\beta$ and $\alpha$3$\beta$, compared to $\alpha$2$\beta$, glycine receptors. In addition, peptide activity at the glycine receptor decreased when zinc was chelated by tricine, similar to previous observations of a decrease in ethanol's enhancing actions at the receptor in the absence of zinc. Comparisons of the amino acid sequences of heptapeptides capable of potentiating glycine receptor function revealed several consensus sequences that may be predictive of a peptide's enhancing ability.},

abstract = {We have used optical tweezers to study the elasticity of red cell membranes; force was applied to a bead attached to a permeabilized spherical ghost and the force-extension relation was obtained from the response of a second bead bound at a diametrically opposite position. Interruption of the skeletal network by dissociation of spectrin tetramers or extraction of the actin junctions engendered a fourfold reduction in stiffness at low applied force, but only a twofold change at larger extensions. Proteolytic scission of the ankyrin, which links the membrane skeleton to the integral membrane protein, band 3, induced a similar effect. The modified, unlike the native membranes, showed plastic relaxation under a prolonged stretch. Flaccid giant liposomes showed no measurable elasticity. Our observations indicate that the elastic character is at least as much a consequence of the attachment of spectrin as of a continuous membrane-bound network, and they offer a rationale for formation of elliptocytes in genetic conditions associated with membrane-skeletal perturbations. The theory of Parker and Winlove for elastic deformation of axisymmetric shells (accompanying paper) allows us to determine the function BH2for the spherical saponin-permeabilized ghost membranes (where B is the bending modulus and H the shear modulus); taking the literature value of 2 x 10-19Nm for B, H then emerges as 2 x 10-6Nm-1. This is an order of magnitude higher than the value reported for intact cells from micropipette aspiration. Reasons for the difference are discussed.},

The isotherm study revealed an attractive interaction between oleic acid and DPPC. The incorporation of oleic acid also monotonically decreased the elastic modulus of the monolayer indicative of higher fluidity with increasing oleic acid content. Using the surface force apparatus, intermembrane force–distance profiles were obtained for substrate supported DPPC membranes containing 30mol{\%} oleic acid at pH5.8 and 7.4. Three different preparation conditions resulted in distinct force profiles. Membranes prepared in pH5.8 subphase had a low number of nanoscopic defects ≤1{\%} and an adhesion magnitude of {\~{}}0.6mN/m. A slightly higher defect density of 1–4{\%} was found for membranes prepared in a physiological pH7.4 subphase. The presence of the exposed hydrophobic moieties resulted in a higher adhesion magnitude of 2.9mN/m. Importantly, at pH7.4, some oleic acid deprotonates resulting in a long-range electrostatic repulsion. Even though oleic acid increased the DPPC bilayer fluidity and the number of defects, no membrane restructuring was observed indicating that the system maintained a stable configuration.},

These findings have been attributed to the ability of nicotine to act as a neuroprotective agent. A large number of studies demonstrate that nicotine can protect against neuronal death in vitro and in vivo, and the mechanisms underlying the ability of nicotine to protect against excitotoxicity and amyloid-? toxicity are beginning to be elucidated. Despite the compelling evidence that nicotine is neuroprotective, it is clear that nicotine can be toxic under some circumstances. The balance between nicotine neuroprotection and toxicity depends on dose, developmental stage and regimen of administration. Therefore, a full understanding of the molecular and cellular effects of nicotine on signaling pathways relevant to neuronal survival is critical for informed drug discovery of nicotinic compounds to combat human neurodegeneration. This review summarizes recent studies related to the mechanisms underlying nicotine-mediated neuroprotection, and addresses issues that are relevant to use of nicotine as a neuroprotective agent in vivo.},

abstract = {Emerging evidence indicates that hypnotic anesthetics affect immune function. Many anesthetics potentiate $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid A receptor (GABAAR) activation, and these receptors are expressed on multiple subtypes of immune cells, providing a potential mechanistic link. Like immune cells, airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells also express GABAARs, particularly isoforms containing $\alpha$4 subunits, and activation of these receptors leads to ASM relaxation. We sought to determine if GABAAR signaling modulates the ASM contractile and inflammatory phenotype of a murine allergic asthma model utilizing GABAAR $\alpha$4 subunit global knockout (KO; Gabra4(0/0)) mice. Wild type (WT) and Gabra4 KO mice were sensitized with house dust mite (HDM) antigen or exposed to phosphate buffered saline (PBS) intranasally 5 days/week for 3 weeks. Ex vivo tracheal rings from HDM-sensitized WT and Gabra4 KO mice exhibited similar magnitudes of acetylcholine-induced contractile force and isoproterenol-induced relaxation (p=n.s.; n=4). In contrast, in vivo airway resistance (flexiVent) was significantly increased in Gabra4 KO mice (p{\textless}0.05, n=8). Moreover, the Gabra4 KO mice demonstrated increased eosinophilic lung infiltration (p{\textless}0.05; n=4), and increased markers of lung T cell activation/memory (CD62L low, CD44 high; p{\textless}0.01, n=4). In vitro, Gabra4 KO CD4(+) cells produced increased cytokines and exhibited increased proliferation after stimulation of the T cell receptor as compared to WT CD4(+) cells. These data suggest that the GABAAR $\alpha$4 subunit plays a role in immune cell function during allergic lung sensitization. Thus, GABAAR $\alpha$4 subunit-specific agonists have the therapeutic potential to treat asthma via two mechanisms: direct ASM relaxation and inhibition of airway inflammation.},

abstract = {Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (n ACh Rs) are members of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel superfamily that play important roles in the control of neurotransmitter release in the central and peripheral nervous system. These receptors are important therapeutic targets for the development of drugs against a number of mental health disorders and for marketed smoking cessation aids. Unfortunately, drug discovery has been hampered by difficulties in obtaining sufficiently selective compounds. Together with functional complexity of the receptors, this has made it difficult to obtain drugs with sufficiently high-target to off-target affinity ratios. The recent and ongoing progress in structural studies holds promise to help understand structure-function relationships of n ACh R drugs at the atomic level. This will undoubtedly lead to the design of more efficient drugs with fewer side effects. As a high-resolution structure of a n ACh R is yet to be determined, structural studies are to a large extent based on acetylcholine-binding proteins ( ACh BPs) that despite low overall sequence identity display a high degree of conservation of overall structure and amino acids at the ligand-binding site. Further, ACh BPs reproduce relative binding affinities of ligands at n ACh Rs. Over the past decade, ACh BPs have been used extensively as models for n ACh Rs and have aided the understanding of drug receptor interactions at n ACh Rs significantly. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {BACKGROUND $\alpha$7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are widely distributed throughout the central nervous system and are reported to have neuroprotective properties. $\alpha$7 nAChRs are expressed on astrocytes, which are key regulators of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in several neurodegenerative diseases. However, the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of astroglial $\alpha$7 nAChRs are not well studied. Therefore, we evaluated the role of astroglial $\alpha$7 nAChR activation in neuroinflammation. METHODS Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of $\alpha$7 nAChR activation were evaluated in an in vitro mouse model of neuroinflammation using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in primary astrocyte cultures. $\alpha$7 nAChR anti-inflammatory effects on the NF-$\kappa$B pathway were evaluated using ELISA, gene expression analysis, immunofluorescence, and western blotting. Antioxidant effect of $\alpha$7 nAChR activation on expression profiles of canonical Nrf2 target genes was examined by quantitative PCR and western blotting. The role of the Nrf2 pathway in $\alpha$7 nAChR-mediated anti-inflammatory response was evaluated using Nrf2 knockout astrocytes. Brain ex vivo NF-$\kappa$B luciferase signals were evaluated after treatment with an $\alpha$7 nAChR agonist in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-injected NF-$\kappa$B luciferase reporter mouse model. RESULTS Astrocytes treated with the $\alpha$7 nAChR partial agonist (GTS21) showed significantly reduced LPS-mediated secretion of inflammatory cytokines and this effect was reversed by the $\alpha$7 nAChR antagonist methyllycaconitine (MLA) and by knockdown of $\alpha$7 nAChR expression with a short hairpin RNA. Further, $\alpha$7 nAChR activation blocked LPS-mediated NF-$\kappa$B nuclear translocation indicating that the observed anti-inflammatory effect may be mediated through inhibition of the NF-$\kappa$B pathway. Treatment with GTS21 also upregulated canonical Nrf2 antioxidant genes and proteins suggesting antioxidant properties of $\alpha$7 nAChR in astrocytes. Using an astrocyte conditioned media approach, we demonstrated reduction in neuronal apoptosis when astrocytes were pretreated with GTS21. Finally, in an in vivo neuroinflammation model using LPS in NF-$\kappa$B luciferase reporter mice, we demonstrated reduction in LPS-induced NF-$\kappa$B activity and pro-inflammatory cytokines with GTS21 treatment in brain tissue. CONCLUSION Our results suggest that activating astroglial $\alpha$7 nAChRs may have a role in neuroprotection by decreasing inflammation and oxidative stress, and therefore could have therapeutic implication for disease modifying treatments of neurodegenerative diseases.},

  abstract  = {Various types of lipids and their metabolic products associated with the biological membrane play a crucial role in signal transduction, modulation, and activation of receptors and as precursors of bioactive lipid mediators. Dysfunction in the lipid homeostasis in the brain could be a risk factor for the many types of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These neurodegenerative disorders are marked by extensive neuronal apoptosis, gliosis, and alteration in the differentiation, proliferation, and development of neurons. Sphingomyelin, a constituent of plasma membrane, as well as its primary metabolite ceramide acts as a potential lipid second messenger molecule linked with the modulation of various cellular signaling pathways. Excessive production of reactive oxygen species associated with enhanced oxidative stress has been implicated with these molecules and involved in the regulation of a variety of different neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders. Studies have shown that alterations in the levels of plasma lipid/cholesterol concentration may result to neurodegenerative diseases. Alteration in the levels of inflammatory cytokines and mediators in the brain has also been found to be implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. Although several mechanisms involved in neuronal apoptosis have been described, the molecular mechanisms underlying the correlation between lipid metabolism and the neurological deficits are not clearly understood. In the present review, an attempt has been made to provide detailed information about the association of lipids in neurodegeneration especially in Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {General anaesthetics have enjoyed long and widespread use but their molecular mechanism of action remains poorly understood. There is good evidence that their principal targets are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) such as inhibitory GABA(A) ($\gamma$-aminobutyric acid) receptors and excitatory nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which are respectively potentiated and inhibited by general anaesthetics. The bacterial homologue from Gloeobacter violaceus (GLIC), whose X-ray structure was recently solved, is also sensitive to clinical concentrations of general anaesthetics. Here we describe the crystal structures of the complexes propofol/GLIC and desflurane/GLIC. These reveal a common general-anaesthetic binding site, which pre-exists in the apo-structure in the upper part of the transmembrane domain of each protomer. Both molecules establish van der Waals interactions with the protein; propofol binds at the entrance of the cavity whereas the smaller, more flexible, desflurane binds deeper inside. Mutations of some amino acids lining the binding site profoundly alter the ionic response of GLIC to protons, and affect its general-anaesthetic pharmacology. Molecular dynamics simulations, performed on the wild type (WT) and two GLIC mutants, highlight differences in mobility of propofol in its binding site and help to explain these effects. These data provide a novel structural framework for the design of general anaesthetics and of allosteric modulators of brain pLGICs.},

abstract = {Our molecular simulations reveal that wild-type influenza fusion peptides are able to stabilize a highly fusogenic pre-fusion structure, i.e. a peptide bundle formed by four or more trans-membrane arranged fusion peptides. We rationalize that the lipid rim around such bundle has a non-vanishing rim energy (line-tension), which is essential to (i) stabilize the initial contact point between the fusing bilayers, i.e. the stalk, and (ii) drive its subsequent evolution. Such line-tension controlled fusion event does not proceed along the hypothesized standard stalk-hemifusion pathway. In modeled influenza fusion, single point mutations in the influenza fusion peptide either completely inhibit fusion (mutants G1V and W14A) or, intriguingly, specifically arrest fusion at a hemifusion state (mutant G1S). Our simulations demonstrate that, within a line-tension controlled fusion mechanism, these known point mutations either completely inhibit fusion by impairing the peptide's ability to stabilize the required peptide bundle (G1V and W14A) or stabilize a persistent bundle that leads to a kinetically trapped hemifusion state (G1S). In addition, our results further suggest that the recently discovered leaky fusion mutant G13A, which is known to facilitate a pronounced leakage of the target membrane prior to lipid mixing, reduces the membrane integrity by forming a 'super' bundle. Our simulations offer a new interpretation for a number of experimentally observed features of the fusion reaction mediated by the prototypical fusion protein, influenza hemagglutinin, and might bring new insights into mechanisms of other viral fusion reactions.},

abstract = {Model calculations were performed to explore quantitative aspects of the discocyte-echinocyte shape transformation in red blood cells. The shape transformation was assumed to be driven by changes in the preferred curvature of the membrane bilayer and opposed by the elastic shear rigidity of the membrane skeleton. The energy required for echinocyte bump formation was calculated for a range of bump shapes for different preferred curvatures. Energy minima corresponding to nonzero bump heights were found when the stress-free area difference between the membrane leaflets or the spontaneous curvature of the membrane became sufficiently large, but the calculations predict that the membrane can tolerate significant differences in the resting areas of the inner and outer leaflets or significant spontaneous curvature without visible changes in shape. Thus, if the cell is near the threshold for bump formation, the calculations predict that small changes in membrane properties would produce large changes in cellular geometry. These results provide a rational framework for interpreting observations of shape transformations in red cells and for understanding the mechanism by which small changes in membrane elastic properties might lead to significant changes in geometry.},

abstract = {The maintenance of optimal cognitive function is a central feature of healthy aging. Impairment in brain glucose uptake is common in aging associated cognitive deterioration, but little is known of how this problem arises or whether it can be corrected or bypassed. Several aspects of the challenge to providing the brain with an adequate supply of fuel during aging seem to relate to omega-3 fatty acids. For instance, low intake of omega-3 fatty acids, especially docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is becoming increasingly associated with several forms of cognitive decline in the elderly, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Brain DHA level seems to be an important regulator of brain glucose uptake, possibly by affecting the activity of some but not all the glucose transporters. DHA synthesis from either $\alpha$-linolenic acid (ALA) or eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is very low in humans begging the question of whether these DHA precursors are likely to be helpful in maintaining cognition during aging. We speculate that ALA and EPA may well have useful supporting roles in maintaining brain function during aging but not by their conversion to DHA. ALA is an efficient ketogenic fatty acid, while EPA promotes fatty acid oxidation. By helping to produce ketone bodies, the effects of ALA and EPA could well be useful in strategies intended to use ketones to bypass problems of impaired glucose access to the brain during aging. Hence, it may be time to consider whether the main omega-3 fatty acids have distinct but complementary roles in brain function. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Certain types of nonpsychoactive cannabinoids can potentiate glycine receptors (GlyRs), an important target for nociceptive regulation at the spinal level. However, little is known about the potential and mechanism of glycinergic cannabinoids for chronic pain treatment. We report that systemic and intrathecal administration of cannabidiol (CBD), a major nonpsychoactive component of marijuana, and its modified derivatives significantly suppress chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain without causing apparent analgesic tolerance in rodents. The cannabinoids significantly potentiate glycine currents in dorsal horn neurons in rat spinal cord slices. The analgesic potency of 11 structurally similar cannabinoids is positively correlated with cannabinoid potentiation of the $\alpha$3 GlyRs. In contrast, the cannabinoid analgesia is neither correlated with their binding affinity for CB1 and CB2 receptors nor with their psychoactive side effects. NMR analysis reveals a direct interaction between CBD and S296 in the third transmembrane domain of purified $\alpha$3 GlyR. The cannabinoid-induced analgesic effect is absent in mice lacking the $\alpha$3 GlyRs. Our findings suggest that the $\alpha$3 GlyRs mediate glycinergic cannabinoid-induced suppression of chronic pain. These cannabinoids may represent a novel class of therapeutic agents for the treatment of chronic pain and other diseases involving GlyR dysfunction.},

Here we show a novel computational framework to simulate the healing of wounds that brings together knowledge from continuum mechanics, growth and remodeling, and systems biology regulatory networks. At the tissue scale we consider a field of displacements that satisfies linear momentum balance, and continuous fields for cells and chemical signal concentrations which obey reaction–diffusion equations. At the cell scale a set of ordinary differential equations describe the dynamics of remodeling. Our major contribution is the modeling and simulation of the coupling of cellular and chemical fields to tissue-level mechanics via local changes in fiber alignment, dispersion, collagen content, permanent area change, elastic deformation, and active contraction. Numerically, the constitutive equations for remodeling are solved at the integration points while the displacements and biological fields are solved monolithically with a finite element formulation. The method presented here is at the junction of applied mechanics and systems biology, two exciting fields that continue to approach each other as we seek to unravel the basic principles of mechanical adaptation in living materials with the aid of computational simulations.},

abstract = {The accretion of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in membranes of the central nervous system is required for the optimum development of retina and brain functions. DHA status is determined by the dietary intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), both the metabolic precursor $\alpha$-linolenic acid ($\alpha$-LNA) and DHA. Clinical studies have shown that feeding term or premature infants with formula low in total n-3 PUFA may alter the maturation of visual acuity. Moreover, feeding infants over the first 6 mon of life with formula containing adequate $\alpha$-LNA, but no DHA, did not sustain the same cerebral accretion of DHA as that of breast-fed infants. Whether lower DHA accretion in brain of formula-fed term infants impairs neurophysiological performances is not clearly established. Contradictory data have been published, possibly owing to confounding factors such as maternal intakes and/or genetic variations in PUFA metabolism. Nevertheless, a large corpus of data is in favor of the recommendation of regular dietary intakes of DHA (during at least the first 6 mon of life) and suggest that DHA should be added in formulas at the level generally found in human milk (0.2-0.3 wt{\%} of total fatty acids). The maternal intake of n-3 PUFA during pregnancy and lactation is also crucial, since the n-3 PUFA are provided during perinatal development through placental transfer and maternal milk, which determines the DHA status of the newborn and consequently impacts on post-natal development of brain and visual functions. Whether more clinical studies are needed to control and improve the impact of DHA maternal intakes on the progeny's neurodevelopment, several commissions recommended by precaution that DHA average intake for pregnant and lactating women should be of 200-300 mg/day. 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

abstract = {Background. Accumulation of free fatty acids leads to lipid-toxicity-associated skeletal muscle atrophy. Palmitate treatment reduces myoblast and myotube growth and causes apoptosis in vitro. It is not known if omega-3 fatty acids will protect muscle cells against palmitate toxicity. Therefore, we examined the effects of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on skeletal muscle growth. Methods. Mouse myoblasts (C 2 C 12) were differentiated to myotubes, and then treated with 0 or 0.5 mM palmitic acid or 0 or 0.1 mM DHA. Results. Intramyocellular lipid was increased in palmitate-treated cells but was prevented by DHA-palmitate cotreatment. Total AMPK increased in DHA+ palmitate-treated compared to palmitate only cells. RpS6 phosphorylation decreased after palmitate (−55{\%}) and this was blunted by DHA+ palmitate (−35{\%}) treatment. Palmitate treatment decreased PGC1$\alpha$ protein expression by 69{\%}, but was increased 165{\%} with DHA+ palmitate (P = 0.017) versus palmitate alone. While palmitate induced 25{\%} and 90{\%} atrophy in myotubes (after 48 hours and 96 hours, resp.), DHA+ palmitate treatment caused myotube hypertrophy of ∼50{\%} and 100{\%} after 48 and 96 hours, respectively. Conclusion. These data show that DHA is protective against palmitate-induced atrophy. Although DHA did not activate the AMPK pathway, DHA treatment restored growth-signaling (i.e., rpS6) and rescued palmitate-induced muscle atrophy.},

abstract = {$\alpha$-synuclein is a small protein abundantly expressed in the brain and located in synaptic terminals. The conversion of $\alpha$-synuclein into oligomers and fibrils is the hallmark of a range of neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. $\alpha$-synuclein is disordered in solution but can adopt an $\alpha$-helical conformation when bound to lipid membranes. This lipid-protein interaction plays an important role in its proposed biological function, i.e., synaptic plasticity, but can also entail the aggregation of the protein. Both the chemical properties of the lipids and the lipid-to-protein-ratio have been reported to modulate the aggregation propensity of $\alpha$-synuclein. In this review, the influence of changes in the nature and levels of lipids on the aggregation propensity of $\alpha$-synuclein in vivo and in vitro will be discussed within a common general framework. In particular, while biophysical measurements and kinetic analyses of the time courses of $\alpha$-synuclein aggregation in the presence of different types of lipid vesicles allow a mechanistic dissection of the influence of the lipids on $\alpha$-synuclein aggregation, biological studies of cellular and animal models of Parkinson's disease allow the determination of changes in lipid levels and properties associated with the disease.},

abstract = {Psychiatric disorders like mood disorders, schizophrenia, or drug addiction affect a sizeable proportion of the human population and severely compromise quality of life. Therefore, measures to prevent the manifestation, and treatments to ameliorate the symptoms, of these disorders are in high demand. Brain lipids determine the localization and function of proteins in the cell membrane of neurons. Lipids may also act as neurotransmitters or other signalling molecules. The lipid composition of the brain can be influenced by nutrition, environmental factors, and by behavioural activity. Thus, lipids represent a target for preventive medicine of psychiatric disorders. Here we review how brain lipids contribute to normal behaviour and to major psychiatric disorders with the focus on phospholipids/fatty acids, sphingolipids, and endocannabinoids. Accumulating evidence suggests a crucial role for membrane forming and signalling lipids in the brain in the etiopathologies of depression, bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, and drug addiction. Lipids also represent potential preventive interventions for these psychiatric disorders by either targeted dietary supplementation or pharmacological manipulation of lipid regulating enzymes.},

abstract = {Fatty acid differences, including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) have been shown in the brains of Alzheimer's patients (AD) as compared with normal age-matched individuals. Furthermore, low serum DHA is a significant risk factor for the development of AD. The relative concentration of DHA and other fatty acids, however, in the plasma of AD patients compared with patients with other kinds of dementias (other dementias; OD), patients who are cognitively impaired but nondemented (CIND), or normal patients is not known. In this study we analyzed the total phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) fractions of plasma from patients diagnosed with AD, OD, or CIND and compared them with a group of elderly control subjects with normal cognitive functioning. Plasma phospholipid and PC levels of 20:5n-3, DHA, total n-3 fatty acids, and the n-3/n-6 ratio were lower in the AD, OD, and CIND groups. Plasma phospholipid 24:0 was lower in the AD, OD, and CIND groups as compared with the group of control patients, and total n-6 fatty acid levels were higher in the AD and CIND groups only. In the plasma PE fraction, levels of 20:5n-3, DHA, and the total n-3 fatty acid levels were significantly lower in the AD, OD, and CIND groups. DHA levels were lower in the lysoPC fraction of CIND individuals only. There were no other differences in the fatty acid compositions of the different phospholipid fractions. Therefore, in AD, OD, and CIND individuals, low levels of n-3 fatty acids in the plasma may be a risk factor for cognitive impairment and/or dementia. Interestingly, a decreased level of plasma DHA was not limited to the AD patients but appears to be common in cognitive impairment with aging},

Cell mechanics is becoming an important issue and could serves as a potential indicator for early cancer diagnosis. In this study, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was applied to characterize and compare the surface nanostructure and viscoelasticity of different breast cell lines. Our results show that breast cancerous cells MCF-7 exhibit more disorganized filamentous cytoskeleton structure with increased membrane roughness compared to benign breast cells MCF-10A (P {\textless} 0.05). The viscoelastic properties, including elasticity and viscosity, are significantly different between the two cell lines. MCF-7 displays reduced elasticity and viscosity, indicating that breast cancer cells are softer and more fluid than benign counterpart. Our findings provide new insights into the biophysical changes of cells during tumor transformation and suggest it could be used for early cancer detection at single cell level.

abstract = {Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) are rare neurodegenerative diseases sharing the degeneration of the corticospinal tracts as the main pathological characteristic. They are considered one of the most heterogeneous neurological disorders. All modes of inheritance have been described for the 84 different loci and 67 known causative genes implicated up to now. Recent advances in molecular genetics have revealed clinico-genetic heterogeneity of these disorders including their clinical and genetic overlap with other diseases of the nervous system. The systematic analysis of a large set of genes, including exome sequencing, is unmasking unusual phenotypes or inheritance modes associated with mutations in HSP genes and related genes involved in various neurological diseases. A new nosology may emerge after integration and understanding of these new data to replace the current classification. Collectively, functions of the known genes implicate the disturbance of intracellular membrane dynamics and trafficking as the consequence of alterations of cytoskeletal dynamics, lipid metabolism and organelle structures, which represent in fact a relatively small number of cellular processes that could help to find common curative approaches, which are still lacking.},

abstract = {Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) in muscle fibers are densely packed in the postsynaptic region at the neuromuscular junction. Rapsyn plays a central role in directing and clustering nAChR during cellular differentiation and neuromuscular junction formation; however, it has not been demonstrated whether rapsyn is the only cause of receptor immobilization. Here, we used single-molecule tracking methods to investigate nAChR mobility in plasma membranes of myoblast cells during their differentiation to myotubes in the presence and absence of rapsyn. We found that in myoblasts the majority of nAChR were immobile and that ∼20{\%} of the receptors showed restricted diffusion in small domains of ∼50 nm. In myoblasts devoid of rapsyn, the fraction of mobile nAChR was considerably increased, accompanied by a 3-fold decrease in the immobile population of nAChR with respect to rapsyn-expressing cells. Half of the mobile receptors were confined to domains of ∼120 nm. Measurements performed in heterologously transfected HEK cells confirmed the direct immobilization of nAChR by rapsyn. However, irrespective of the presence of rapsyn, about one-third of nAChR were confined in 300-nm domains. Our results show (i) that rapsyn efficiently immobilizes nAChR independently of other postsynaptic scaffold components; (ii) nAChR is constrained in confined membrane domains independently of rapsyn; and (iii) in the presence of rapsyn, the size of these domains is strongly reduced.},

abstract = {Lipids play important roles in cellular dysfunction leading to disease. Although a major role for phospholipids is in defining the membrane permeability barrier, phospholipids play a central role in a diverse range of cellular processes and therefore are important factors in cellular dysfunction and disease. This review is focused on the role of phospholipids in normal assembly and organization of the membrane proteins, multimeric protein complexes, and higher order supercomplexes. Since lipids have no catalytic activity, it is difficult to determine their function at the molecular level. Lipid function has generally been defined by affects on protein function or cellular processes. Molecular details derived from genetic, biochemical, and structural approaches are presented for involvement of phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin in protein organization. Experimental evidence is presented that changes in phosphatidylethanolamine levels results in misfolding and topological misorientation of membrane proteins leading to dysfunctional proteins. Examples are presented for diseases in which proper protein folding or topological organization is not attained due to either demonstrated or proposed involvement of a lipid. Similar changes in cardiolipin levels affects the structure and function of individual components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and their organization into supercomplexes resulting in reduced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation efficiency and apoptosis. Diseases in which mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to reduced cardiolipin levels are described. Therefore, understanding the principles governing lipid-dependent assembly and organization of membrane proteins and protein complexes will be useful in developing novel therapeutic approaches for disorders in which lipids play an important role.},

abstract = {Serotonin type 3 (5-HT(3)) receptors are pentameric ion channels belonging to the superfamily of Cys-loop receptors. Receptor activation either leads to fast excitatory responses or modulation of neurotransmitter release depending on their neuronal localisation. 5-HT(3) receptors are known to be expressed in the central nervous system in regions involved in the vomiting reflex, processing of pain, the reward system, cognition and anxiety control. In the periphery they are present on a variety of neurons and immune cells. 5-HT(3) receptors are known to be involved in emesis, pain disorders, drug addiction, psychiatric and GI disorders. Progress in molecular genetics gives direction to personalised medical strategies for treating complex diseases such as psychiatric and functional GI disorders and unravelling individual drug responses in pharmacogenetic approaches. Here we discuss the molecular basis of 5-HT(3) receptor diversity at the DNA and protein level, of which our knowledge has greatly extended in the last decade. We also evaluate their role in health and disease and describe specific case-control studies addressing the involvement of polymorphisms of 5-HT3 subunit genes in complex disorders and responses to drugs. Furthermore, we focus on the actual state of the pharmacological knowledge concerning not only classical 5-HT(3) antagonists--the setrons--but also compounds of various substance classes targeting 5-HT(3) receptors such as anaesthetics, opioids, cannabinoids, steroids, antidepressants and antipsychotics as well as natural compounds derived from plants. This shall point to alternative treatment options modulating the 5-HT(3) receptor system and open new possibilities for drug development in the future.},

Metabolic profiling is therefore particularly indicated for the study of central nervous system by probing metabolic and neurochemical profiles of the healthy or diseased brain, in preclinical models or in human samples. In this review, we introduce the analytical and statistical requirements for metabolic profiling. Then, we focus on key studies in the field of metabolic profiling applied to the characterization of animal models and human samples of central nervous system disorders. We highlight the potential of metabolic profiling for pharmacological and physiological evaluation, diagnosis and drug therapy monitoring of patients affected by brain disorders. Finally, we discuss the current challenges in the field, including the development of systems biology and pharmacology strategies improving our understanding of metabolic signatures and mechanisms of central nervous system diseases.},

abstract = {The glycine receptor is a member of the Cys-loop receptor superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels and is implicated as a possible therapeutic target for the treatment of diseases such as alcoholism and inflammatory pain. In humans, four glycine receptor subtypes ($\alpha$1, $\alpha$2, $\alpha$3, and $\beta$) co-assemble to form pentameric channel proteins as either $\alpha$ homomers or $\alpha$$\beta$ heteromers. To date, few agents have been identified that can selectively modulate the glycine receptor, especially those possessing subtype specificity. We used a cell-based method of phage display panning, coupled with two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology in Xenopus laevis oocytes, to identify novel heptapeptide modulators of the $\alpha$1$\beta$ glycine receptor. This involved a panning procedure in which the phage library initially underwent subtractive panning against Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293 cells expressing alternative glycine receptor subtypes before panning the remaining library over HEK 293 cells expressing the target, the $\alpha$1$\beta$ glycine receptor. Peptides were identified that act with selectivity on $\alpha$1$\beta$ and $\alpha$3$\beta$, compared to $\alpha$2$\beta$, glycine receptors. In addition, peptide activity at the glycine receptor decreased when zinc was chelated by tricine, similar to previous observations of a decrease in ethanol's enhancing actions at the receptor in the absence of zinc. Comparisons of the amino acid sequences of heptapeptides capable of potentiating glycine receptor function revealed several consensus sequences that may be predictive of a peptide's enhancing ability.},

abstract = {In the central nervous system, deficits in cholinergic neurotransmission correlate with decreased attention and cognitive impairment, while stimulation of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors improves attention, cognitive performance and neuronal resistance to injury as well as produces robust analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. The rational basis for the therapeutic use of orthosteric agonists and positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of nicotinic receptors arises from the finding that functional nicotinic receptors are ubiquitously expressed in neuronal and non-neuronal tissues including brain regions highly vulnerable to traumatic and ischemic types of injury (e.g., cortex and hippocampus). Moreover, functional nicotinic receptors do not vanish in age-, disease- and trauma-related neuropathologies, but their expression and/or activation levels decline in a subunit- and brain region-specific manner. Therefore, augmenting the endogenous cholinergic tone by nicotinic agents is possible and may offset neurological impairments associated with cholinergic hypofunction. Importantly, because neuronal damage elevates extracellular levels of choline (a selective agonist of $\alpha$7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors) near the site of injury, $\alpha$7-PAM-based treatments may augment pathology-activated $\alpha$7-dependent auto-therapies where and when they are most needed (i.e., in the penumbra, post-injury). Thus, nicotinic-PAM-based treatments are expected to augment the endogenous cholinergic tone in a spatially and temporally restricted manner creating the potential for differential efficacy and improved safety as compared to exogenous orthosteric nicotinic agonists that activate nicotinic receptors indiscriminately. In this review, I will summarize the existing trends in therapeutic applications of nicotinic PAMs. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

As a result of research during the past several decades, a group of ligand-gated ion channels have emerged as plausible targets for general anesthetics. Molecular biology techniques have greatly accelerated attempts to classify ligand-gated ion channel sensitivity to general anesthetics, and have identified the sites of receptor subunits critical for anesthetic modulation using chimeric and mutated receptors. The experimental data have facilitated the construction of tenable molecular models for anesthetic binding sites, which in turn allows structural predictions to be tested. In vivo significance of a putative anesthetic target can now be examined by targeted gene manipulations in mice.

abstract = {The nicotinic-like ligand-gated ion channel superfamily consists of a group of structurally related receptors that activate an ion channel after the binding of extracellular ligand. The recent publications of the crystal structure of an acetylcholine binding protein and a refined electron micrograph structure of the membrane-bound segment of an acetylcholine receptor have led to insights into the molecular determinants of receptor function. Although the structures confirmed much biochemical and electrophysiological data obtained about the receptors, they also provide opportunities to study further the mechanisms that allow channel activation stimulated by ligand-binding. Here we review the mechanisms of channel gating that have been elucidated by information gained from the structures of the acetylcholine binding protein and membrane-bound segment of the acetylcholine receptor.},

abstract = {Standard treatment of poisoning by organophosphorus (OP) nerve agents with atropine and oximes lacks efficacy with different nerve agents. A direct pharmacologic intervention at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) was proposed as an alternative therapeutic approach and promising in vitro and in vivo results were obtained with the bispyridinium compound SAD-128. In addition, a number of SAD-128 analogues improved neuromuscular transmission of soman-poisoned diaphragms in vitro. We investigated the interaction of six of these SAD-128 analogues with the orthosteric binding site of the human $\alpha$7 nAChR and Torpedo californica nAChR with a high-throughput assay using radioactive ligands. The determined affinity constants indicate a weak interaction of three test compounds (Ki in the micromolar range) with both receptors, but no interaction could be recorded with the other three test compounds. The six SAD-128 analogues showed a low intrinsic inhibitory potency with human acetylcholinesterase (IC50{\textgreater}400$\mu$M). In conclusion, the results of the present study do not indicate a correlation between the affinity to the orthosteric binding site and the functional improvement of neuromuscular transmission and it is assumed that other mechanisms contribute to the therapeutic effect of the tested compounds. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {Epidemiological studies have identified a negative correlation between smoking and the development of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, and in some studies, Alzheimer's disease. These findings have been attributed to the ability of nicotine to act as a neuroprotective agent. A large number of studies demonstrate that nicotine can protect against neuronal death in vitro and in vivo, and the mechanisms underlying the ability of nicotine to protect against excitotoxicity and amyloid-? toxicity are beginning to be elucidated. Despite the compelling evidence that nicotine is neuroprotective, it is clear that nicotine can be toxic under some circumstances. The balance between nicotine neuroprotection and toxicity depends on dose, developmental stage and regimen of administration. Therefore, a full understanding of the molecular and cellular effects of nicotine on signaling pathways relevant to neuronal survival is critical for informed drug discovery of nicotinic compounds to combat human neurodegeneration. This review summarizes recent studies related to the mechanisms underlying nicotine-mediated neuroprotection, and addresses issues that are relevant to use of nicotine as a neuroprotective agent in vivo.},

Lipids influence nicotinic receptor function by allosteric mechanisms, stabilizing varying proportions of pre-existing resting, open, desensitized, and uncoupled conformations. Recent structures reveal that lipids could alter function by modulating transmembrane $\alpha$-helix/$\alpha$-helix packing, which in turn could alter the conformation of the allosteric interface that links the agonist-binding and transmembrane pore domains-this interface is essential in the coupling of agonist binding to channel gating. We discuss potential mechanisms by which lipids stabilize different conformational states in the context of the hypothesis that lipid-nicotinic receptor interactions modulate receptor function at biological synapses.},

abstract = {The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) is in intimate contact with the lipids in its native membrane. Here we analyze the possibility that it is the intrinsic properties of the AChR that determine its partition into a given lipid domain. Torpedo AChR or a synthetic peptide corresponding to the AChR M4 segment (the one in closer contact with lipids) was reconstituted into "raft"-containing model membranes. The distribution of the AChR was assessed by Triton X-100 extraction in combination with fluorescence studies, and lipid analyses were performed on each sample. The influence of rapsyn, a peripheral protein involved in AChR aggregation, was studied. Raft-like domain aggregation was also studied using membranes containing the ganglioside GM1 followed by GM1 crosslinking. The gammaM4 peptide displays a marked preference for raft-like domains. In contrast, AChR alone or in the presence of rapsyn or ganglioside aggregation exhibits no such preference for raft-like domains, but it does cause a significant reduction in the total amount of these domains. The results indicate that the distribution of the AChR in lipid domains cannot be due exclusively to the intrinsic physicochemical properties of the protein and that there must be an external signal in native cell membranes that directs the AChR to a specific membrane domain.},

Like immune cells, airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells also express GABAARs, particularly isoforms containing $\alpha$4 subunits, and activation of these receptors leads to ASM relaxation. We sought to determine if GABAAR signaling modulates the ASM contractile and inflammatory phenotype of a murine allergic asthma model utilizing GABAAR $\alpha$4 subunit global knockout (KO; Gabra4(0/0)) mice. Wild type (WT) and Gabra4 KO mice were sensitized with house dust mite (HDM) antigen or exposed to phosphate buffered saline (PBS) intranasally 5 days/week for 3 weeks. Ex vivo tracheal rings from HDM-sensitized WT and Gabra4 KO mice exhibited similar magnitudes of acetylcholine-induced contractile force and isoproterenol-induced relaxation (p=n.s.; n=4). In contrast, in vivo airway resistance (flexiVent) was significantly increased in Gabra4 KO mice (p{\textless}0.05, n=8). Moreover, the Gabra4 KO mice demonstrated increased eosinophilic lung infiltration (p{\textless}0.05; n=4), and increased markers of lung T cell activation/memory (CD62L low, CD44 high; p{\textless}0.01, n=4). In vitro, Gabra4 KO CD4(+) cells produced increased cytokines and exhibited increased proliferation after stimulation of the T cell receptor as compared to WT CD4(+) cells.

Thus, GABAAR $\alpha$4 subunit-specific agonists have the therapeutic potential to treat asthma via two mechanisms: direct ASM relaxation and inhibition of airway inflammation.},

abstract = {Different nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes are implicated in learning, pain sensation, and disease states, including Parkinson disease and nicotine addiction. alpha-Conotoxins are among the most selective nAChR ligands. Mechanistic insights into the structure, function, and receptor interaction of alpha-conotoxins may serve as a platform for development of new therapies. Previously characterized alpha-conotoxins have a highly conserved Ser-Xaa-Pro motif that is crucial for potent nAChR interaction. This study characterized the novel alpha-conotoxin LtIA, which lacks this highly conserved motif but potently blocked alpha3beta2 nAChRs with a 9.8 nm IC(50) value. The off-rate of LtIA was rapid relative to Ser-Xaa-Pro-containing alpha-conotoxin MII. Nevertheless, pre-block of alpha3beta2 nAChRs with LtIA prevented the slowly reversible block associated with MII, suggesting overlap in their binding sites. nAChR beta subunit ligand-binding interface mutations were used to examine the {\textgreater}1000-fold selectivity difference of LtIA for alpha3beta2 versus alpha3beta4 nAChRs. Unlike MII, LtIA had a {\textgreater}900-fold increased IC(50) value on alpha3beta2(F119Q) versus wild type nAChRs, whereas T59K and V111I beta2 mutants had little effect. Molecular docking simulations suggested that LtIA had a surprisingly shallow binding site on the alpha3beta2 nAChR that includes beta2 Lys-79. The K79A mutant disrupted LtIA binding but was without effect on an LtIA analog where the Ser-Xaa-Pro motif is present, consistent with distinct binding modes.},

abstract = {Site-directed mutagenesis was used to mutate alpha Cys418 and beta Cys447 in the M4 domain of Torpedo californica acetylcholine receptor expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The M4 region is a transmembrane domain thought to be located at the lipid-protein interface. By whole-cell voltage clamp analysis, mutation of both alpha subunits to alpha Trp418 increased maximal channel activity approximately threefold, increased the desensitization rate compared with wild-type receptor, and shifted the EC50 for acetylcholine from 32 microM to 13 microM. Patch measurements of single-channel currents revealed that the alpha Trp418 increased channel open times approximately 28-fold at 13 degrees C with no effect on channel conductance. All of our measured functional changes in the alpha Trp418 mutant are consistent with a simple kinetic model of the acetylcholine receptor in which only the channel closing rate is altered by the mutation. Our results show that changes in protein structure at the putative lipid-protein interface can dramatically affect receptor function. {\textcopyright} 1994, The Biophysical Society.

abstract = {Calcium-permeable neurotransmitter receptors are concentrated into structurally and biochemically isolated cellular compartments to localize calcium-mediated events during neuro-transmission. The cytoplasmic membrane contains lipid microdomains called lipid rafts, which can gather into microscopically visible clusters, and thus the association of a particular protein with lipid rafts can result in its redistribution on the cell surface. The present study asks whether lipid rafts participate in the formation and maintenance of the calcium-permeable 7-subunit nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (7nAChR) clusters found in somatic spines of ciliary neurons. Lipid rafts and 7nAChR become progressively colocalized within somatic spines during synaptogenesis. To determine whether these rafts are required for the maintenance of 7nAChR aggregates, cholesterol was extracted from dissociated ciliary neurons by treatment with methyl-cyclodextrin. This treatment caused the dispersion of lipid rafts and the redistribution of 7nAChR into small clusters over the cell surface, suggesting that the integrity of lipid rafts is required to maintain the receptor clustering. However, lipid raft dispersion also caused the depolymerization of the F-actin cytoskeleton, which can also tether the receptor at specific sites. To assess whether interaction between rafts and 7nAChR is independent of F-actin filaments, the lipid raft patches were stabilized with a combination of the cholera toxin B subunit (CTX), which specifically binds to the raft component ganglioside GM1, and an antibody against CTX. The stabilized rafts were then treated with latrunculin-A to depolymerize F-actin. Under these conditions , large patches of CTX persisted and were colocalized with 7nAChR, indicating that the aggregates of receptors can be maintained independently of the underlying F-actin cytoskele-ton. Moreover, it was found that the 7nAChR is resistant to detergent extraction at 4°C and floats with the caveolin-containing lipid-rich fraction during density gradient centrifuga-tion, properties that are consistent with a direct association between the receptor and the membrane microdomains.},

abstract = {abstract: Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to study the secondary structure of purified Torpedo californica nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) in reconstituted membranes. Functional studies have previously demonstrated that the ion channel activity requires the presence of both sterol and negatively charged phospholipids in membranes. The present studies are designed to test the hypothesis that the «-helical structure of AChR may be stabilized by specific lipid molecules (sterol and/or negatively charged phospholipids) and that these «-helices may be responsible for the formation of a potential ion channel. FTIR data show statistically significant (p {\textless} 0.005) spectral changes due to cholesterol and negatively charged phospholipids, respectively. On the basis of standard curves describing the relationship between the spectral properties and the secondary structural contents of water-soluble proteins, the observed spectral change at 931 cm " 1 can be interpreted as an apparent change in the «-helix content from about 17{\%} in the absence of sterols to about 20{\%} in the presence of sterols, suggesting that protein-sterol interactions increase the helical structure of the AChR molecule. Similarly, the spectral change at 988 cm " 1 can be interpreted as an apparent increase of /3-sheet content in the AChR molecule from about 20{\%} to about 24{\%} due to the presence of negatively charged phospholipids. Functional AChR in membranes thus appears to be correlated with higher «-helical and /3-sheet contents. It is concluded that one role of specific interactions between membrane protein and lipid molecules may be to maintain specific secondary structures necessary to support the ion channel function of AChR.},

The topological relationship between protein and lipid moieties and the changes in physical properties induced by exogenous lipids are discussed next. This background information lays the basis for understanding the occurrence of lipid sites in the AChR transmembrane region, and the selectivity of the protein-lipid interactions. Changes in FRET efficiency induced by fatty acids, phospholipid and cholesterol (Chol), led to the identification of discrete sites for these lipids on the AChR protein, and electron-spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy has recently facilitated determination of the stoichiometry and selectivity for the AChR of the shell lipid. The influence of lipids on AChR function is discussed next. Combined single-channel and site-directed mutagenesis data fostered the recognition of lipid-sensitive residues in the transmembrane region, dissecting their contribution to ligand binding and channel gating, opening and closing. Experimental evidence supports the notion that the interface between the protein moiety and the adjacent lipid shell is the locus of a variety of pharmacologically relevant processes, including the action of steroids and other lipids. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) constitute a widespread class of ion channels, present in archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes. Upon binding of their agonists in the extracellular domain, the transmembrane pore opens, allowing ions to go through, via a gating mechanism that can be modulated by a number of drugs. Even though high-resolution structural information on pLGICs has increased in a spectacular way in recent years, both in bacterial and in eukaryotic systems, the structure of the open channel conformation of some intensively studied receptors whose structures are known in a nonactive (closed) form, such as Erwinia chrysanthemi pLGIC (ELIC), is still lacking. Here we describe a gammaproteobacterial pLGIC from an endo-symbiont of Tevnia jerichonana (sTeLIC), whose sequence is closely related to the pLGIC from ELIC with 28{\%} identity. We provide an X-ray crystallographic structure at 2.3 {\AA} in an active conformation, where the pore is found to be more open than any current conformation found for pLGICs. In addition, two charged restriction rings are present in the vestibule. Functional characterization shows sTeLIC to be a cationic channel activated at alkaline pH. It is inhibited by divalent cations, but not by quaternary ammonium ions, such as tetramethylammonium. Additionally, we found that sTeLIC is allosterically potentiated by aromatic amino acids Phe and Trp, as well as their derivatives, such as 4-bromo-cinnamate, whose cocrystal structure reveals a vestibular binding site equivalent to, but more deeply buried than, the one already described for benzodiazepines in ELIC.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND $\alpha$7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are widely distributed throughout the central nervous system and are reported to have neuroprotective properties. $\alpha$7 nAChRs are expressed on astrocytes, which are key regulators of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in several neurodegenerative diseases. However, the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of astroglial $\alpha$7 nAChRs are not well studied. Therefore, we evaluated the role of astroglial $\alpha$7 nAChR activation in neuroinflammation. METHODS Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of $\alpha$7 nAChR activation were evaluated in an in vitro mouse model of neuroinflammation using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in primary astrocyte cultures. $\alpha$7 nAChR anti-inflammatory effects on the NF-$\kappa$B pathway were evaluated using ELISA, gene expression analysis, immunofluorescence, and western blotting. Antioxidant effect of $\alpha$7 nAChR activation on expression profiles of canonical Nrf2 target genes was examined by quantitative PCR and western blotting. The role of the Nrf2 pathway in $\alpha$7 nAChR-mediated anti-inflammatory response was evaluated using Nrf2 knockout astrocytes. Brain ex vivo NF-$\kappa$B luciferase signals were evaluated after treatment with an $\alpha$7 nAChR agonist in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-injected NF-$\kappa$B luciferase reporter mouse model. RESULTS Astrocytes treated with the $\alpha$7 nAChR partial agonist (GTS21) showed significantly reduced LPS-mediated secretion of inflammatory cytokines and this effect was reversed by the $\alpha$7 nAChR antagonist methyllycaconitine (MLA) and by knockdown of $\alpha$7 nAChR expression with a short hairpin RNA. Further, $\alpha$7 nAChR activation blocked LPS-mediated NF-$\kappa$B nuclear translocation indicating that the observed anti-inflammatory effect may be mediated through inhibition of the NF-$\kappa$B pathway. Treatment with GTS21 also upregulated canonical Nrf2 antioxidant genes and proteins suggesting antioxidant properties of $\alpha$7 nAChR in astrocytes. Using an astrocyte conditioned media approach, we demonstrated reduction in neuronal apoptosis when astrocytes were pretreated with GTS21. Finally, in an in vivo neuroinflammation model using LPS in NF-$\kappa$B luciferase reporter mice, we demonstrated reduction in LPS-induced NF-$\kappa$B activity and pro-inflammatory cytokines with GTS21 treatment in brain tissue. CONCLUSION Our results suggest that activating astroglial $\alpha$7 nAChRs may have a role in neuroprotection by decreasing inflammation and oxidative stress, and therefore could have therapeutic implication for disease modifying treatments of neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {Ethanol consumption produces a wide range of effects on the central nervous system, most of them related to changes in neural receptors. In vitro studies have demonstrated that ethanol increases neural nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nnAChR) affinity for ACh (Narahashi et al., 1991) and have also reported differences in sensitivity of nnAChRs for ethanol, depending on the subunit composition of the receptor (Cardoso et al., 1999). There is evidence that ethanol induces changes in density of nnAChRs in cellular cultures (Gorbounova et al., 1998). However, there are no clear results concerning the effects of chronic ethanol on nicotinic receptors and on behavior in rats nonselected by their preference to ethanol. A number of studies demonstrate that nnAChRs participate in a variety of functions, including memory and learning processes, neurodegeneration, and neuroprotection (Picciotto et al., 2000). In the present work, we found significant alterations in the Fixed-Interval Behavioral Test, as well as in density and affinity parameters of hippocampal main subtypes of nnAChRs: alpha7 homopentamers and alpha4beta2 heteropentamers of ethanol-drinking rats nonselected by their preference to ethanol.},

abstract = {Ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs) constitute an important family of complex membrane proteins acting as receptors for neurotransmitters (Barnard, 1992; Ortells and Lunt, 1995). The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) from Torpedo is the most extensively studied member of the LGIC family and consists of a pentameric transmembrane glycoprotein composed of four different polypeptide subunits (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta) in a 2:1:1:1 stoichiometry (Galzi and Changeux, 1995; Hucho et al., 1996) that are arranged pseudosymmetrically around a central cation-selective ion channel. Conformational transitions, from the closed (nonconducting), to agonist-induced open (ion-conducting), to desensitized (nonconducting) states, are critical for functioning of the nAChR (Karlin, 2002). The ability of the nAChR to undergo these transitions is profoundly influenced by the lipid composition of the bilayer (Barrantes, 2004). Despite existing information on lipid dependence of AChR function, no satisfactory explanation has been given on the molecular events by which specific lipids exert such effects on the activity of an integral membrane protein. To date, several hypotheses have been entertained, including (1) indirect effects of lipids through the alteration of properties of the bilayer, such as fluidity (an optimal fluidity hypothesis [Fong and McNamee, 1986]) or membrane curvature and lateral pressure (Cantor, 1997; de Kruijff, 1997), or (2) direct effects through binding of lipids to defined sites on the transmembrane portion of the protein (Jones and McNamee, 1988; Blanton and Wang, 1990; Fernandez et al., 1993; Fernandez-Ballester et al., 1994), which has led to the postulation of a possible role of certain lipids as peculiar allosteric ligands of the protein. In this paper we have reconstituted purified AChRs from Torpedo into complex multicomponent lipid vesicles in which the phospholipid composition has been systematically altered. Stopped-flow rapid kinetics of cation translocation and Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy studies have been used to illustrate the lipid dependence of both AChR function and AChR secondary structure, respectively.},

abstract = {The effects of glycosylation and membrane environment on the structural stability of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) from Torpedo have been investigated to improve our understanding of factors that influence eukaryotic membrane protein crystallization. Gel shift assays and carbohydrate-specific staining show that the deglycosylation enzyme, Endo F1, removes at least 50{\%} of membrane-reconstituted nAChR glycosylation. The extent of deglycosylation with Endo F1 increases upon detergent solubilization. Removal of between 60-100{\%} of high mannose moieties from the nAChR has no effect on nAChR secondary structure, stability, or flexibility. Deglycosylation does not influence either agonist binding or the ability of the nAChR to undergo agonist-induced conformational change. In contrast, nAChR structural stability, flexibility, and function are all negatively influenced by simple changes in reconstituted membrane lipid composition. Our results suggest that deglycosylation may represent a feasible approach for enhancing the crystallizability of the nAChR. Our data also demonstrate that the dependence of nAChR structural stability on lipid environment may represent a significant obstacle to nAChR crystallization. Some membrane proteins may have evolved complex interactions with their lipid environments. Understanding the complexity of these interactions may be essential for devising an appropriate strategy for the crystallization of some membrane proteins. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Although general anesthetics are known to modulate the activity of ligand-gated ion channels in the Cys-loop superfamily, there is at present neither consensus on the underlying mechanisms, nor predictive models of this modulation. Viable models need to offer quantitative assessment of the relative importance of several identified anesthetic binding sites. However, to date, precise affinity data for individual sites has been challenging to obtain by biophysical means. Here, the likely role of pore block inhibition by the general anesthetics isoflurane and propofol of the prokaryotic pentameric channel GLIC is investigated by molecular simulations. Microscopic affinities are calculated for both single and double occupancy binding of isoflurane and propofol to the GLIC pore. Computations are carried out for an open-pore conformation in which the pore is restrained to crystallographic radius, and a closed-pore conformation that results from unrestrained molecular dynamics equilibration of the structure. The GLIC pore is predicted to be blocked at the micromolar concentrations for which inhibition by isofluorane and propofol is observed experimentally. Calculated affinities suggest that pore block by propofol occurs at signifcantly lower concentrations than those for which inhibition is observed: we argue that this discrepancy may result from binding of propofol to an allosteric site recently identified by X-ray crystallography, which may cause a competing gain-of-function effect. Affinities of isoflurane and propofol to the allosteric site are also calculated, and shown to be 3 mM for isoflurane and 10 $\mu$M for propofol; both anesthetics have a lower affinity for the allosteric site than for the unoccupied pore.},

abstract = {The Cys-loop receptor superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels has a prominent role in neuronal signalling. These receptors are pentamers, each subunit containing ten beta-strands in the extracellular domain and four alpha-helical transmembrane domains (M1-M4). The M2 domain of each subunit lines the intrinsic ion channel pore and residues within the extracellular domain form ligand binding sites. Ligand binding initiates a conformational change that opens the ion-selective pore. The coupling between ligand binding in the extracellular domain and opening of the intrinsic ion channel pore located in the membrane is not fully understood. Several loop structures, such as loop 2, the Cys-loop, the pre-M1 region and the M2-M3 loop have been implicated in receptor activation. The current "conformational change wave" hypothesis suggests that binding of a ligand initiates a rotation of the beta-sheets around an axis that passes through the Cys-loop. Due to this rotation, the Cys-loop and loop 2 are displaced. Movement of the M2-M3 loop then twists the M2 domain leading to a separation of the helices and opening of the pore. The publication of a crystal structure of an acetylcholine binding protein and the refined structure of the Torpedo marmorata acetylcholine receptor have improved the understanding of the mechanisms and structures involved in coupling ligand binding to channel gating. In this review, the most recent findings on some of these loop structures will be reported and discussed in view of their role in the gating mechanism.},

abstract = {Membrane lipids are potent modulators of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) from Torpedo. Lipids influence nAChR function by both conformational selection and kinetic mechanisms, stabilizing varying proportions of activatable versus non-activatable conformations, as well as influencing the transitions between these conformational States. Of note, some membranes stabilize an electrically silent uncoupled conformation that binds agonist but does not undergo agonist-induced conformational transitions. The uncoupled nAChR, however, does transition to activatable conformations in relatively thick lipid bilayers, such as those found in lipid rafts. In this review, we discuss current understanding of lipid-nAChR interactions in the context of increasingly available high resolution structural and functional data. These data highlight different sites of lipid action, including the lipid-exposed M4 transmembrane $\alpha$-helix. Current evidence suggests that lipids alter nAChR function by modulating interactions between M4 and the adjacent transmembrane $\alpha$-helices, M1 and M3. These interactions have also been implicated in both the folding and trafficking of nAChRs to the cell surface. We review current mechanistic understanding of lipid-nAChR interactions, and highlight potential biological roles for lipid-nAChR interactions in modulating the synaptic response.

abstract = {Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) are neurotransmitter-activated receptors that mediate fast synaptic transmission. In pLGICs, binding of agonist to the extracellular domain triggers a structural rearrangement that leads to the opening of an ion-conducting pore in the transmembrane domain and, in the continued presence of neurotransmitter, the channels desensitize (close). The flexible loops in each subunit that connect the extracellular binding domain (loops 2, 7, and 9) to the transmembrane channel domain (M2-M3 loop) are essential for coupling ligand binding to channel gating. Comparing the crystal structures of two bacterial pLGIC homologues, ELIC and the proton-activated GLIC, suggests channel gating is associated with rearrangements in these loops, but whether these motions accurately predict the motions in functional lipid-embedded pLGICs is unknown. Here, using site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and functional GLIC channels reconstituted into liposomes, we examined if, and how far, the loops at the ECD/TMD gating interface move during proton-dependent gating transitions from the resting to desensitized state. Loop 9 moves ∼9 {\AA} inward toward the channel lumen in response to proton-induced desensitization. Loop 9 motions were not observed when GLIC was in detergent micelles, suggesting detergent solubilization traps the protein in a nonactivatable state and lipids are required for functional gating transitions. Proton-induced desensitization immobilizes loop 2 with little change in position. Proton-induced motion of the M2-M3 loop was not observed, suggesting its conformation is nearly identical in closed and desensitized states. Our experimentally derived distance measurements of spin-labeled GLIC suggest ELIC is not a good model for the functional resting state of GLIC, and that the crystal structure of GLIC does not correspond to a desensitized state. These findings advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying pLGIC gating.},

abstract = {General anaesthetics have enjoyed long and widespread use but their molecular mechanism of action remains poorly understood. There is good evidence that their principal targets are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) such as inhibitory GABA(A) ($\gamma$-aminobutyric acid) receptors and excitatory nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which are respectively potentiated and inhibited by general anaesthetics. The bacterial homologue from Gloeobacter violaceus (GLIC), whose X-ray structure was recently solved, is also sensitive to clinical concentrations of general anaesthetics. Here we describe the crystal structures of the complexes propofol/GLIC and desflurane/GLIC. These reveal a common general-anaesthetic binding site, which pre-exists in the apo-structure in the upper part of the transmembrane domain of each protomer. Both molecules establish van der Waals interactions with the protein; propofol binds at the entrance of the cavity whereas the smaller, more flexible, desflurane binds deeper inside. Mutations of some amino acids lining the binding site profoundly alter the ionic response of GLIC to protons, and affect its general-anaesthetic pharmacology. Molecular dynamics simulations, performed on the wild type (WT) and two GLIC mutants, highlight differences in mobility of propofol in its binding site and help to explain these effects. These data provide a novel structural framework for the design of general anaesthetics and of allosteric modulators of brain pLGICs.},

In addition to the bilayer spectrum, the spin label reported a more motionally restricted environment whose contribution increased with increasing protein/lipid ratio. Exchange between thses two environments occurred at a rate of approx. 6 {\textperiodcentered} 107s-1. The motionally restricted, protein-associated 14-PCSL had a rotational correlation time of about 10-20 ns, an order of magnitude slower than when in the bilayer. Addition of 1-hexanol (up to 16 mM) to the reconstituted receptor perturbed the acyl chains of the bulk lipid phase, but the motional properties of the lipid acyl chains at the protein/lipid interface near the membrane center were not significantly perturbed on the EPR motional time-scale. Similarly, anesthetics that were less effective at perturbing the bilayer, such as pentobarbital (up to 2 mM) and isoflurane (7 mM), did not perturb the lipid/protein interface on the conventional EPR motional time scale. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {The objective of this review is to summarise the published evidence that supports the existence of amyopathic dermatomyositis (ADM) and its clinical significance including risk for rapidly progressive, fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD) and possible risk for internal malignancy. By establishing such inherent risks, we hope to establish the importance of formally recognising ADM as a subset of dermatomyositis (DM). Population-based epidemiologic studies have suggested that amyopathic DM might account for 20{\%} of the total population of dermatomyositis (DM) patients (1). Patients presenting with ADM have been reported by investigators of multiple nationalities to be at risk for rapidly progressive, potentially fatal ILD (2-5). In addition, a new autoantibody, anti-CADM-140, has been reported to be a risk factor for the development of interstitial lung disease in CADM patients (6-9). It has been argued that ADM patients may be at increased risk of developing internal malignancy compared to the general population, though its rate in comparison to classic DM (CDM) needs further study (1, 10-12). In our population, 41{\%} of CADM patients were previously classified as LE or UCTD. We conclude that ADM is a real entity that makes up a significant portion of the DM disease. It is important to formally recognise amyopathic DM as a subset of DM as it carries increased risk of ILD and possibly malignancy. Without appropriate disease classification, the opportunity for ILD and malignancy screening may be missed.},

abstract = {Cys-loop receptors constitute a superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs), including receptors for acetylcholine, serotonin, glycine and $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid. Several bacterial homologues have been identified that are excellent models for understanding allosteric binding of alcohols and anesthetics in human Cys-loop receptors. Recently, we showed that a single point mutation on a prokaryotic homologue (GLIC) could transform it from a channel weakly potentiated by ethanol into a highly ethanol-sensitive channel. Here, we have employed molecular simulations to study ethanol binding to GLIC, and to elucidate the role of the ethanol-enhancing mutation in GLIC modulation. By performing 1-µs simulations with and without ethanol on wild-type and mutated GLIC, we observed spontaneous binding in both intra-subunit and inter-subunit transmembrane cavities. In contrast to the glycine receptor GlyR, in which we previously observed ethanol binding primarily in an inter-subunit cavity, ethanol primarily occupied an intra-subunit cavity in wild-type GLIC. However, the highly ethanol-sensitive GLIC mutation significantly enhanced ethanol binding in the inter-subunit cavity. These results demonstrate dramatic effects of the F(14')A mutation on the distribution of ligands, and are consistent with a two-site model of pLGIC inhibition and potentiation.},

abstract = {Neurosteroids are endogenous sterols that potentiate or inhibit pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) and can be effective anesthetics, analgesics, or anti-epileptic drugs. The complex effects of neurosteroids on pLGICs suggest the presence of multiple binding sites in these receptors. Here, using a series of novel neurosteroid-photolabeling reagents combined with top-down and middle-down mass spectrometry, we have determined the stoichiometry, sites, and orientation of binding for 3$\alpha$,5$\alpha$-pregnane neurosteroids in the Gloeobacter ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC), a prototypic pLGIC. The neurosteroid-based reagents photolabeled two sites per GLIC subunit, both within the transmembrane domain; one site was an intrasubunit site, and the other was located in the interface between subunits. By using reagents with photoreactive groups positioned throughout the neurosteroid backbone, we precisely map the orientation of neurosteroid binding within each site. Amino acid substitutions introduced at either site altered neurosteroid modulation of GLIC channel activity, demonstrating the functional role of both sites. These results provide a detailed molecular model of multisite neurosteroid modulation of GLIC, which may be applicable to other mammalian pLGICs.},

They contribute to cognition, reward, mood and nociception, and are implicated in a range of neurological disorders. Previous measurements of whole-cell macroscopic currents showed that $\alpha$4 and $\beta$2 subunits assemble in two predominant pentameric stoichiometries, which differ in their sensitivity to agonists, antagonists and allosteric modulators. Here we compare agonist-elicited single channel currents from receptors assembled with an excess of either the $\alpha$4 or $\beta$2 subunit, forming receptor populations biased toward one or the other stoichiometry, with currents from receptors composed of five concatemeric subunits in which the subunit stoichiometry is predetermined. Our results associate each subunit stoichiometry with a unique single channel conductance, mean open channel lifetime and sensitivity to the allosteric potentiator NS-9283. Receptors with the composition ($\alpha$4$\beta$2)2$\alpha$4 exhibit high single channel conductance, brief mean open lifetime and strong potentiation by NS-9283, whereas receptors with the composition ($\alpha$4$\beta$2)2$\beta$2 exhibit low single channel conductance, long mean open lifetime and are not potentiated by NS-9283. Thus single channel current measurements reveal bases for the distinct functional and pharmacological properties endowed by different stoichiometries of $\alpha$4 and $\beta$2 subunits, and establish pentameric concatemers as a means to delineate interactions between subunits that confer these properties.},

abstract = {The acetylcholine receptor (AChR) from vertebrate skeletal muscle initiates voluntary movement, and its kinetics of activation are crucial for maintaining the safety margin for neuromuscular transmission. Furthermore, the kinetic mechanism of the muscle AChR serves as an archetype for understanding activation mechanisms of related receptors from the Cys-loop superfamily. Here we record currents through single muscle AChR channels with improved temporal resolution approaching half an order of magnitude over our previous best. A range of concentrations of full and partial agonists are used to elicit currents from human wild-type and gain-of-function mutant AChRs. For each agonist–receptor combination, rate constants are estimated from maximum likelihood analysis using a kinetic scheme comprised of agonist binding, priming, and channel gating steps. The kinetic scheme and rate constants are tested by stochastic simulation, followed by incorporation of the experimental step response, sampling rate, background noise, and filter bandwidth. Analyses of the simulated data confirm all rate constants except those for channel gating, which are overestimated because of the established effect of noise on the briefest dwell times. Estimates of the gating rate constants were obtained through iterative simulation followed by kinetic fitting. The results reveal that the agonist association rate constants are independent of agonist occupancy but depend on receptor state, whereas those for agonist dissociation depend on occupancy but not on state. The priming rate and equilibrium constants increase with successive agonist occupancy, and for a full agonist, the forward rate constant increases more than the equilibrium constant; for a partial agonist, the forward rate and equilibrium constants increase equally. The gating rate and equilibrium constants also increase with successive agonist occupancy, but unlike priming, the equilibrium constants increase more than the forward rate constants. As observed for a full and a partial agonist, the gain-of-function mutation affects the relationship between rate and equilibrium constants for priming but not for channel gating. Thus, resolving brief single channel currents distinguishes priming from gating steps and reveals how the corresponding rate and equilibrium constants depend on agonist occupancy.},

Here, we tested the hypothesis that these effects of $\beta$3 subunits would be preserved even if nAChR $\alpha$6 subunits harbored gain-of-function, leucine- or valine-to-serine mutations at 9' or 13' positions (L9'S or V13'S) in their second transmembrane domains, yielding receptors with heightened functional activity and more amenable to assessment of effects of $\beta$3 subunit incorporation. However, coexpression with $\beta$3 subunits potentiates rather than suppresses function of all-human, all-mouse, or hybrid $\alpha$6((L9'S or V13'S))$\beta$4*- or $\alpha$6(N143D+M145V)(L9'S)$\beta$2*-nAChR.

abstract = {Synapse efficacy heavily relies on the number of neurotransmitter receptors available at a given time. In addition to the equilibrium between the biosynthetic production, exocytic delivery and recycling of receptors on the one hand, and the endocytic internalization on the other, lateral diffusion and clustering of receptors at the cell membrane play key roles in determining the amount of active receptors at the synapse. Mobile receptors traffic between reservoir compartments and the synapse by thermally driven Brownian motion, and become immobilized at the peri-synaptic region or the synapse by: (a) clustering mediated by homotropic inter-molecular receptor-receptor associations; (b) heterotropic associations with non-receptor scaffolding proteins or the subjacent cytoskeletal meshwork, leading to diffusional "trapping," and (c) protein-lipid interactions, particularly with the neutral lipid cholesterol. This review assesses the contribution of some of these mechanisms to the supramolecular organization and dynamics of the paradigm neurotransmitter receptor of muscle and neuronal cells -the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). Currently available information stemming from various complementary biophysical techniques commonly used to interrogate the dynamics of cell-surface components is critically discussed. The translational mobility of nAChRs at the cell surface differs between muscle and neuronal receptors in terms of diffusion coefficients and residence intervals at the synapse, which cover an ample range of time regimes. A peculiar feature of brain $\alpha$7 nAChR is its ability to spend much of its time confined peri-synaptically, vicinal to glutamatergic (excitatory) and GABAergic (inhibitory) synapses. An important function of the $\alpha$7 nAChR may thus be visiting the territories of other neurotransmitter receptors, differentially regulating the dynamic equilibrium between excitation and inhibition, depending on its residence time in each domain.},

abstract = {Remarkable advances have been made toward the structural characterization of ion channels in the last two decades. However, the unambiguous assignment of well-defined functional states to the obtained structural models has proved challenging. In the case of the superfamily of nicotinic-receptor channels (also referred to as pentameric ligand-gated ion channels [pLGICs]), for example, two different types of model of the open-channel conformation have been proposed on the basis of structures solved to resolutions better than 4.0 {\AA}. At the level of the transmembrane pore, the open-state models of the proton-gated pLGIC from Gloeobacter violaceus (GLIC) and the invertebrate glutamate-gated Cl– channel (GluCl) are very similar to each other, but that of the glycine receptor (GlyR) is considerably wider. Indeed, the mean distances between the axis of ion permeation and the C$\alpha$ atoms at the narrowest constriction of the pore (position −2′) differ by ∼2 {\AA} in these two classes of model, a large difference when it comes to understanding the physicochemical bases of ion conduction and charge selectivity. Here, we take advantage of the extreme open-channel stabilizing effect of mutations at pore-facing position 9′. We find that the I9′A mutation slows down entry into desensitization of GLIC to the extent that macroscopic currents decay only slightly by the end of pH 4.5 solution applications to the extracellular side for several minutes. We crystallize (at pH 4.5) two variants of GLIC carrying this mutation and solve their structures to resolutions of 3.12 {\AA} and 3.36 {\AA}. Furthermore, we perform all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of ion permeation and picrotoxinin block, using the different open-channel structural models. On the basis of these results, we favor the notion that the open-channel structure of pLGICs from animals is much closer to that of the narrow models (of GLIC and GluCl) than it is to that of the GlyR.},

abstract = {The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is the prototypic member of the 'Cys-loop' superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels which mediate synaptic neurotransmission, and whose other members include receptors for glycine, gamma-aminobutyric acid and serotonin. Cryo-electron microscopy has yielded a three-dimensional structure of the nAChR in its closed state. However, the exact nature and location of the channel gate remains uncertain. Although the transmembrane pore is constricted close to its center, it is not completely occluded. Rather, the pore has a central hydrophobic zone of radius about 3 A. Model calculations suggest that such a constriction may form a hydrophobic gate, preventing movement of ions through a channel. We present a detailed and quantitative simulation study of the hydrophobic gating model of the nicotinic receptor, in order to fully evaluate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that the hydrophobic constriction of the nAChR pore indeed forms a closed gate. Potential of mean force (PMF) calculations reveal that the constriction presents a barrier of height about 10 kT to the permeation of sodium ions, placing an upper bound on the closed channel conductance of 0.3 pS. Thus, a 3 A radius hydrophobic pore can form a functional barrier to the permeation of a 1 A radius Na+ ion. Using a united-atom force field for the protein instead of an all-atom one retains the qualitative features but results in differing conductances, showing that the PMF is sensitive to the detailed molecular interactions.},

abstract = {Fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain is principally mediated by the neurotransmitter GABA ($\gamma$-aminobutyric acid) and its synaptic target, the type A GABA receptor (GABAA receptor). Dysfunction of this receptor results in neurological disorders and mental illnesses including epilepsy, anxiety and insomnia. The GABAA receptor is also a prolific target for therapeutic, illicit and recreational drugs, including benzodiazepines, barbiturates, anaesthetics and ethanol. Here we present high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures of the human $\alpha$1$\beta$2$\gamma$2 GABAA receptor, the predominant isoform in the adult brain, in complex with GABA and the benzodiazepine site antagonist flumazenil, the first-line clinical treatment for benzodiazepine overdose. The receptor architecture reveals unique heteromeric interactions for this important class of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor. This work provides a template for understanding receptor modulation by GABA and benzodiazepines, and will assist rational approaches to therapeutic targeting of this receptor for neurological disorders and mental illness.},

abstract = {Functional membranes containing purified Torpedo californica acetylcholine receptor and dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) were prepared by a cholate dialysis procedure with lipid to protein ratios of 100-400 to 1 (mol/mol). Spin-labeled lipids were incorporated into the reconstituted membranes and into native membranes prepared from Torpedo electroplax, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded between 0 and 20 degrees C. The spin-labels included nitroxide derivatives of stearic acid (16-doxylstearic acid), androstane, phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), and phosphatidic acid (PA). The phospholipid spin-labels had 16-doxylstearic acid in the sn-2 position. All the spectra showed two components corresponding to a relatively mobile bilayer component and a motionally restricted "protein-perturbed" component. The relative amounts of mobile and perturbed components were quantitated by spectral subtraction and integration techniques. The mobile/perturbed ratio was somewhat temperature dependent, and the results are discussed in terms of exchange between mobile and perturbed environments. Plots of the mobile/perturbed ratios vs. lipid/protein ratios at 1 degree C gave straight lines from which the relative binding affinity of each spin-label and the number of perturbed lipids per receptor protein could be calculated. All the spin-labels gave similar values for the number of perturbed lipids (40 +/- 7), a number close to the number of lipids that will fit around the intramembranous perimeter of the receptor. The affinities of the spin-labeled lipids for the receptor relative to DOPC were androstane (K = 4.3) congruent to 16-doxylstearic acid (4.1) greater than PA (2.7) greater than PE (1.1) approximately PC (1.0) approximately PS (0.7). The lipids having the highest affinity for the acetylcholine receptor were also those that have the largest effects on the ion flux functional properties of the receptor, and the results are discussed in terms of lipid effects on receptor function.},

Here, we show that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a key $\omega$−3 polyunsaturated fatty acid in synaptic membranes, enhances the agonist-induced transition to the desensitized state in the prokaryotic channel GLIC. We determined a 3.25 {\AA} crystal structure of the GLIC-DHA complex in a potentially desensitized conformation. The DHA molecule is bound at the channel-periphery near the M4 helix and exerts a long-range allosteric effect on the pore across domain-interfaces. In this previously unobserved conformation, the extracellular-half of the pore-lining M2 is splayed open, reminiscent of the open conformation, while the intracellular-half is constricted, leading to a loss of both water and permeant ions. These findings, in combination with spin-labeling/EPR spectroscopic measurements in reconstituted-membranes, provide novel mechanistic details of desensitization in pentameric channels.},

The channels open transiently upon the binding of a neurotransmitter released from the presynaptic nerve terminal, eliciting an electrical response. Membrane lipids also play a vital but poorly understood role in this process of synaptic transmission. The present study examines the lipid distribution around nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors in tubular vesicles made from postsynaptic membranes of the {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Torpedo{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} ray, taking advantage of the recent advances in cryo-EM. A segregated distribution of lipid molecules is found in the outer leaflet of the bilayer. Apparent cholesterol-rich patches are located in specific annular regions next to the transmembrane helices and also in a more extended `microdomain' between the apposed $\delta$ subunits of neighbouring receptors. The particular lipid distribution can be interpreted straightforwardly in relation to the gating movements revealed by an earlier time-resolved cryo-EM study, in which the membranes were exposed briefly to ACh. The results suggest that in addition to stabilizing the protein, cholesterol may play a mechanical role by conferring local rigidity to the membrane so that there is productive coupling between the extracellular and membrane domains, leading to opening of the channel. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Torpedo acetylcholine receptor was reconstituted into liposomes of pure synthetic lipids in order to study the influence of the lipid environment on affinity state transitions and the ion translocation function of the receptor. A critical concentration of 30 to 40{\%} of cholesteryl hemisuccinate was necessary in liposomes made of cholesteryl hemisuccinate and dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine to mimic the kinetics of agonist-induced state transitions observed in native membranes. With increasing chain length of the saturated lecithins, a marked increase in carbamylcholine dissociation constants was observed. Substitution by other dimyristoyl phospholipids for dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine had the same, though quantitatively less pronounced effects. Introduction of unsaturation in the acyl chains reverted the effect of increasing chain length. Unsaturated phosphatidylethanolamines in combination with 28-35 mol{\%} of cholesteryl hemisuccinate was the best lipid mixture for reconstitution of the receptor-gating function. When phosphatidylethanolamine was replaced totally or partially by other phospholipids with the same or different acyl chain composition, a marked decrease of ion transport was apparent, even when similar vesicle size, receptor incorporation, and agonist-induced affinity transitions were obtained. Therefore, the maintenance of the affinity state transitions of the reconstituted receptor is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the manifestation of the ion-gating receptor activity. On the other hand, the more unsaturated the acyl chains of phosphatidylethanolamine are, the higher the response that was observed, suggesting that a critical lipid packing is essential for the ion translocation function of the receptor.},

abstract = {Rapsyn, a peripheral membrane protein of skeletal muscle, clusters nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) at high density in the postsynaptic membrane. The mechanism of nAChR clustering by rapsyn was analyzed by expressing nAChRs in HEK293T cells with various fragments of mouse rapsyn fused to green fluorescent protein. Membrane targeting of rapsyn is conferred solely by its acylated N terminus, as the myristoylated N-terminal 15 amino acids of rapsyn are sufficient to target green fluorescent protein to the plasma membrane. However, neither N-terminal myristoylation nor the conserved N-terminal amino acid sequence is essential. Membrane targeting, self-association, and nAChR clustering are preserved when the first 10 amino acids of rapsyn were replaced by those of src, which also contains a consensus sequence for N-myristoylation, or by those of GAP43, which contains a palmitoylation sequence. Rapsyn1-90, containing two tetratrichopeptide repeats is sufficient for self-association. Rapsyn1-360, lacking the cysteine rich domain, clusters nAChRs, while rapsyn1-287, containing seven tetratrichopeptide repeats, does not cluster nAChRs. We identified rapsyn298-331 as a potential coiled-coil domain, and established that mutations disrupting coiled-coil propensity prevent nAChR clustering. Thus the structural domains of rapsyn necessary for membrane targeting, self-association, and nAChR clustering are distinct, with nAChR-rapsyn interaction mediated by a previously unrecognized coiled-coil motif.},

abstract = {Recently discovered bacterial homologues of eukaryotic pentameric ligand-gated ion channels, such as the Gloeobacter violaceus receptor (GLIC), are increasingly used as structural and functional models of signal transduction in the nervous system. Here we present a one-microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulation of the GLIC channel pH stimulated gating mechanism. The crystal structure of GLIC obtained at acidic pH in an open-channel form is equilibrated in a membrane environment and then instantly set to neutral pH. The simulation shows a channel closure that rapidly takes place at the level of the hydrophobic furrow and a progressively increasing quaternary twist. Two major events are captured during the simulation. They are initiated by local but large fluctuations in the pore, taking place at the top of the M2 helix, followed by a global tertiary relaxation. The two-step transition of the first subunit starts within the first 50 ns of the simulation and is followed at 450 ns by its immediate neighbor in the pentamer, which proceeds with a similar scenario. This observation suggests a possible two-step domino-like tertiary mechanism that takes place between adjacent subunits. In addition, the dynamical properties of GLIC described here offer an interpretation of the paradoxical properties of a permeable A13'F mutant whose crystal structure determined at 3.15 A shows a pore too narrow to conduct ions.},

Its transmembrane domain is the target for many modulators, including endogenous brain neurosteroids that impact anxiety, stress and depression, and for therapeutic drugs, such as general anesthetics. Understanding the basis for the modulation of GABAAR function requires high-resolution structures. Here we present the first atomic structures of a GABAAR chimera at 2.8-{\AA} resolution, including those bound with potentiating and inhibitory neurosteroids. These structures define new allosteric binding sites for these modulators that are associated with the $\alpha$-subunit transmembrane domain. Our findings will enable the exploitation of neurosteroids for therapeutic drug design to regulate GABAARs in neurological disorders.},

abstract = {Interactions between lipids and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor from Torpedo californica have been measured in reconstituted membranes containing purified receptor and defined lipids. The ability of brominated lipids to partially quench the intrinsic fluorescence of the acetylcholine receptor has been exploited to monitor contacts between the protein and the surrounding lipid. Relative binding constants for lipid binding to the protein have been quantitatively determined by measuring quenching observed in mixtures of brominated and nonbrominated lipids by use of equilibrium exchange equations developed by London and Feigenson [London, E., {\&} Feigenson, G. W. (1981) Biochemistry 20, 1939-1948] and by Simmonds et al. [Simmonds, A. C., Rooney, E. K., {\&} Lee, A. G. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 1432-1441]. Dioleoylphosphatidylcholine and its dibromo derivative are the two principal lipids used in the reconstituted membranes to establish the quenching parameters. Competition studies between cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine indicate that cholesterol does not compete effectively for the phospholipid sites presumed to surround the membrane-embedded portions of the receptor (annular lipids). However, dibromocholesterol partially quenches the receptor and leads to additional quenching of receptor in pure dibromophosphatidylcholine membranes. The results are consistent with the presence of additional binding sites for cholesterol that are not accessible to phospholipids (nonannular sites). Similar results are obtained by using cholesterol hemisuccinate and its dibromo analogue, both of which can be introduced into membranes more easily than cholesterol because of their greater solubility in water. Fatty acids appear to compete for both annular and nonannular sites, and analysis of the quenching data suggests that there are 5-10 nonannular sites associated with the receptor. Cholesterol has been shown to play a critical role in both acetylcholine receptor structural stabilization and ion channel activity, and the results presented here provide additional information about cholesterol-receptor interactions.},

abstract = {The $\alpha$4$\beta$2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) has significant roles in nervous system function and disease. It is also a molecular target of general anesthetics. Anesthetics inhibit the $\alpha$4$\beta$2 nAChR at clinically relevant concentrations, but their binding sites in $\alpha$4$\beta$2 remain unclear. The recently determined NMR structures of the $\alpha$4$\beta$2 nAChR transmembrane (TM) domains provide valuable frameworks for identifying the binding sites. In this study, we performed solution NMR experiments on the $\alpha$4$\beta$2 TM domains in the absence and presence of halothane and ketamine. Both anesthetics were found in an intra-subunit cavity near the extracellular end of the $\beta$2 transmembrane helices, homologous to a common anesthetic binding site observed in X-ray structures of anesthetic-bound GLIC (Nury et al., [32]). Halothane, but not ketamine, was also found in cavities adjacent to the common anesthetic site at the interface of $\alpha$4 and $\beta$2. In addition, both anesthetics bound to cavities near the ion selectivity filter at the intracellular end of the TM domains. Anesthetic binding induced profound changes in protein conformational exchanges. A number of residues, close to or remote from the binding sites, showed resonance signal splitting from single to double peaks, signifying that anesthetics decreased conformation exchange rates. It was also evident that anesthetics shifted population of two conformations. Altogether, the study comprehensively resolved anesthetic binding sites in the $\alpha$4$\beta$2 nAChR. Furthermore, the study provided compelling experimental evidence of anesthetic-induced changes in protein dynamics, especially near regions of the hydrophobic gate and ion selectivity filter that directly regulate channel functions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, they are a therapeutic target for the treatment of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, and drugs that potentiate $\alpha$7 nAChRs through the regulation of desensitization are currently being developed. Recently, these channels were found to be localized into lipid rafts. Here we show that the disruption of lipid rafts in rat primary hippocampal neurons, through cholesterol-scavenging drugs (methyl-$\beta$-cyclodextrin) and the enzymatic breakdown of sphingomyelin (sphingomyelinase), results in significant changes in the desensitization kinetics of native and expressed $\alpha$7 nAChRs. These effects can be prevented by cotreatment with cholesterol and sphingomyelin, and can be mimicked by treatment with cholesterol and sphingomyelin synthesis inhibitors (mevastatin and myriocin, respectively), suggesting that the effects on desensitization kinetics are indeed due to changes in the levels of cholesterol and sphingomyelin in the plasma membrane. These data provide new insights into themechanism of desensitization of $\alpha$7 nAChRs by providing evidence that the lipid composition of the plasma membrane can modulate the activity of the $\alpha$7 nAChRs.},

Structure-guided mutagenesis and electrophysiological data confirmed the presence of the $\alpha$2(+)/$\alpha$2(-) binding site on the heteromeric low sensitivity $\alpha$2$\beta$2 nAChR and validated the functional importance of specific residues in $\alpha$2 and $\beta$2 nAChR subunits. Given the pathological importance of the $\alpha$2 nAChR subunit and the high sequence identity with $\alpha$4 (78{\%}) and other neuronal nAChR subunits, our findings offer valuable information for modeling several nAChRs and ultimately for structure-based design of subtype specific drugs against the nAChR associated diseases.},

abstract = {Cholesterol is an essential component of cell membranes, and is required for mammalian pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC) function. Computational studies suggest direct interactions between cholesterol and pLGICs but experimental evidence identifying specific binding sites is limited. In this study, we mapped cholesterol binding to Gloeobacter ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC), a model pLGIC chosen for its high level of expression, existing crystal structure, and previous use as a prototypic pLGIC. Using two cholesterol analogue photolabeling reagents with the photoreactive moiety on opposite ends of the sterol, we identified two cholesterol binding sites: an intersubunit site between TM3 and TM1 of adjacent subunits and an intrasubunit site between TM1 and TM4. In both the inter- and intrasubunit sites, cholesterol is oriented such that the 3‑OH group points toward the center of the transmembrane domains rather than toward either the cytosolic or extracellular surfaces. We then compared this binding to that of the cholesterol metabolite, allopregnanolone, a neurosteroid that allosterically modulates pLGICs. The same binding pockets were identified for allopregnanolone and cholesterol, but the binding orientation of the two ligands was markedly different, with the 3‑OH group of allopregnanolone pointing to the intra- and extracellular termini of the transmembrane domains rather than to their centers. We also found that cholesterol increases, whereas allopregnanolone decreases the thermal stability of GLIC. These data indicate that cholesterol and neurosteroids bind to common hydrophobic pockets in the model pLGIC, GLIC, but that their effects depend on the orientation and specific molecular interactions unique to each sterol.},

J Mol Biol 346:967-989]. Purified nAChR must be reconstituted in a mixture containing cholesterol to function. Proposed modes of interaction between cholesterol and the protein range from specific binding to indirect membrane-mediated mechanisms. However, the underlying cause of nAChR sensitivity to cholesterol remains controversial, in part because the vast majority of functional studies were conducted before a medium resolution structure was reported. We show that the nAChR contains internal sites capable of containing cholesterol, whose occupation stabilizes the protein structure. We detect sites at the protein-lipid interface as conventionally predicted from functional data, as well as deeply buried sites that are not usually considered. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that occupation of both superficial and deeply buried sites most effectively preserves the experimental structure; the structure collapses in the absence of bound cholesterol. In particular, we find that bound cholesterol directly supports contacts between the agonist-binding domain and the pore that are thought to be essential for activation of the receptor. These results likely apply to those other ion channels within the Cys-loop superfamily that depend on cholesterol, such as the GABA receptor.},

abstract = {Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are integral membrane proteins and prototypic members of the ligand-gated ion-channel superfamily, which has precursors in the prokaryotic world. They are formed by the assembly of five transmembrane subunits, selected from a pool of 17 homologous polypeptides (alpha1-10, beta1-4, gamma, delta, and epsilon). There are many nAChR subtypes, each consisting of a specific combination of subunits, which mediate diverse physiological functions. They are widely expressed in the central nervous system, while, in the periphery, they mediate synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction and ganglia. nAChRs are also found in non-neuronal/nonmuscle cells (keratinocytes, epithelia, macrophages, etc.). Extensive research has determined the specific function of several nAChR subtypes. nAChRs are now important therapeutic targets for various diseases, including myasthenia gravis, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and schizophrenia, as well as for the cessation of smoking. However, knowledge is still incomplete, largely because of a lack of high-resolution X-ray structures for these molecules. Nevertheless, electron microscopy studies on 2D crystals of nAChR from fish electric organs and the determination of the high-resolution X-ray structure of the acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP) from snails, a homolog of the extracellular domain of the nAChR, have been major steps forward and the data obtained have important implications for the design of subtype-specific drugs. Here, we review some of the latest advances in our understanding of nAChRs and their involvement in physiology and pathology.},

abstract = {Summary The gating of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels is sensitive to a variety of allosteric modulators that act on structures peripheral to those involved in the allosteric pathway leading from the agonist site to the channel gate. One such structure, the lipid-exposed transmembrane $\alpha$ helix, M4, is the target of lipids, neurosteroids, and disease-causing mutations. Here we show that M4 interactions with the adjacent transmembrane $\alpha$ helices, M1 and M3, modulate pLGIC function. Enhanced M4 interactions promote channel function while ineffective interactions reduce channel function. The interface chemistry governs the intrinsic strength of M4-M1/M3 inter-helical interactions, both influencing channel gating and imparting distinct susceptibilities to the potentiating effects of a lipid-facing M4 congenital myasthenic syndrome mutation. Through aromatic substitutions, functional studies, and molecular dynamics simulations, we elucidate a mechanism by which M4 modulates channel function.},

abstract = {Direct structural insight into the mechanisms underlying activation and desensitization remain unavailable for the pentameric ligand-gated channel family. Here, we report the structural rearrangements underlying gating transitions in membrane-embedded GLIC, a prokaryotic homologue, using site-directed spin labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. We particularly probed the conformation of pore-lining second transmembrane segment (M2) under conditions that favor the closed and the ligand-bound desensitized states. The spin label mobility, intersubunit spin-spin proximity, and the solvent-accessibility parameters in the two states clearly delineate the underlying protein motions within M2. Our results show that during activation the extracellular hydrophobic region undergoes major changes involving an outward translational movement, away from the pore axis, leading to an increase in the pore diameter, whereas the lower end of M2 remains relatively immobile. Most notably, during desensitization, the intervening polar residues in the middle of M2 move closer to form a solvent-occluded barrier and thereby reveal the location of a distinct desensitization gate. In comparison with the crystal structure of GLIC, the structural dynamics of the channel in a membrane environment suggest a more loosely packed conformation with water-accessible intrasubunit vestibules penetrating from the extracellular end all the way to the middle of M2 in the closed state. These regions have been implicated to play a major role in alcohol and drug modulation. Overall, these findings represent a key step toward understanding the fundamentals of gating mechanisms in this class of channels.},

abstract = {Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) are targets of general anesthetics, but molecular mechanisms underlying anesthetic action remain debatable. We found that ELIC, a pLGIC from Erwinia chrysanthemi, can be functionally inhibited by isoflurane and other anesthetics. Structures of ELIC co-crystallized with isoflurane in the absence or presence of an agonist revealed double isoflurane occupancies inside the pore near T237(6') and A244(13'). A pore-radius contraction near the extracellular entrance was observed upon isoflurane binding. Electrophysiology measurements with a single-point mutation at position 6' or 13' support the notion that binding at these sites renders isoflurane inhibition. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that isoflurane binding was more stable in the resting than in a desensitized pore conformation. This study presents compelling evidence for a direct pore-binding mechanism of isoflurane inhibition, which has a general implication for inhibitory action of general anesthetics on pLGICs.},

abstract = {Abstract With the availability of high resolution structural data, increasing attention has focused on the mechanisms by which drugs and endogenous compounds allosterically modulate nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) function. Lipids are potent modulators of the nAChR from Torpedo. Membrane lipids influence nAChR function by both conformational selection and kinetic mechanisms, stabilizing varying proportions of pre-existing resting, open, desensitized, and uncoupled conformations, as well as influencing the transitions between these conformational states. Structural and functional data highlight a role for the lipid-exposed M4 transmembrane ??-helix of each subunit in lipid sensing, and suggest that lipids influence gating by altering the binding of M4 to the adjacent transmembrane ??-helices, M1 and M3. M4 has also been implicated in both the folding and trafficking of nAChRs to the cell surface, as well as in the potentiation of nAChR gating by neurosteroids. Here, we discuss the roles of M4 in the folding, trafficking, and allosteric modulation of nAChRs. We also consider the hypothesis that variable chemistry at the M4-M1/M3 transmembrane ??-helical interface in different nAChR subunits governs the capacity for potentiation by activating lipids.

abstract = {The effects of cholesterol (Chol) and an anionic lipid,  dioleoylphosphatidic acid (DOPA) on the conformational equilibria of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor  (nAChR) have been investigated using Fourier trans-  form infrared difference spectroscopy. The difference  between spectra recorded in the presence and absence  of agonist from the nAChR reconstituted into 3:1:1 egg  phosphatidylcholine (EPC)/DOPA/Chol membranes exhibits positive and negative bands that serve as markers  of the structural changes associated with the resting to  desensitized conformational change. These markers are  absent in similar difference spectra recorded from the  nAChR reconstituted into EPC membranes lacking both  Chol and DOPA, indicating that the nAChR cannot un-  dergo conformational change in response to agonist  binding. When low levels of either Chol or DOPA up to 25  mol {\%} of the total lipid are included in the EPC membranes, the markers suggest the predominant stabilization of a conformation that is a structural intermediate  between the resting and desensitized states. At higher  levels of either Chol or DOPA, the nAChR is stabilized in  a conformation that is capable of undergoing agonist-induced desensitization, although DOPA appears to be  required for the nAChR to adopt a conformation fully  equivalent to that found in native and 3:1:1 EPC/DOPA/  Chol membranes. The ability of these two structurally  diverse lipids, as well as others (Ryan, S. E., Demers,  C. N., Chew, J. P., Baenziger, J. E. (1996) J. Biol. Chem.  271, 24590 –24597), to modulate the functional state of  the nAChR suggests that lipids act on the nAChR via an indirect effect on some physical property of the lipid  bilayer. The data also suggest that anionic lipids are  essential to stabilize a fully functional nAChR. We propose that membrane fluidity modulates the relative pop-  ulations of nAChRs in the resting and desensitized  states but that subtle structural changes in the presence of anionic lipids are essential for full activity. },

abstract = {Anionic lipids and cholesterols (CHOL) are critical to the function of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR). We investigated their interactions with an open- and closed-channel alpha4beta2 nAChR by over 10 ns molecular dynamics simulations in a ternary lipid mixture of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidic acid (POPA), and CHOL with a ratio of 3:1:1 (Haddadian et al., J. Phys. Chem. B 2008, 112, 13981). On average there were 65 and 74 interfacial lipids around the closed- and open-channel alpha4beta2 nAChR, respectively, in the equilibrated simulation systems. In the open-channel system, 42{\%} of the interfacial POPA had acyl chains partially inserted into intra- or intersubunit cavities, as compared to only 7{\%} in the closed-channel alpha4beta2. No CHOL was found in cavities within single subunits, though some CHOL infiltrated into the gaps between subunits. Because of its smaller headgroup, POPA could access some nonannular sites where POPC could not easily reach due to steric exclusion. Furthermore, POPA acted not only as an acceptor for hydrogen bonding (H bonding) as POPC did, but also as a donor through its hydroxyl group for H bonding with the backbone of the protein. The charged headgroup of POPA allowed the lipid to form stable salt bridges with conserved Arg and Lys residues at the interfaces of the transmembrane (TM) and extracellular (EC) or intracellular (IC) domains of the alpha4beta2. A higher number of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds (H bonds) between POPA and the alpha4beta2 nAChR were found in the open system than in the closed system, suggesting a potential role of POPA in the equilibrium between different channel states. Most interfacial POPA molecules showed lower order parameters than the bulk POPA due to the mixed effect of gauche defects, hydrophobic mismatch, and the lipid orientations near the magic angle. These unique properties enable the interfacial POPA to achieve what POPC cannot with regard to specific interactions with the protein, thereby making POPA essential for the function of nAChR.},

abstract = {Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) are ubiquitous neurotransmitter receptors in Bilateria, with a small number of known prokaryotic homologues. Here we describe a new inventory and phylogenetic analysis of pLGIC genes across all kingdoms of life. Our main finding is a set of pLGIC genes in unicellular eukaryotes, some of which are metazoan-like Cys-loop receptors, and others devoid of Cys-loop cysteines, like their prokaryotic relatives. A number of such "Cys-less" receptors also appears in invertebrate metazoans. Together, those findings draw a new distribution of pLGICs in eukaryotes. A broader distribution of prokaryotic channels also emerges, including a major new archaeal taxon, Thaumarchaeota. More generally, pLGICs now appear nearly ubiquitous in major taxonomic groups except multicellular plants and fungi. However, pLGICs are sparsely present in unicellular taxa, suggesting a high rate of gene loss and a non-essential character, contrasting with their essential role as synaptic receptors of the bilaterian nervous system. Multiple alignments of these highly divergent sequences reveal a small number of conserved residues clustered at the interface between the extracellular and transmembrane domains. Only the "Cys-loop" proline is absolutely conserved, suggesting the more fitting name "Pro loop" for that motif, and "Pro-loop receptors" for the superfamily. The infered molecular phylogeny shows a Cys-loop and a Cys-less clade in eukaryotes, both containing metazoans and unicellular members. This suggests new hypotheses on the evolutionary history of the superfamily, such as a possible origin of the Cys-loop cysteines in an ancient unicellular eukaryote. Deeper phylogenetic relationships remain uncertain, particularly around the split between bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes.},

Deterioration in the quality of sperm worldwide is the recent scenario and one of its reasons is testicular ischemic/ reperfusion (IR) injury. Therefore the present study aims at producing new drugs for the treatment of testicular IR injury. Methods: 42 animals were selected for the study and divided into 7 groups, each containing 6 rats. Bioflavonoids were tested for their efficacy in reversing the damage done to the testicular tissue by causing testicular torsion and detorsion in rats. As oxidative stress produced in the above condition causes tissue damage, MDA level was measured and antioxidant enzymes SOD and catalse were evaluated. Histological examination was conducted to find the extent of damage and the protective effect of rutin and naringin. One-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc test were used for data analysis. A p-value{\textless}0.001 was considered statistically significant. Results: MDA levels increased and antioxidant enzymes decreased drastically in the group of rats with testicular torsion and detorsion which clearly indicates a rise in oxidative stress (68{\%} rise in the case of MDA and 20{\%} and 16{\%} decrease in SOD and catalase concentrations, respectively). Rutin and naringin-treated groups showed the beneficial effects of the medicinal drugs, particularly in higher doses. Rutin, 10 mg/kg, was effective when compared to naringin in providing protection. Compared to the animals in the control group, there was a 30{\%} reduction in MDA levels and a 20{\%} increment in SOD levels plus a five-fold increase in catalse in the rutin-treated group (10 mg/kg). Histological examination supported the above claims. Conclusion: Oxidative stress in testicular injury affects the quality of sperm. Rutin and naringin in higher doses protected testicular tissue effectively. Further studies in this direction may prove beneficial.},

abstract = {The glycine receptor belongs to the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily. It is a chloride conducting channel composed of four transmembrane domains. It was previously shown that the second transmembrane domain (M2) of the glycine receptor forms an ion conduction pathway throught lipid bilayers. The amino-acid sequence of the transmembrane segment M2 of the glycine receptor has a high homology to all receptors of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily. In our report, we have used a synthetic M2 peptide. It was incorporated into a planar membrane of known lipid composition and currents induced by M2 were measured by the Black Lipid Membrane technique. When the planar lipid bilayer was composed of 75{\%} phosphatidylethanolamine and 25{\%} phosphatidylserine, the reversal potential measured in a 150/600 mM KCl (cis/trans) gradient was -19 mV suggesting that the examined pore was preferential to anions, P K /P Cl  = 0.25. In contrast, when 75{\%} phosphatidylserine and 25{\%} phosphatidylethanolamine was used, the reversal potential was +20 mV and the pore was preferential to cations, P K /P Cl  = 4.36. Single-channel currents were recorded with two predominant amplitudes corresponding to the main-conductance and sub-conductance states. Both conductance states (about 12 pS and 30 pS) were measured in a symmetric solution of 50 mM KCl. The observed single-channel properties suggest that the selectivity and conductance of the pore formed by the M2 peptide of the glycine receptor depend on the lipid composition of the planar bilayer.},

abstract = {Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels or Cys-loop receptors are responsible for fast inhibitory or excitatory synaptic transmission. The antipsychotic compound chlorpromazine is a widely used tool to probe the ion channel pore of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which is a prototypical Cys-loop receptor. In this study, we determine the molecular determinants of chlorpromazine binding in the Erwinia ligand-gated ion channel (ELIC). We report the X-ray crystal structures of ELIC in complex with chlorpromazine or its brominated derivative bromopromazine. Unexpectedly, we do not find a chlorpromazine molecule in the channel pore of ELIC, but behind the $\beta$8-$\beta$9 loop in the extracellular ligand-binding domain. The $\beta$8-$\beta$9 loop is localized downstream from the neurotransmitter binding site and plays an important role in coupling of ligand binding to channel opening. In combination with electrophysiological recordings from ELIC cysteine mutants and a thiol-reactive derivative of chlorpromazine, we demonstrate that chlorpromazine binding at the $\beta$8-$\beta$9 loop is responsible for receptor inhibition. We further use molecular-dynamics simulations to support the X-ray data and mutagenesis experiments. Together, these data unveil an allosteric binding site in the extracellular ligand-binding domain of ELIC. Our results extend on previous observations and further substantiate our understanding of a multisite model for allosteric modulation of Cys-loop receptors.},

The high sequence diversity of prokaryotic receptors makes them unique model systems to understand evolutionary conservation in gating and sensitivity to allosteric modulators. We present the 2.3 {\AA} X-ray structure of a pLGIC (sTeLIC) from a gammaproteobacteria that is activated at alkaline pH. The structure at pH 8.0 displays an unusually open pore. It is unchanged, but less flexible, in the presence of a positive allosteric modulator that binds in a cavity where benzodiazepines are found in Erwinia chrysanthemi pLGIC. This cavity is also present (and druggable) in the 5HT3-receptor.},

abstract = {Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) play a central role in intercellular communication in the nervous system and are involved in fundamental processes such as attention, learning, and memory. They are oligomeric protein assemblies that convert a chemical signal into an ion flux through the postsynaptic membrane, but the molecular mechanism of gating ions has remained elusive. Here, we present atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of the prokaryotic channels from Gloeobacter violaceus (GLIC) and Erwinia chrysanthemi (ELIC), whose crystal structures are thought to represent the active and the resting states of pLGICs, respectively, and of the eukaryotic glutamate-gated chloride channel from Caenorhabditis elegans (GluCl), whose open-channel structure was determined complexed with the positive allosteric modulator ivermectin. Structural observables extracted from the trajectories of GLIC and ELIC are used as progress variables to analyze the time evolution of GluCl, which was simulated in the absence of ivermectin starting from the structure with bound ivermectin. The trajectory of GluCl with ivermectin removed shows a sequence of structural events that couple agonist unbinding from the extracellular domain to ion-pore closing in the transmembrane domain. Based on these results, we propose a structural mechanism for the allosteric communication leading to deactivation/activation of the GluCl channel. This model of gating emphasizes the coupling between the quaternary twisting and the opening/closing of the ion pore and is likely to apply to other members of the pLGIC family.},

Here we present an atomic model of the closed pore, obtained by electron microscopy of crystalline postsynaptic membranes. The pore is shaped by an inner ring of 5 alpha-helices, which curve radially to create a tapering path for the ions, and an outer ring of 15 alpha-helices, which coil around each other and shield the inner ring from the lipids. The gate is a constricting hydrophobic girdle at the middle of the lipid bilayer, formed by weak interactions between neighbouring inner helices. When acetylcholine enters the ligand-binding domain, it triggers rotations of the protein chains on opposite sides of the entrance to the pore. These rotations are communicated through the inner helices, and open the pore by breaking the girdle apart.},

Aminated local anesthetics were found to compete with spin-labeled phosphatidylinositol, but to a much lesser extent with spin-labeled stearic acid, for sites on the intramembranous surface of the protein. The relative association constant of phosphatidylinositol was reduced in the presence of the different local anesthetics to the following extents: tetracaine (55{\%}) {\textgreater} procaine (35{\%}) ≈ benzocaine (30{\%}). For stearic acid, only tetracaine gave an appreciable reduction (30{\%}) in association constant. These displacements represent an intrinsic difference in affinity of the local anesthetics for the lipid−protein interface because the membrane partition coefficients are in the order benzocaine ≫ tetracaine ≈ procaine.},

abstract = {Lidocaine is a local anaesthetic that blocks sodium channels, but also inhibits several ligand-gated ion-channels. The aim of this work was to unravel the mechanisms by which lidocaine blocks Torpedo nicotinic receptors transplanted to Xenopus oocytes. Acetylcholine-elicited currents were reversibly blocked by lidocaine, in a concentration dependent manner. At doses lower than the IC(50) , lidocaine blocked nicotinic receptors only at negative potentials, indicating an open-channel blockade; the binding site within the channel was at about 30{\%} of the way through the electrical field across the membrane. In the presence of higher lidocaine doses, nicotinic receptors were blocked both at positive and negative potentials, acetylcholine dose-response curve shifted to the right and lidocaine pre-application, before its co-application with acetylcholine, enhanced the current inhibition, indicating all together that lidocaine also blocked resting receptors; besides, it increased the current decay rate. When lidocaine, at low doses, was co-applied with 2-(triethylammonio)-N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl) acetamide bromide, edrophonium or 1,5-bis(4-allyldimethylammoniumphenyl)pentan-3-one dibromide, which are quaternary-ammonium molecules that also blocked nicotinic receptors, there was an additive inhibitory effect, indicating that these molecules bound to different sites within the channel pore. These results prove that lidocaine blocks nicotinic receptors by several independent mechanisms and evidence the diverse and complex modulation of this receptor by structurally related molecules.},

With the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) from Torpedo, current models suggest that lipids modulate the natural equilibrium between resting and desensitized conformations. We show that the lipid-inactivated nAChR is not desensitized, instead it adopts a novel conformation where the allosteric coupling between its neurotransmitter-binding sites and transmembrane pore is lost. The uncoupling is accompanied by an unmasking of previously buried residues, suggesting weakened association between structurally intact agonist-binding and transmembrane domains. These data combined with the extensive literature on Cys-loop receptor-lipid interactions suggest that the M4 transmembrane helix plays a key role as a lipid-sensor, translating bilayer properties into altered nAChR function.},

GlyR typically modulates inhibitory transmission by antagonizing membrane depolarization through anion influx. Allosteric interactions between the receptor and its lipid surroundings affect receptor function, and cholesterol is essential for pLGIC activity. Cholesterol at compositions below ∼33 mol percent has been shown to have negligible chemical activity, suggesting that specific interactions between membrane proteins and cholesterol become significant only at concentrations above this stoichiometric threshold. Human $\alpha$1 GlyR was purified from baculovirus infected insect cells and reconstituted in unilamellar vesicles at cholesterol/lipid ratios above and below the cholesterol activity threshold with equivalent aliquots of azi-cholesterol, a photoactivatable nonspecific cross-linker. After photoactivation, cross-linked cholesterol-GlyR was trypsinized and mass fingerprinted. Mass shifted peptides containing cholesterol were identified by electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-Q-TOF MS), and sites of direct covalent attachment to peptides were refined by targeted MS/MS. Differential patterns of dozens of cholesterol-GlyR cross-links were identified in these comparative studies, with sites of cross-linking found primarily in the fourth transmembrane helix and extramembranous connecting loops and mapping the lipid-accessible surface of the receptor. Unique cross-linking observed in both reduced and elevated cholesterol composition suggests different apo-state structural conformations of GlyR as a function of cholesterol concentration and, in the latter studies, identified potential specific binding sites for cholesterol in the receptor.},

Fluorescence studies from our laboratory have identified discrete sites for fatty acids, phospholipids, and cholesterol on the AChR protein, and electron-spin resonance spectros-copy has enabled the establishment of the stoichiometry and selectivity of the shell lipid for the AChR and the disclosure of lipid sites in the AChR transmembrane region. Experimental evidence supports the notion that the interface between the protein moiety and the adjacent lipid shell is the locus of a variety of pharmacologically relevant processes, including the action of steroids and other lipids. I surmise that the outermost ring of M4 helices constitutes the boundary interface, most suitable to convey the signals from the lipid microenviron-ment to the rest of the transmembrane region, and to the channel inner ring in particular. In memoriam Gaspar Fernandez-Nievas The AChR at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and at central nervous system cholinergic synapses is the key transducer of the chemical signal involved in cellular communication between nerve and vertebrate skeletal muscle and between neurons. Several genes coding for AChR subunits have been characterized within the super-family, also known as Cys-loop receptors. They exhibit not only amino acid sequence homology but, presumably, higher-order structural motifs. Until recently, the Cys-loop family was thought to comprise only ion channels produced by eukaryotic genes, but prokaryotic ion channels with remarkable structural similarity to members of the AChR family have recently been discovered (Bocquet et al. 2007, 2009; Hilf and Dutzler 2008). Each AChR subunit contains four hydrophobic seg-ments, 20–30 amino acids in length, the M1–M4 membrane-spanning segments. We have proposed that, in addition to these two main regions of the AChR, a third important domain is defined at the extensive interface between the protein and lipid moieties, comprising both the lipid-exposed TM portions of the AChR protein and the AChR-vicinal lipid (Barrantes 2003, 2004; Albuquerque et al. 2009). The latter corresponds to the lipid belt (" shell " , " annulus " , " boundary " , " AChR-vicinal ") region, which is the lipid moiety in the immediate perimeter of the AChR protein, earlier discovered using electron spin resonance (ESR) techniques (Marsh and Barrantes 1978) and further characterized in terms of lipid selectivity and stoichiometry (Barrantes 2004). In order to define the physical state of the AChR membrane lipids, we fostered two hitherto unexploited properties of the fluorescent probe Laurdan: (1) its ability to act as a F{\"{o}}rster-type resonance energy transfer (FRET) acceptor of tryptophan emission (Antollini et al.},

abstract = {The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is the prototypic member of the 'Cys-loop' superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels which mediate synaptic neurotransmission, and whose other members include receptors for glycine, gamma-aminobutyric acid and serotonin. Cryo-electron microscopy has yielded a three-dimensional structure of the nAChR in its closed state. However, the exact nature and location of the channel gate remains uncertain. Although the transmembrane pore is constricted close to its center, it is not completely occluded. Rather, the pore has a central hydrophobic zone of radius about 3 A. Model calculations suggest that such a constriction may form a hydrophobic gate, preventing movement of ions through a channel. We present a detailed and quantitative simulation study of the hydrophobic gating model of the nicotinic receptor, in order to fully evaluate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that the hydrophobic constriction of the nAChR pore indeed forms a closed gate. Potential of mean force (PMF) calculations reveal that the constriction presents a barrier of height about 10 kT to the permeation of sodium ions, placing an upper bound on the closed channel conductance of 0.3 pS. Thus, a 3 A radius hydrophobic pore can form a functional barrier to the permeation of a 1 A radius Na+ ion. Using a united-atom force field for the protein instead of an all-atom one retains the qualitative features but results in differing conductances, showing that the PMF is sensitive to the detailed molecular interactions.},

abstract = {With the long-term goal of using a chimeric approach to dissect the distinct lipid sensitivities and thermal stabilities of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGIC), GLIC and ELIC, we constructed chimeras by cross-combining their extracellular (ECD) and transmembrane (TMD) domains. As expected, the chimera formed between GLIC-ECD and ELIC-TMD (GE) responded to protons, the agonist for GLIC, but not cysteamine, the agonist for ELIC, although GE exhibited a 25-fold decrease in proton-sensitivity relative to wild type. The chimera formed between ELIC-ECD and the GLIC-TMD (EG) was usually toxic, unless it contained a pore-lining Ile9′Ala gain-of-function mutation. No significant improvements in expression/toxicity were observed with extensive loop substitutions at the ECD/TMD interface. Surprisingly, oocytes expressing EG-I9′A responded to both the ELIC agonist, cysteamine and the GLIC agonist, protons – the latter at pH values ≤ 4.0. The cysteamine- and proton-induced currents in EG-I9′A were inhibited by the GLIC TMD pore blocker, amantadine. The cysteamine-induced response of EG-I9′A was also inhibited by protons at pH values down to 4.5, but potentiated at lower pH values. Proton-induced gating at low pH was not abolished by mutation of an intramembrane histidine residue previously implicated in GLIC TMD function. We show that the TMD plays a major role governing the thermal stability of a pLGIC, and identify three distinct mechanisms by which agonists and protons influence the gating of the EG chimera. A structural basis for the impaired function of GE is suggested.},

abstract = {The ability of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) to undergo conformational transitions is exquisitely sensitive to its surrounding lipid environment. Previous work has highlighted a conformational selection mechanism, whereby different lipids stabilize different proportions of activatable resting versus nonactivatable conformations. In the absence of anionic lipids and cholesterol, the nAChR adopts an uncoupled conformation, which binds agonist with resting state-like affinity but does not usually undergo agonist-induced conformational transitions. Very slow (minutes to hours) transitions from uncoupled to coupled (resting, open and/or desensitized) conformations, however, can occur in membranes with relatively thick hydrophobic cores. Increasing membrane hydrophobic thickness 'awakens' uncoupled nAChRs by reducing the large activation energy barrier (or barriers) leading to coupled states, thus allowing conformational transitions to occur on an experimentally tractable timescale. Lipids shape activity by modulating the relative proportions of activatable versus nonactivatable conformations and by controlling the transitions between uncoupled and coupled conformations.},

abstract = {The lateral mobility of surface receptors can define the signaling properties of a synapse and rapidly change synaptic function. Here we use single-particle tracking with Quantum Dots to follow nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on the surface of chick ciliary ganglion neurons in culture. We find that both heteropentameric alpha3-containing receptors (alpha3*-nAChRs) and homopentameric alpha7-containing receptors (alpha7-nAChRs) access synaptic domains by lateral diffusion. They have comparable mobilities and display Brownian motion in extrasynaptic space but are constrained and move more slowly in synaptic space. The two receptor types differ in the nature of their synaptic restraints. Disruption of lipid rafts, PDZ-containing scaffolds, and actin filaments each increase the mobility of alpha7-nAChRs in synaptic space while collapse of microtubules has no effect. The opposite is seen for alpha3*-nAChRs where synaptic mobility is increased only by microtubule collapse and not the other manipulations. Other differences are found for regulation of alpha3*-nAChR and alpha7-nAChR mobilities in extrasynaptic space. Most striking are effects on the immobile populations of alpha7-nAChRs and alpha3*-nAChRs. Disruption of either lipid rafts or PDZ scaffolds renders half of the immobile alpha3*-nAChRs mobile without changing the proportion of immobile alpha7-nAChRs. Similar results were obtained with chick sympathetic ganglion neurons, though regulation of receptor mobility differed in at least one respect from that seen with ciliary ganglion neurons. Control of nAChR lateral mobility, therefore, is determined by mechanisms that are domain specific, receptor subtype dependent, and cell-type constrained. The outcome is a system that could tailor nicotinic signaling capabilities to specific needs of individual locations.},

abstract = {Zebrafish (Danio rerio) have been used to study multiple effects of nicotine, for example on cognition, locomotion, and stress responses, relying on the assumption that pharmacological tools will operate similarly upon molecular substrates in the fish and mammalian systems. We have cloned the zebrafish nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits and expressed key nAChR subtypes in Xenopus oocytes including neuronal ($\alpha$4$\beta$2, $\alpha$2$\beta$2, $\alpha$3$\beta$4, and $\alpha$7) and muscle ($\alpha$1$\beta$1b$\epsilon$$\delta$) nAChR. Consistent with studies of mammalian nAChR, nicotine was relatively inactive on muscle-type receptors, having both low potency and efficacy. It had high efficacy but low potency for $\alpha$7 receptors, and the best potency and good efficacy for $\alpha$4$\beta$2 receptors. Cytisine, a key lead compound for the development of smoking cessation agents, is a full agonist for both mammalian $\alpha$7 and $\alpha$3$\beta$4 receptors, but a full agonist only for the fish $\alpha$7, with surprisingly low efficacy for $\alpha$3$\beta$4. The efficacy of cytisine for $\alpha$4$\beta$2 was somewhat greater than typically reported for mammalian $\alpha$4$\beta$2. The ganglionic blocker mecamylamine was most potent for blocking $\alpha$3$\beta$4 receptors, least potent for $\alpha$7, and roughly equipotent for the muscle receptors and the $\beta$2-containing nAChR. However, the block of $\beta$2-containing receptors was slowly reversible, consistent with effective targeting of these CNS-type receptors in vivo. Three prototypical $\alpha$7-selective agonists, choline, tropane, and 4OH-GTS-21, were tested, and these agents were observed to activate both fish $\alpha$7 and $\alpha$4$\beta$2 nAChR. Our data therefore indicate that while some pharmacological tools used in zebrafish may function as expected, others will not. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Three cholesterol molecules could be docked on the transmembrane segments of each AChR subunit, rendering a total of 15 cholesterol molecules per AChR molecule. The CARC motifs contribute each with an energy of interaction between 35 and 52 kJ.mol(-1), adding up to a total of about 200 kJ.mol(-1) per receptor molecule, i.e. ∼40{\%} of the lipid solvation free energy/ AChR molecule.

Current data on structurally related modulators suggest that cholesterol binds to subunit interfaces between transmembrane domains of the GABAAR. We construct homology models of a human GABAAR based on the structure of the glutamate-gated chloride channel GluCl of Caenorhabditis elegans. The models show the possibility of previously unreported disulfide bridges linking the M1 and M3 transmembrane helices in the $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ subunits. We discuss the biological relevance of such disulfide bridges. Using our models, we investigate cholesterol binding to intersubunit cavities of the GABAAR transmembrane domain. We find that very similar binding modes are predicted independently by three approaches: analogy with ivermectin in the GluCl crystal structure, automated docking by AutoDock, and spontaneous rebinding events in unbiased molecular dynamics simulations. Taken together, the models and atomistic simulations suggest a somewhat flexible binding mode, with several possible orientations. Finally, we explore the possibility that cholesterol promotes pore opening through a wedge mechanism. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

We show here that membrane-reconstituted GLIC exhibits structural and biophysical properties similar to those of the membrane-reconstituted nAChR, although GLIC is substantially more thermally stable. GLIC, however, does not possess the same exquisite lipid sensitivity. In particular, GLIC does not exhibit the same propensity to adopt an uncoupled conformation where agonist binding is uncoupled from channel gating.

abstract = {Protein-lipid interactions were studied by using Torpedo californica acetylcholine receptor (AChR) as a model system by reconstituting purified AChR into membranes containing various synthetic lipids and native lipids. AChR function was determined by measuring 2 activities at 4.degree.: (1) low to high agonist affinity-state transition of AChR in the presence of an agonist (carbamylcholine [462-58-8]) in either membrane fragments or sealed vesicles and (2) ion-gating activity of AChR-containing vesicles in response to carbamylcholine. Sixteen samples were examined, each containing different lipid compns. including phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol [57-88-5], phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylethanolamine, asolectin, neutral lipid-depleted asolectin, native lipids, and cholesterol-depleted native lipids. Phosphatidylcholines with different configurations of fatty acyl chains were used. The dynamic structures of these membranes were probed by incorporating spin-labeled fatty acid into AChR-containing vesicles and measuring the order parameters. Both aspects of AChR function were highly dependent on the lipid environment even though carbamylcholine binding itself was not affected. An appropriate membrane fluidity was necessarily required to allow the interconversion between the low- and high-affinity states of AChR. An optimal fluidity hypothesis is proposed to account for the conformational transition properties of membrane proteins. In addition, the conformational change was only a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the AChR-mediated ion flux activity.

The crystal structure of Caenorhabditis elegans GluCl complexed with ivermectin revealed the details of its ivermectin binding site. Although the electron microscopy structure of zebrafish GlyR$\alpha$1 complexed with ivermectin demonstrated a similar binding orientation, detailed structural information on the ivermectin binding and pore opening for Cys-loop receptors in vertebrates has been elusive. Here we present the crystal structures of human GlyR$\alpha$3 in complex with ivermectin at 2.85 and 3.08 {\AA} resolution. Our structures allow us to explore in detail the molecular recognition of ivermectin by GlyRs, GABAARs, and $\alpha$7 nAChRs. Comparisons with previous structures reveal how the ivermectin binding expands the ion channel pore. Our results hold promise in structure-based design of GlyR modulators for the treatment of neuropathic pain.},

abstract = {Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are widely distributed throughout the central nervous system, being expressed in neurons and non-neuronal cells, where they participate in a variety of physiological responses like memory, learning, locomotion, attention, among others. We will focus on the $\alpha$7 nAChR subtype, which has been implicated in neuroprotection, synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival, and is considered as a potential therapeutic target for several neurological diseases. Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are currently considered as two of the most important pathological mechanisms common in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer, Parkinson or Huntington diseases. In this review, we will first analysed the distribution and expression of nAChR in mammalian brain. Then, we focused on the function of the $\alpha$7 nAChR subtype in neuronal and non-neuronal cells and its role in immune responses (cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway). Finally, we will revise the anti-inflammatory pathway promoted via $\alpha$7 nAChR activation that is related to recruitment and activation of Jak2/STAT3 pathway, which on the one hand inhibits NF-$\kappa$B nuclear translocation, and on the other hand, activates the master regulator of oxidative stress Nrf2/HO-1. This review provides a profound insight into the role of the $\alpha$7 nAChR subtype in microglia and point out to microglial $\alpha$7/HO-1 pathway as an anti-inflammatory therapeutic target.},

abstract = {The lipid requirements of the Torpedo californica nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) were assessed by reconstituting purified receptors into lipid vesicles of defined composition and by using photolabeling with 3-trifluoromethyl-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine ([125I]TID) to determine functionality. Earlier studies demonstrated that nAChRs reconstituted into membranes containing phosphatidylcholine (PC), the anionic lipid phosphatidic acid (PA), and cholesterol (CH) are particularly effective at stabilizing the nAChR in the resting (closed) state that is capable of undergoing agonist-induced conformational transitions (i.e., functionality). The present studies demonstrate that (1) there is no obligatory requirement for PC, (2) increasing the CH content serves to increase the degree to which nAChRs are stabilized in the resting state, and this effect saturates at approximately 35 mol {\%} (molar lipid percentage), and (3) the effect of increasing levels of PA saturates at approximately 12 mol {\%} and in the absence of PA nAChRs are stabilized in the desensitized state (i.e., nonfunctional). Native Torpedo membranes contain approximately 35 mol {\%} CH but less than 1 mol {\%} PA, suggesting that other anionic lipids may substitute for PA. We report that (1) phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol (PI), anionic lipids that are abundant in native Torpedo membranes, also stabilize the receptor in the resting state although with reduced efficacy (approximately 50-60{\%}) compared to PA, and (2) for nAChRs reconstituted into PA/CH membranes at different lipid-protein molar ratios, receptor functionality decreases rapidly below approximately 65 lipids per receptor. Collectively, these results are consistent with a functional requirement of a single shell of lipids surrounding the nAChR and specific anionic lipid- and sterol (CH)-protein interactions.},

abstract = {Cys-loop receptors are neurotransmitter-gated ion channels that are essential mediators of fast chemical neurotransmission and are associated with a large number of neurological diseases and disorders, as well as parasitic infections. Members of this ion channel superfamily mediate excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmission depending on their ligand and ion selectivity. Structural information for Cys-loop receptors comes from several sources including electron microscopic studies of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, high-resolution X-ray structures of extracellular domains and X-ray structures of bacterial orthologues. In 2011 our group published structures of the Caenorhabditis elegans glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl) in complex with the allosteric partial agonist ivermectin, which provided insights into the structure of a possibly open state of a eukaryotic Cys-loop receptor, the basis for anion selectivity and channel block, and the mechanism by which ivermectin and related molecules stabilize the open state and potentiate neurotransmitter binding. However, there remain unanswered questions about the mechanism of channel opening and closing, the location and nature of the shut ion channel gate, the transitions between the closed/resting, open/activated and closed/desensitized states, and the mechanism by which conformational changes are coupled between the extracellular, orthosteric agonist binding domain and the transmembrane, ion channel domain. Here we present two conformationally distinct structures of C. elegans GluCl in the absence of ivermectin. Structural comparisons reveal a quaternary activation mechanism arising from rigid-body movements between the extracellular and transmembrane domains and a mechanism for modulation of the receptor by phospholipids.},

We report the occurrence of a cholesterol recognition motif, here coined "CARC", in the transmembrane regions of AChR subunits that bear extensive contact with the surrounding lipid, and are thus optimally suited to convey cholesterol-mediated signaling from the latter. Three cholesterol molecules could be docked on the transmembrane segments of each AChR subunit, rendering a total of 15 cholesterol molecules per AChR molecule. The CARC motifs contribute each with an energy of interaction between 35 and 52 kJ.mol(-1), adding up to a total of about 200 kJ.mol(-1) per receptor molecule, i.e. ∼40{\%} of the lipid solvation free energy/ AChR molecule. The CARC motif is remarkably conserved along the phylogenetic scale, from prokaryotes to human, suggesting that it could be responsible for some of the above structural/functional properties of the AChR.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses a strategy to identify, in the primary structure of channel proteins, segments that determine the functional characteristics of the protein. Amphipathic $\alpha$-helical segments are identified in the primary structure using secondary structure prediction algorithms. Segments are selected based on sequence similarity between members of a superfamily of channel proteins. Synthesis of the four-helix bundle protein is accomplished by a two-step procedure: the template molecule is synthesized using orthogonal lysine side-chain protection followed by the simultaneous assembly of peptide blocks. Oligomeric clusters of amphipathic $\alpha$-helices, whether self-assembled in the lipid bilayer or covalently attached to a template molecule in a four-helix bundle configuration, form ionic channels in bilayers. The evidence that fundamental pore properties may be reproduced within a bundle of $\alpha$-helices representing selected sequences from the primary structure of a channel protein lends credence to the notion that a cluster of amphipathic $\alpha$-helices constitutes a general pore-forming motif for channel proteins. {\textcopyright} 1992, Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The ionotropic 5HT(3) receptor was expressed in transiently transfected mammalian cells, yielding an unprecedented high concentration of up to 12 million receptors per cell. Receptor traffic in the plasma membrane of live cells was observed continuously over 24 h by fluorescence scanning confocal microscopy. This was possible by using 5HT(3) receptor-specific fluorescent ligands with high binding affinity and low off-rate to pulse label receptors at any time after appearance on the cell surface, and label subsequently those receptors expressed later by another, spectrally distinguishable, high-affinity fluorescent ligand. Having reached a critical cell surface concentration of approximately 3000 receptors/microm(2), the receptors started to aggregate in patches with a 4-fold increased surface concentration. The clusters were constantly delivered from a pool of freshly expressed receptors isotropically distributed within the basolateral region of the cell membrane. From there, they migrated to and accumulated on the apical cell surface approximately 9 h after transfection. Individual clusters grew until they reached a critical size of 1-2 microm when they merged to form with 3-5 microm large macroclusters. Clustered receptors were immobile on the minute time scale but always coexisted with monomeric receptors in the regions surrounding the clusters as revealed by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Because the receptor density of 12 000 receptors/microm(2) in the patches is as high as that found in two-dimensional crystals of certain membrane proteins, such patches might be a proper source for direct crystallization of membrane proteins without prior purification.},

abstract = {The human $\alpha$7 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene (CHRNA7) is a candidate gene for schizophrenia and an important drug target for cognitive deficits in the disorder. Activation of the $\alpha$7*nAChR, results in opening of the channel and entry of mono- and divalent cations, including Ca2+, that presynaptically participates to neurotransmitter release and postsynaptically to down-stream changes in gene expression. Schizophrenic patients have low levels of $\alpha$7*nAChR, as measured by binding of the ligand [125I]-$\alpha$-bungarotoxin (I-BTX). The structure of the gene, CHRNA7, is complex. During evolution, CHRNA7 was partially duplicated as a chimeric gene (CHRFAM7A), which is expressed in the human brain and elsewhere in the body. The association between a 2 bp deletion in CHRFAM7A and schizophrenia suggested that this duplicate gene might contribute to cognitive impairment. To examine the putative contribution of CHRFAM7A on receptor function, co-expression of $\alpha$7 and the duplicate genes was carried out in cell lines and Xenopus oocytes. Expression of the duplicate alone yielded protein expression but no functional receptor and co-expression with $\alpha$7 caused a significant reduction of the amplitude of the ACh-evoked currents. Reduced current amplitude was not correlated with a reduction of I-BTX binding, suggesting the presence of non-functional (ACh-silent) receptors. This hypothesis is supported by a larger increase of the ACh-evoked current by the allosteric modulator 1-(5-chloro-2,4-dimethoxy-phenyl)-3-(5-methyl-isoxazol-3- yl)-urea (PNU-120596) in cells expressing the duplicate than in the control. These results suggest that CHRFAM7A acts as a dominant negative modulator of CHRNA7 function and is critical for receptor regulation in humans. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Serotonin type 3 (5-HT(3)) receptors are pentameric ion channels belonging to the superfamily of Cys-loop receptors. Receptor activation either leads to fast excitatory responses or modulation of neurotransmitter release depending on their neuronal localisation. 5-HT(3) receptors are known to be expressed in the central nervous system in regions involved in the vomiting reflex, processing of pain, the reward system, cognition and anxiety control. In the periphery they are present on a variety of neurons and immune cells. 5-HT(3) receptors are known to be involved in emesis, pain disorders, drug addiction, psychiatric and GI disorders. Progress in molecular genetics gives direction to personalised medical strategies for treating complex diseases such as psychiatric and functional GI disorders and unravelling individual drug responses in pharmacogenetic approaches. Here we discuss the molecular basis of 5-HT(3) receptor diversity at the DNA and protein level, of which our knowledge has greatly extended in the last decade. We also evaluate their role in health and disease and describe specific case-control studies addressing the involvement of polymorphisms of 5-HT3 subunit genes in complex disorders and responses to drugs. Furthermore, we focus on the actual state of the pharmacological knowledge concerning not only classical 5-HT(3) antagonists--the setrons--but also compounds of various substance classes targeting 5-HT(3) receptors such as anaesthetics, opioids, cannabinoids, steroids, antidepressants and antipsychotics as well as natural compounds derived from plants. This shall point to alternative treatment options modulating the 5-HT(3) receptor system and open new possibilities for drug development in the future.},

abstract = {The structural and functional properties of reconstituted nicotinic acetylcholine receptor membranes composed of phosphatidyl choline either with or without cholesterol and/or phosphatidic acid have been examined to test the hypothesis that receptor conformational equilibria are modulated by the physical properties of the surrounding lipid environment. Spectroscopic and chemical labeling data indicate that the receptor in phosphatidylcholine alone is stabilized in a desensitized-like state, whereas the presence of either cholesterol or phosphatidic acid favors a resting-like conformation. Membranes that effectively stabilize a resting-like state exhibit a relatively large proportion of non-hydrogen-bonded lipid ester carbonyls, suggesting a relatively tight packing of the lipid head groups and thus a well ordered membrane. Functional reconstituted membranes also exhibit gel-to-liquid crystal phase transition temperatures that are higher than those of nonfunctional reconstituted membranes composed of phosphatidylcholine alone. Significantly, incorporation of the receptor into phosphatidic acid-containing membranes leads to a dramatic increase in both the lateral packing densities and the gel-to-liquid crystal phase transition temperatures of the reconstituted lipid bilayers. These results suggest a functional link between the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and the physical properties of phosphatidic acid-containing membranes that could underlie the mechanism by which this lipid preferentially enhances receptor function.},

Linkage did not substantially alter channel amplitude or channel open-duration. Linkage at the C terminus of alpha4 prevented AChR potentiation by 17-beta-estradiol by disruption of its binding site. Assembly of AChRs from concatamers was less efficient, but function was much more efficient than that of unlinked subunits. With both linked and free subunits, greater ACh-induced currents per surface AChR were observed with the (alpha4)3(beta2)2 stoichiometry than with the (alpha4)2(beta2)3 stoichiometry. The (alpha4)3(beta2)2 stoichiometry exhibited much lower ACh sensitivity. When concatamers were expressed alone, dipentameric AChRs were formed in which the (alpha4)2(beta2)3 pentamer was linked to the (alpha4)3(beta2)2 pentamer. Dipentamers were selectively expressed on the cell surface, whereas most monopentamers with dangling subunits were retained intracellularly. Coexpression of concatamers with monomeric beta2, beta4, or alpha4 subunits resulted in monopentamers, the stoichiometry of which was determined by the free subunit added. Linkage between the C terminus of beta2 and the N terminus of alpha4 favored formation of ACh-binding sites within the concatamer, whereas linkage between the C terminus of alpha4 and the N terminus of beta2 favored formation of ACh-binding sites between concatamers. These protein-engineering studies provide insight into the structure and function of alpha4beta2 AChRs, emphasizing the functional differences between alpha4beta2 AChRs of different stoichiometries.},

abstract = {Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was used to study the action of ethanol on the protein side chain motions of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAcChoR) in alkaline extracted membranes from Torpedo nobiliana. EPR spectra of the nAcChoR derivatized with maleimide spin label contain both strongly and weakly immobilized components. The rotational correlation time of the strongly immobilized component decreases by a factor of 2-3-fold with the addition of 1.6 M ethanol, while that of the weakly immobilized component is not significantly altered. EPR spectroscopy was also used to probe the lipid environment immediately surrounding the nAcChoR with stearic acid and phosphatidylcholine spin labeled at the fourteenth acyl carbons (14-SASL and 14-PCSL, respectively), and the steroid spin label androstanol (ASL). EPR spectra of these probes reveal a component corresponding to lipids that are motionally restricted by the receptor (annular lipids) in addition to a more fluid component arising from bulk lipid. Using spectral subtraction, the order of selectivity of these spin labels for the nAcChoR was determined to be ASL {\textgreater} or = 14-SASL {\textgreater} 14-PCSL. The estimated rotational correlation times of the high affinity 14-SASL and ASL probes ranged from approx. 20 to 35 ns. The correlation times of the lower affinity 14-PCSL were generally shorter than those for 14-SASL and ASL and ranged from about 10 to 25 ns. The addition of up to 0.9 M ethanol altered neither the affinity nor the mobility of the motionally restricted EPR component. This suggests that ethanol's actions on the nAcChoR are not mediated via changes at the lipid/protein interface near the center of the bilayer.},

abstract = {ELIC, the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel from Erwinia chrysanthemi, is a prototype for Cys-loop receptors. Here we show that acetylcholine is a competitive antagonist for ELIC. We determine the acetylcholine-ELIC cocrystal structure to a 2.9-{\AA} resolution and find that acetylcholine binding to an aromatic cage at the subunit interface induces a significant contraction of loop C and other structural rearrangements in the extracellular domain. The side chain of the pore-lining residue F247 reorients and the pore size consequently enlarges, but the channel remains closed. We attribute the inability of acetylcholine to activate ELIC primarily to weak cation-$\pi$ and electrostatic interactions in the pocket, because an acetylcholine derivative with a simple quaternary-to-tertiary ammonium substitution activates the channel. This study presents a compelling case for understanding the structural underpinning of the functional relationship between agonism and competitive antagonism in the Cys-loop receptors, providing a new framework for developing novel therapeutic drugs. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Using the crosstalk between the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and its lipid microenvironment as a paradigm, this short overview analyzes the occurrence of structural motifs which appear not only to be conserved within the nAChR family and contemporary eukaryotic members of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC) superfamily, but also extend to prokaryotic homologues found in bacteria. The evolutionarily conserved design is manifested in: 1) the concentric three-ring architecture of the transmembrane region, 2) the occurrence in this region of distinct lipid consensus motifs in prokaryotic and eukaryotic pLGIC and 3) the key participation of the outer TM4 ring in conveying the influence of the lipid membrane environment to the middle TM1-TM3 ring and this, in turn, to the inner TM2 channel-lining ring, which determines the ion selectivity of the channel. The preservation of these constant structural-functional features throughout such a long phylogenetic span likely points to the successful gain-of-function conferred by their early acquisition. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Lipid-protein interactions.},

abstract = {Why agonist-induced activation of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAcChoR) fails completely in the absence of cholesterol is unknown. Affinity-purified nAcChoRs from Torpedo reconstituted into 1,2-dioleoyl-sn- glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine/1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate/steroid bilayers at mole ratios of 58:12:30 were used to distinguish between three regions of the membrane where cholesterol might act: the lipid bilayer, the lipid-protein interface, or sites within the protein itself. In the bilayer, the role of fluidity has been ruled out and certain neutral lipids can substitute for cholesterol [C. Sunshine, MG. McNamee, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1191 (1994) 59-64]; therefore, we first tested the hypothesis that flip-flop of cholesterol across the membrane is important; a plausible mechanism might be the relief of mechanical bending strain induced by a conformation change that expands the two leaflets of the bilayer asymmetrically. Cholesterol analogs prevented from flipping by charged groups attached to the 3- position's hydroxyl supported channel opening, contrary to this hypothesis. The second hypothesis is that interstitial cholesterol binding sites exist deep within the nAcChoR that must be occupied for channel opening to occur. When cholesterol hemisuccinate was covalently 'tethered' to the glycerol backbone of phosphatidylcholine, channel opening was still supported. Thus, if there are functionally important cholesterol sites, they must be very close to the lipid-protein interface and might be termed periannular.},

abstract = {The serotonin 5-HT 3 receptor is a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC). It belongs to a large family of receptors that function as allosteric signal transducers across the plasma membrane 1,2 ; upon binding of neurotransmitter molecules to extracellular sites, the receptors undergo complex conformational transitions that result in transient opening of a pore permeable to ions. 5-HT 3 receptors are therapeutic targets for emesis and nausea, irritable bowel syndrome and depression 3. In spite of several reported pLGIC structures 4-8 , no clear unifying view has emerged on the conformational transitions involved in channel gating. Here we report four cryo-electron microscopy structures of the full-length mouse 5-HT 3 receptor in complex with the anti-emetic drug tropisetron, with serotonin, and with serotonin and a positive allosteric modulator, at resolutions ranging from 3.2 {\AA} to 4.5 {\AA}. The tropisetron-bound structure resembles those obtained with an inhibitory nanobody 5 or without ligand 9. The other structures include an 'open' state and two ligand-bound states. We present computational insights into the dynamics of the structures, their pore hydration and free-energy profiles, and characterize movements at the gate level and cation accessibility in the pore. Together, these data deepen our understanding of the gating mechanism of pLGICs and capture ligand binding in unprecedented detail. A decade after the structure of the Torpedo marmorata nicotinic acetylcholine receptor 10 (nAChR), the set of known pLGIC structures is rapidly expanding and reflects the diversity of this protein family. The structures share a conserved architecture, in which subunits are arranged around a central five-fold pseudo-symmetry axis. Together they have clarified details of ligand binding, selectivity and allosteric modulation. They have also revealed a complex landscape of confor-mations, raising questions of how to relate structures to the wealth of data that established the existence of multiple agonist-bound pre-active intermediate states 11-13 , of distinct open states 14 and of multiple desensitized states 15. Mouse homomeric 5-HT 3A receptors, with their entire intracellular domain (ICD), were solubilized with the detergent C12E9 and purified. We first performed cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) in the presence of the potent antagonist tropisetron, and obtained a 4.5 {\AA} structure (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Figs. 1, 2, Extended Data Table 1), hereafter referred to as T. T is globally similar to the structure previously solved by X-ray crystallography 5 (root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.6 {\AA}), the pore of which was shown by molecular dynamics to be occluded 16. Tropisetron fits in a peanut-shaped density present in the neurotransmitter pocket (Extended Data Fig. 3d-f). The ICD contains a region of about 60 residues, which is averaged out (also in the other reconstructions, see below) because of its intrinsic flexibility 1,2. T resembles the 4.5 {\AA} cryo-EM structure of the apo 5-HT 3 receptor 9 (r.m.s.d. of 1.15 {\AA}), with small differences in the lipid-exposed helices M3, MX and M4. We then sought to identify agonist-elicited conformations of the 5-HT 3 receptor, and performed cryo-EM imaging in the presence of serotonin. A first reconstruction presented heterogeneity in the membrane domain. Further focused 3D classification allowed two subsets of particles to be separated, which yielded reconstructions at 4.2 {\AA} and 4.1 {\AA} resolution, corresponding to two different conformations (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. 4). The maps offer a variable level of information: most side chains in the extracellular domain are resolved, whereas some parts of the transmembrane domain (TMD) do not have side-chain information and some have limited information in the main chain position (Extended Data Figs. 4c, 5), reflecting the receptor dynamics. In the two refined structures, the extracellular domains (ECDs) have undergone an equivalent transition from the T state and serotonin could be modelled in the neurotransmitter site, whereas the TMDs differed markedly (Fig. 2, Extended Data Fig. 6). We call the first structure I1 for intermediate 1 and the second structure F for full, on the basis of the extent of movements compared to the inhibited state. I1 exhibits only limited displacements in the upper part of M1 and M2, and a rearrangement of the M2-M3 loop (Supplementary Video 1). F is characterized by a pronounced reorganization of the transmem-brane helices, which can be described by a rigid-body movement of the four-helix bundle coupled to a rearrangement of M4 (and of M3 to a lesser extent) sliding along M1 and M2 (Supplementary Videos 2, 3). F also features a very dynamic ICD, beyond the intrinsically disordered region, in which model building was not possible even though the data showed incomplete densities for MX and M4 (Extended Data Fig. 4a-c). Finally, we collected a dataset in the presence of serotonin and trans-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-n-(pentan-3-yl)acrylamide (TMPPAA, a compound exhibiting agonist and positive allosteric modulator activity on the human receptor 17), a combination that yields weakly desensitizing currents (Extended Data Fig. 1f). From this dataset, we reconstructed a 3.2 {\AA} resolution structure (Extended Data Fig. 2d-g), which provides non-ambiguous side-chain information for nearly the entire receptor. The refined structure has an ECD conformation essentially equivalent to that of I1 and F. The membrane domain is similar to that of I1, albeit with a slightly more expanded top section and pore (Fig. 2). We call this structure I2 for intermediate 2. Serotonin can be unambiguously positioned in the neurotransmit-ter site of I2. It fits tightly within its binding pocket (Extended Data Fig. 3a-c) in an orientation consistent with functional and binding studies 1. Surrounded by obligatory aromatic residues (F199 and Y207 on the principal side, Y126 and W63 on the complementary side), it is positioned to form a cation-$\pi$ interaction with W156 and hydrogen bonds with the main chain of S155 and Y64. The C loop is positioned moderately inward relative to the inhibited conformations, its position locked by a salt bridge between D202 and R65. A hallmark of allosteric activation is the subunit-subunit rearrangement (Extended Data Fig. 3d), which affects the site volume and geometry. 8 N O V e M B e r 2 0 1 8 | V O L 5 6 3 | N A t U r e | 2 7 5},

abstract = {Ontologies and rules play a central role in the development of the Semantic Web. Recent research in this context focuses especially on highly scalable formalisms for the Web of Data, which may highly benefit from exploiting database technologies. In this paper, as a first step towards closing the gap between the Semantic Web and databases, we introduce a family of expressive extensions of Datalog, called Datalog±, as a new paradigm for query answering over ontologies. The Datalog± family admits existentially quantified variables in rule heads, and has suitable restrictions to ensure highly efficient ontology querying. We show in particular that Datalog± encompasses and generalizes the tractable description logic EL and the DL-Lite family of tractable description logics, which are the most common tractable ontology languages in the context of the Semantic Web and databases. We also show how stratified negation can be added to Datalog± while keeping ontology querying tractable. Furthermore, the Datalog± family is of interest in its own right, and can, moreover, be used in various contexts such as data integration and data exchange. It paves the way for applying results from databases to the context of the Semantic Web.},

@article{Pick2003,
abstract = {The ionotropic 5HT(3) receptor was expressed in transiently transfected mammalian cells, yielding an unprecedented high concentration of up to 12 million receptors per cell. Receptor traffic in the plasma membrane of live cells was observed continuously over 24 h by fluorescence scanning confocal microscopy. This was possible by using 5HT(3) receptor-specific fluorescent ligands with high binding affinity and low off-rate to pulse label receptors at any time after appearance on the cell surface, and label subsequently those receptors expressed later by another, spectrally distinguishable, high-affinity fluorescent ligand. Having reached a critical cell surface concentration of approximately 3000 receptors/microm(2), the receptors started to aggregate in patches with a 4-fold increased surface concentration. The clusters were constantly delivered from a pool of freshly expressed receptors isotropically distributed within the basolateral region of the cell membrane. From there, they migrated to and accumulated on the apical cell surface approximately 9 h after transfection. Individual clusters grew until they reached a critical size of 1-2 microm when they merged to form with 3-5 microm large macroclusters. Clustered receptors were immobile on the minute time scale but always coexisted with monomeric receptors in the regions surrounding the clusters as revealed by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Because the receptor density of 12 000 receptors/microm(2) in the patches is as high as that found in two-dimensional crystals of certain membrane proteins, such patches might be a proper source for direct crystallization of membrane proteins without prior purification.},
