abstract = {Cell membranes are comprised of multicomponent lipid and protein mixtures that exhibit a complex partitioning behavior. Regions of structural and compositional heterogeneity play a major role in the sorting and self-assembly of proteins, and their clustering into higher-order oligomers. Here, we use computer simulations and optical microscopy to study the sorting of transmembrane helices into the liquid-disordered domains of phase-separated model membranes, irrespective of peptide-lipid hydrophobic mismatch. Free energy calculations show that the enthalpic contribution due to the packing of the lipids drives the lateral sorting of the helices. Hydrophobic mismatch regulates the clustering into either small dynamic or large static aggregates. These results reveal important molecular driving forces for the lateral organization and self-assembly of transmembrane helices in heterogeneous model membranes, with implications for the formation of functional protein complexes in real cells.},

abstract = {Calcium-permeable neurotransmitter receptors are concentrated into structurally and biochemically isolated cellular compartments to localize calcium-mediated events during neurotransmission. The cytoplasmic membrane contains lipid microdomains called lipid rafts, which can gather into microscopically visible clusters, and thus the association of a particular protein with lipid rafts can result in its redistribution on the cell surface. The present study asks whether lipid rafts participate in the formation and maintenance of the calcium-permeable alpha7-subunit nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7nAChR) clusters found in somatic spines of ciliary neurons. Lipid rafts and alpha7nAChR become progressively colocalized within somatic spines during synaptogenesis. To determine whether these rafts are required for the maintenance of alpha7nAChR aggregates, cholesterol was extracted from dissociated ciliary neurons by treatment with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin. This treatment caused the dispersion of lipid rafts and the redistribution of alpha7nAChR into small clusters over the cell surface, suggesting that the integrity of lipid rafts is required to maintain the receptor clustering. However, lipid raft dispersion also caused the depolymerization of the F-actin cytoskeleton, which can also tether the receptor at specific sites. To assess whether interaction between rafts and alpha7nAChR is independent of F-actin filaments, the lipid raft patches were stabilized with a combination of the cholera toxin B subunit (CTX), which specifically binds to the raft component ganglioside GM1, and an antibody against CTX. The stabilized rafts were then treated with latrunculin-A to depolymerize F-actin. Under these conditions, large patches of CTX persisted and were colocalized with alpha7nAChR, indicating that the aggregates of receptors can be maintained independently of the underlying F-actin cytoskeleton. Moreover, it was found that the alpha7nAChR is resistant to detergent extraction at 4 degrees C and floats with the caveolin-containing lipid-rich fraction during density gradient centrifugation, properties that are consistent with a direct association between the receptor and the membrane microdomains.},

Our results show that DHA-PE induces phase separation into a DHA rich liquid crystalline (L$\alpha$) phase and a DHA poor gel (L$\beta$′) phase at overall DHA-PE concentrations as low as 0.1 mol{\%}. In addition, we find that the structure of the L$\beta$′ phase, from which the DHA-PE molecules are largely excluded, is modified in the phase-separated state at low DHA-PE concentrations, with a decrease in bilayer thickness of 1.34 nm for 0.1 mol{\%} at room temperature, compared to pure DPPC bilayers. This result is contrary to that seen in similar studies on mono-unsaturated lipids where an increase in bilayer thickness is observed. The surprising effect of such low DHA-PE concentrations on membrane structure may be important in understanding the role of highly polyunsaturated lipids in biological membrane-based structures and similar artificial surfactant systems.},

abstract = {Background: $\alpha$7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are widely distributed throughout the central nervous system and are reported to have neuroprotective properties. $\alpha$7 nAChRs are expressed on astrocytes, which are key regulators of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in several neurodegenerative diseases. However, the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of astroglial $\alpha$7 nAChRs are not well studied. Therefore, we evaluated the role of astroglial $\alpha$7 nAChR activation in neuroinflammation. Methods: Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of $\alpha$7 nAChR activation were evaluated in an in vitro mouse model of neuroinflammation using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in primary astrocyte cultures. $\alpha$7 nAChR anti-inflammatory effects on the NF-$\kappa$B pathway were evaluated using ELISA, gene expression analysis, immunofluorescence, and western blotting. Antioxidant effect of $\alpha$7 nAChR activation on expression profiles of canonical Nrf2 target genes was examined by quantitative PCR and western blotting. The role of the Nrf2 pathway in $\alpha$7 nAChR-mediated anti-inflammatory response was evaluated using Nrf2 knockout astrocytes. Brain ex vivo NF-$\kappa$B luciferase signals were evaluated after treatment with an $\alpha$7 nAChR agonist in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-injected NF-$\kappa$B luciferase reporter mouse model. Results: Astrocytes treated with the $\alpha$7 nAChR partial agonist (GTS21) showed significantly reduced LPS-mediated secretion of inflammatory cytokines and this effect was reversed by the $\alpha$7 nAChR antagonist methyllycaconitine (MLA) and by knockdown of $\alpha$7 nAChR expression with a short hairpin RNA. Further, $\alpha$7 nAChR activation blocked LPS-mediated NF-$\kappa$B nuclear translocation indicating that the observed anti-inflammatory effect may be mediated through inhibition of the NF-$\kappa$B pathway. Treatment with GTS21 also upregulated canonical Nrf2 antioxidant genes and proteins suggesting antioxidant properties of $\alpha$7 nAChR in astrocytes. Using an astrocyte conditioned media approach, we demonstrated reduction in neuronal apoptosis when astrocytes were pretreated with GTS21. Finally, in an in vivo neuroinflammation model using LPS in NF-$\kappa$B luciferase reporter mice, we demonstrated reduction in LPS-induced NF-$\kappa$B activity and pro-inflammatory cytokines with GTS21 treatment in brain tissue. Conclusion: Our results suggest that activating astroglial $\alpha$7 nAChRs may have a role in neuroprotection by decreasing inflammation and oxidative stress, and therefore could have therapeutic implication for disease modifying treatments of neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {Certain types of nonpsychoactive cannabinoids can potentiate glycine receptors (GlyRs), an important target for nociceptive regulation at the spinal level. However, little is known about the potential and mechanism of glycinergic cannabinoids for chronic pain treatment. We report that systemic and intrathecal administration of cannabidiol (CBD), a major nonpsychoactive component of marijuana, and its modified derivatives significantly suppress chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain without causing apparent analgesic tolerance in rodents. The cannabinoids significantly potentiate glycine currents in dorsal horn neurons in rat spinal cord slices. The analgesic potency of 11 structurally similar cannabinoids is positively correlated with cannabinoid potentiation of the $\alpha$3 GlyRs. In contrast, the cannabinoid analgesia is neither correlated with their binding affinity for CB1 and CB2 receptors nor with their psychoactive side effects. NMR analysis reveals a direct interaction between CBD and S296 in the third transmembrane domain of purified $\alpha$3 GlyR. The cannabinoid-induced analgesic effect is absent in mice lacking the $\alpha$3 GlyRs. Our findings suggest that the $\alpha$3 GlyRs mediate glycinergic cannabinoid-induced suppression of chronic pain. These cannabinoids may represent a novel class of therapeutic agents for the treatment of chronic pain and other diseases involving GlyR dysfunction.},

abstract = {Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (n ACh Rs) are members of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel superfamily that play important roles in the control of neurotransmitter release in the central and peripheral nervous system. These receptors are important therapeutic targets for the development of drugs against a number of mental health disorders and for marketed smoking cessation aids. Unfortunately, drug discovery has been hampered by difficulties in obtaining sufficiently selective compounds. Together with functional complexity of the receptors, this has made it difficult to obtain drugs with sufficiently high-target to off-target affinity ratios. The recent and ongoing progress in structural studies holds promise to help understand structure-function relationships of n ACh R drugs at the atomic level. This will undoubtedly lead to the design of more efficient drugs with fewer side effects. As a high-resolution structure of a n ACh R is yet to be determined, structural studies are to a large extent based on acetylcholine-binding proteins ( ACh BPs) that despite low overall sequence identity display a high degree of conservation of overall structure and amino acids at the ligand-binding site. Further, ACh BPs reproduce relative binding affinities of ligands at n ACh Rs. Over the past decade, ACh BPs have been used extensively as models for n ACh Rs and have aided the understanding of drug receptor interactions at n ACh Rs significantly. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {The glycine receptor is a member of the Cys-loop receptor superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels and is implicated as a possible therapeutic target for the treatment of diseases such as alcoholism and inflammatory pain. In humans, four glycine receptor subtypes ($\alpha$1, $\alpha$2, $\alpha$3, and $\beta$) co-assemble to form pentameric channel proteins as either $\alpha$ homomers or $\alpha$$\beta$ heteromers. To date, few agents have been identified that can selectively modulate the glycine receptor, especially those possessing subtype specificity. We used a cell-based method of phage display panning, coupled with two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology in Xenopus laevis oocytes, to identify novel heptapeptide modulators of the $\alpha$1$\beta$ glycine receptor. This involved a panning procedure in which the phage library initially underwent subtractive panning against Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293 cells expressing alternative glycine receptor subtypes before panning the remaining library over HEK 293 cells expressing the target, the $\alpha$1$\beta$ glycine receptor. Peptides were identified that act with selectivity on $\alpha$1$\beta$ and $\alpha$3$\beta$, compared to $\alpha$2$\beta$, glycine receptors. In addition, peptide activity at the glycine receptor decreased when zinc was chelated by tricine, similar to previous observations of a decrease in ethanol's enhancing actions at the receptor in the absence of zinc. Comparisons of the amino acid sequences of heptapeptides capable of potentiating glycine receptor function revealed several consensus sequences that may be predictive of a peptide's enhancing ability.},

abstract = {Serotonin type 3 (5-HT(3)) receptors are pentameric ion channels belonging to the superfamily of Cys-loop receptors. Receptor activation either leads to fast excitatory responses or modulation of neurotransmitter release depending on their neuronal localisation. 5-HT(3) receptors are known to be expressed in the central nervous system in regions involved in the vomiting reflex, processing of pain, the reward system, cognition and anxiety control. In the periphery they are present on a variety of neurons and immune cells. 5-HT(3) receptors are known to be involved in emesis, pain disorders, drug addiction, psychiatric and GI disorders. Progress in molecular genetics gives direction to personalised medical strategies for treating complex diseases such as psychiatric and functional GI disorders and unravelling individual drug responses in pharmacogenetic approaches. Here we discuss the molecular basis of 5-HT(3) receptor diversity at the DNA and protein level, of which our knowledge has greatly extended in the last decade. We also evaluate their role in health and disease and describe specific case-control studies addressing the involvement of polymorphisms of 5-HT3 subunit genes in complex disorders and responses to drugs. Furthermore, we focus on the actual state of the pharmacological knowledge concerning not only classical 5-HT(3) antagonists--the setrons--but also compounds of various substance classes targeting 5-HT(3) receptors such as anaesthetics, opioids, cannabinoids, steroids, antidepressants and antipsychotics as well as natural compounds derived from plants. This shall point to alternative treatment options modulating the 5-HT(3) receptor system and open new possibilities for drug development in the future.},

This innovative area will promote further investigation into membranes and the development of new therapies with molecules that target the cell membrane. Due to the prominent roles of membranes in the cells' physiology and the paucity of therapeutic approaches based on the regulation of the lipids they contain, it is expected that membrane lipid therapy will provide new treatments for numerous pathologies.

Diagnosis of Alzheimer-type disease was based on the presence of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in post-mortem sections. Several highly significant and specific differences were observed between the two groups. Adrenic acid (22:4 n-6) was three to four times higher in the grey matter but lower in the white matter in each of the three regions in the Alzheimer brains than in the control group. These alterations were compensated by reciprocal changes in 18:0 in the grey matter and 16:1 fatty acids in the white matter. There was no significant difference in the proportion of other fatty acids, including those of the n-6 and n-3 series, in either the grey or the white matter of any of the three regions of the two groups, except for a higher proportion of 22:6 n-3 in the parietal white matter in the Alzheimer patients. There was no significant relationship between the levels of the individual fatty acids and age at death. It is suggested that the alterations in the fatty acid composition observed in the brains of Alzheimer patients may be caused by an aberration in the system by which essential fatty acids are transported into the brain},

abstract = {Fatty acid differences, including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) have been shown in the brains of Alzheimer's patients (AD) as compared with normal age-matched individuals. Furthermore, low serum DHA is a significant risk factor for the development of AD. The relative concentration of DHA and other fatty acids, however, in the plasma of AD patients compared with patients with other kinds of dementias (other dementias; OD), patients who are cognitively impaired but nondemented (CIND), or normal patients is not known. In this study we analyzed the total phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) fractions of plasma from patients diagnosed with AD, OD, or CIND and compared them with a group of elderly control subjects with normal cognitive functioning. Plasma phospholipid and PC levels of 20:5n-3, DHA, total n-3 fatty acids, and the n-3/n-6 ratio were lower in the AD, OD, and CIND groups. Plasma phospholipid 24:0 was lower in the AD, OD, and CIND groups as compared with the group of control patients, and total n-6 fatty acid levels were higher in the AD and CIND groups only. In the plasma PE fraction, levels of 20:5n-3, DHA, and the total n-3 fatty acid levels were significantly lower in the AD, OD, and CIND groups. DHA levels were lower in the lysoPC fraction of CIND individuals only. There were no other differences in the fatty acid compositions of the different phospholipid fractions. Therefore, in AD, OD, and CIND individuals, low levels of n-3 fatty acids in the plasma may be a risk factor for cognitive impairment and/or dementia. Interestingly, a decreased level of plasma DHA was not limited to the AD patients but appears to be common in cognitive impairment with aging},

abstract = {J. Neurochem. (2012) 122, 427443. Abstract Dietary lipids modify brain fatty acid profile, but evidence of their direct effect on neuronal function is sparse. The enthorinal cortex (EC) neurons connecting to the hippocampus play a critical role in learning and memory. Here, we have exposed mice to diets based on canola:soybean oils (40 : 10, g/kg) or safflower : corn oils (25 : 25, g/kg) to investigate the relationship between the lipid profile of brain fatty acids and the intrinsic properties of EC neurons. Consumption of canola : soybean oil-enriched diet led to the increase of the monounsaturated fatty acid oleic acid and to a decrease of arachidonic acid in ethanolamine glycerophospholipids of the white matter. We also found an important rise in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) within ethanolamine glycerophospholipids and phosphatidylserine of gray matter. The canola:soybean oil treatment led to a shorter duration of action potential (-21{\%}), a reduction in the duration of postsynaptic response (-21{\%}) and increased firing activity (+43{\%}). Data from additional experiments with animals fed DHA alone or DHA with canola oil suggested that dietary monounsaturated fatty acid may have contributed to these effects on EC neuron physiology. Since neuronal function within the enthorhinal-hippocampal loop is critical to learning and memory processes, the present data may provide a functional basis for the beneficial cognitive effects of canola oil-based diets.},

Proton nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry are the main analytical platforms used for metabolic profiling, enabling detection and quantitation of a wide range of compounds of particular neuro-pharmacological and physiological relevance, including neurotransmitters, secondary messengers, structural lipids, as well as their precursors, intermediates and degradation products. Metabolic profiling is therefore particularly indicated for the study of central nervous system by probing metabolic and neurochemical profiles of the healthy or diseased brain, in preclinical models or in human samples. In this review, we introduce the analytical and statistical requirements for metabolic profiling. Then, we focus on key studies in the field of metabolic profiling applied to the characterization of animal models and human samples of central nervous system disorders. We highlight the potential of metabolic profiling for pharmacological and physiological evaluation, diagnosis and drug therapy monitoring of patients affected by brain disorders. Finally, we discuss the current challenges in the field, including the development of systems biology and pharmacology strategies improving our understanding of metabolic signatures and mechanisms of central nervous system diseases.},

abstract = {$\alpha$-synuclein is a small protein abundantly expressed in the brain and located in synaptic terminals. The conversion of $\alpha$-synuclein into oligomers and fibrils is the hallmark of a range of neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. $\alpha$-synuclein is disordered in solution but can adopt an $\alpha$-helical conformation when bound to lipid membranes. This lipid-protein interaction plays an important role in its proposed biological function, i.e., synaptic plasticity, but can also entail the aggregation of the protein. Both the chemical properties of the lipids and the lipid-to-protein-ratio have been reported to modulate the aggregation propensity of $\alpha$-synuclein. In this review, the influence of changes in the nature and levels of lipids on the aggregation propensity of $\alpha$-synuclein in vivo and in vitro will be discussed within a common general framework. In particular, while biophysical measurements and kinetic analyses of the time courses of $\alpha$-synuclein aggregation in the presence of different types of lipid vesicles allow a mechanistic dissection of the influence of the lipids on $\alpha$-synuclein aggregation, biological studies of cellular and animal models of Parkinson's disease allow the determination of changes in lipid levels and properties associated with the disease.},

Therefore, measures to prevent the mani-festation, and treatments to ameliorate the symptoms, of these disorders are in high demand. Brain lipids determine the localization and function of proteins in the cell membrane of neurons. Lipids may also act as neurotransmitters or other signalling molecules. The lipid composition of the brain can be influenced by nutrition, environmental factors, and by behavioural activity. Thus, lipids represent a target for preven-tive medicine of psychiatric disorders. Here we review how brain lipids contribute to normal behaviour and to major psychiatric disorders with the focus on phospholipids/fatty acids, sphingolipids, and endo-cannabinoids. Accumulating evidence suggests a crucial role for membrane forming and signalling lipids in the brain in the etiopathologies of depression, bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, and drug addiction. Lipids also represent potential preventive interventions for these psychiatric disorders by either targeted dietary supplementation or pharmacological manipulation of lipid regulating enzymes.},

abstract = {Acetylcholine (ACh) was one of the first neurotransmitters to be discovered and is one of the most important in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS). ACh is produced by the enzyme choline acetyltransferase and its actions are mediated through two types of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) — the G protein-coupled muscarinic AChRs and the nicotinic AChRs (nAChRs). The nAChRs are ligand-gated ion channels that are present in both the PNS (at the skeletal neuromuscular junction and in the autonomic nervous system) and the CNS. They are integral membrane proteins involved in the rapid 'phasic' effects of ACh under conditions of brief release of this neurotransmitter that produce high local concentrations. nAChRs can also respond to low ACh concentrations, and are the target of tonically released ACh and of systemically applied pharmacological agents, including nicotine. Typically, activation of brain nAChRs results in enhanced release of various key neurotrans-mitters, including dopamine, serotonin, glutamate and GABA ($\gamma$-aminobutyric acid). Knowledge of the atomic structure, functional organ-ization and conformational transitions of the nAChRs has recently progressed to the extent that these recep-tors are now among the most well understood allosteric membrane proteins (that is, proteins that mediate signal transduction between topographically distinct sites, through a conformational change) 1 . This makes them an exceptional model to investigate the molecular mecha-nisms of drug–receptor interactions 2–7 . The acute effect of ACh consists of the fast opening (microsecond to milli-second range) of a cationic channel that is permeable to Na + , K + and sometimes Ca 2+ ions. Of key importance for drug design, chronic exposure to ACh or nicotinic drugs causes a gradual decrease in the rate of this ionic response (100 ms to minutes), leading to a high-affinity, desensitized, closed state of the receptor 5 . Many of the clinically used drugs that target nAChRs are administered for months, resulting in long-term changes in receptor properties and/or number. Chronic exposure to nico-tine causes a striking increase, typically by twofold, in the total number of high-affinity receptors — a process termed upregulation 8 . There is considerable interest in modulating nAChRs to treat various nervous-system disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and tobacco addiction 9–11 . This article first examines recent advances in our understanding of the assembly, activity and con-formational transitions of the nAChR 5,12 , highlighting the relevance of these discoveries to the design of novel, improved drugs that target nAChRs.

Dysfunction in the lipid homeostasis in the brain could be a risk factor for the many types of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These neurodegenerative disorders are marked by extensive neuronal apoptosis, gliosis, and alteration in the differentiation, proliferation, and development of neurons. Sphingomyelin, a constituent of plasma membrane, as well as its primary metabolite ceramide acts as a potential lipid second messenger molecule linked with the modulation of various cellular signaling pathways. Excessive production of reactive oxygen species associated with enhanced oxidative stress has been implicated with these molecules and involved in the regulation of a variety of different neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders. Studies have shown that alterations in the levels of plasma lipid/cholesterol concentration may result to neurodegenerative diseases. Alteration in the levels of inflammatory cytokines and mediators in the brain has also been found to be implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. Although several mechanisms involved in neuronal apoptosis have been described, the molecular mechanisms underlying the correlation between lipid metabolism and the neurological deficits are not clearly understood.

abstract = {Membrane lipids are potent modulators of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) from Torpedo. Lipids influence nAChR function by both conformational selection and kinetic mechanisms, stabilizing varying proportions of activatable versus non-activatable conformations, as well as influencing the transitions between these conformational States. Of note, some membranes stabilize an electrically silent uncoupled conformation that binds agonist but does not undergo agonist-induced conformational transitions. The uncoupled nAChR, however, does transition to activatable conformations in relatively thick lipid bilayers, such as those found in lipid rafts. In this review, we discuss current understanding of lipid-nAChR interactions in the context of increasingly available high resolution structural and functional data. These data highlight different sites of lipid action, including the lipid-exposed M4 transmembrane $\alpha$-helix. Current evidence suggests that lipids alter nAChR function by modulating interactions between M4 and the adjacent transmembrane $\alpha$-helices, M1 and M3. These interactions have also been implicated in both the folding and trafficking of nAChRs to the cell surface.

They are oligomeric protein assemblies that convert a chemical signal into an ion flux through the postsynaptic membrane, but the molecular mechanism of gating ions has remained elusive. Here, we present atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of the prokaryotic channels from Gloeobacter violaceus (GLIC) and Erwinia chrysanthemi (ELIC), whose crystal structures are thought to represent the active and the resting states of pLGICs, respectively, and of the eukaryotic glutamate-gated chloride channel from Caenorhabditis elegans (GluCl), whose open-channel structure was determined complexed with the positive allosteric modulator ivermectin. Structural observables extracted from the trajectories of GLIC and ELIC are used as progress variables to analyze the time evolution of GluCl, which was simulated in the absence of ivermectin starting from the structure with bound ivermectin. The trajectory of GluCl with ivermectin removed shows a sequence of structural events that couple agonist unbinding from the extracellular domain to ion-pore closing in the transmembrane domain. Based on these results, we propose a structural mechanism for the allosteric communication leading to deactivation/activation of the GluCl channel. This model of gating emphasizes the coupling between the quaternary twisting and the opening/closing of the ion pore and is likely to apply to other members of the pLGIC family.},

abstract = {The squid has been the most studied cephalopod, and it has served as a very useful model for investigating the events associated with nerve impulse generation and synaptic transmission. While the physiology of squid giant axons has been extensively studied, very little is known about the distribution and function of the neurotransmitters and receptors that mediate inhibitory transmission at the synapses. In this study we investigated whether $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activates neurotransmitter receptors in stellate ganglia membranes. To overcome the low abundance of GABA-like mRNAs in invertebrates and the low expression of GABA in cephalopods, we used a two-electrode voltage clamp technique to determine if Xenopus laevis oocytes injected with cell membranes from squid stellate ganglia responded to GABA. Using this method, membrane patches containing proteins and ion channels from the squid's stellate ganglion were incorporated into the surface of oocytes. We demonstrated that GABA activates membrane receptors in cellular membranes isolated from squid stellate ganglia. Using the same approach, we were able to record native glutamate-evoked currents. The squid's GABA receptors showed an EC(50) of 98 $\mu$mol l(-1) to GABA and were inhibited by zinc (IC(50) = 356 $\mu$mol l(-1)). Interestingly, GABA receptors from the squid were only partially blocked by bicuculline. These results indicate that the microtransplantation of native cell membranes is useful to identify and characterize scarce membrane proteins. Moreover, our data also support the role of GABA as an ionotropic neurotransmitter in cephalopods, acting through chloride-permeable membrane receptors.},

  abstract={Lipid rafts are subdomains of the plasma membrane that contain high concentrations of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids. They exist as distinct liquid-ordered regions of the membrane that are resistant to extraction with nonionic detergents. Rafts appear to be small in size, but may constitute a relatively large fraction of the plasma membrane. While rafts have a distinctive protein and lipid composition, all rafts do not appear to be identical in terms of either the proteins or the lipids that they contain. A variety of proteins, especially those involved in cell signaling, have been shown to partition into lipid rafts. As a result, lipid rafts are thought to be involved in the regulation of signal transduction. Experimental evidence suggests that there are probably several different mechanisms through which rafts control cell signaling. For example, rafts may contain incomplete signaling pathways that are activated when a receptor or other required molecule is recruited into the raft. Rafts may also be important in limiting signaling, either by physical sequestration of signaling components to block nonspecific interactions, or by suppressing the intrinsic activity of signaling proteins present within rafts. This review provides an overview of the physical characteristics of lipid rafts and summarizes studies that have helped to elucidate the role of lipid rafts in signaling via receptor tyrosine kinases and G protein-coupled receptors.},

abstract = {SUMMARY The lipid composition of highly purified synaptosomal plasma membranes has been analyzed. The membranes contained cholesterol (0.158 mg per mg protein), phospholipids (0.714 mg per mg protein) and gangliosides (0.125 mg per mg protein) as major constituents while cerebrosides and sulphatides were present in only trace amounts. Analysis of the gangliosides by thin-layer chromatography showed that there was no selective enrichment of any individual type in the plasma membranes in relation to total brain. The major phospholipids were ethanolamine (34.2 {\%}), choline (41.6 {\%}) and serine (13.2 {\%}) phosphoglycerides. Inositol monophospho-glyceride (3.5 {\%}), sphingomyelin (5.1 {\%}) and lysolecithin (1.0 {\%}) were relatively minor components while phosphatidylglycerol was not present. Each phospholipid class showed a specific fatty acid composition which differed from that of the other phospholipids. This result extends the specific fatty acid compositions observed in grey matter and certain sub-fractions by other workers. In particular, choline phos-phoglycerides contained high levels of saturated fatty acids while large quantities of docosahexaenoic acid were present in ethanolamine and serine phosphoglycerides.},

  abstract={Cell membranes contain a large number of different lipid species. Such a multicomponent mixture exhibits a complex phase behavior with regions of structural and compositional heterogeneity. Especially domains formed in ternary mixtures, composed of saturated and unsaturated lipids together with cholesterol, have received a lot of attention as they may resemble raft formation in real cells. Here we apply a simulation model to assess the molecular nature of these domains at the nanoscale, information that has thus far eluded experimental determination. We are able to show the spontaneous separation of a saturated phosphatidylcholine {(PC)/unsaturated} {PC/cholesterol} mixture into a liquid-ordered and a liquid-disordered phase with structural and dynamic properties closely matching experimental data. The near-atomic resolution of the simulations reveals remarkable features of both domains and the boundary domain interface. Furthermore, we predict the existence of a small surface tension between the monolayer leaflets that drives registration of the domains. At the level of molecular detail, raft-like lipid mixtures show a surprising face with possible implications for many cell membrane processes.},

  abstract={The ability of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor {(nAChR)} to undergo conformational transitions is exquisitely sensitive to its surrounding lipid environment. Previous work has highlighted a conformational selection mechanism, whereby different lipids stabilize different proportions of activatable resting versus nonactivatable conformations. In the absence of anionic lipids and cholesterol, the {nAChR} adopts an uncoupled conformation, which binds agonist with resting state–like affinity but does not usually undergo agonist-induced conformational transitions. Very slow (minutes to hours) transitions from uncoupled to coupled (resting, open and/or desensitized) conformations, however, can occur in membranes with relatively thick hydrophobic cores. Increasing membrane hydrophobic thickness 'awakens' uncoupled {nAChRs} by reducing the large activation energy barrier (or barriers) leading to coupled states, thus allowing conformational transitions to occur on an experimentally tractable timescale. Lipids shape activity by modulating the relative proportions of activatable versus nonactivatable conformations and by controlling the transitions between uncoupled and coupled conformations.},

J Mol Biol 346:967-989]. Purified {nAChR} must be reconstituted in a mixture containing cholesterol to function. Proposed modes of interaction between cholesterol and the protein range from specific binding to indirect membrane-mediated mechanisms. However, the underlying cause of {nAChR} sensitivity to cholesterol remains controversial, in part because the vast majority of functional studies were conducted before a medium resolution structure was reported. We show that the {nAChR} contains internal sites capable of containing cholesterol, whose occupation stabilizes the protein structure. We detect sites at the protein-lipid interface as conventionally predicted from functional data, as well as deeply buried sites that are not usually considered. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that occupation of both superficial and deeply buried sites most effectively preserves the experimental structure; the structure collapses in the absence of bound cholesterol. In particular, we find that bound cholesterol directly supports contacts between the agonist-binding domain and the pore that are thought to be essential for activation of the receptor. These results likely apply to those other ion channels within the Cys-loop superfamily that depend on cholesterol, such as the {GABA} receptor.},

Earlier studies demonstrated that {nAChRs} reconstituted into membranes containing phosphatidylcholine {(PC),} the anionic lipid phosphatidic acid {(PA),} and cholesterol {(CH)} are particularly effective at stabilizing the {nAChR} in the resting (closed) state that is capable of undergoing agonist-induced conformational transitions (i.e., functionality). The present studies demonstrate that (1) there is no obligatory requirement for {PC,} (2) increasing the {CH} content serves to increase the degree to which {nAChRs} are stabilized in the resting state, and this effect saturates at approximately 35 mol \% (molar lipid percentage), and (3) the effect of increasing levels of {PA} saturates at approximately 12 mol \% and in the absence of {PA} {nAChRs} are stabilized in the desensitized state (i.e., nonfunctional). Native Torpedo membranes contain approximately 35 mol \% {CH} but less than 1 mol \% {PA,} suggesting that other anionic lipids may substitute for {PA.} We report that (1) phosphatidylserine {(PS)} and phosphatidylinositol {(PI),} anionic lipids that are abundant in native Torpedo membranes, also stabilize the receptor in the resting state although with reduced efficacy (approximately 50-60\%) compared to {PA,} and (2) for {nAChRs} reconstituted into {PA/CH} membranes at different lipid-protein molar ratios, receptor functionality decreases rapidly below approximately 65 lipids per receptor. Collectively, these results are consistent with a functional requirement of a single shell of lipids surrounding the {nAChR} and specific anionic lipid- and sterol {(CH)-protein} interactions.},

Anesthetics inhibit the α4β2 {nAChR} at clinically relevant concentrations, but their binding sites in α4β2 remain unclear. The recently determined {NMR} structures of the α4β2 {nAChR} transmembrane {(TM)} domains provide valuable frameworks for identifying the binding sites. In this study, we performed solution {NMR} experiments on the α4β2 {TM} domains in the absence and presence of halothane and ketamine. Both anesthetics were found in an intra-subunit cavity near the extracellular end of the β2 transmembrane helices, homologous to a common anesthetic binding site observed in X-ray structures of anesthetic-bound {GLIC} {(Nury} et al., [32]). Halothane, but not ketamine, was also found in cavities adjacent to the common anesthetic site at the interface of α4 and β2. In addition, both anesthetics bound to cavities near the ion selectivity filter at the intracellular end of the {TM} domains. Anesthetic binding induced profound changes in protein conformational exchanges. A number of residues, close to or remote from the binding sites, showed resonance signal splitting from single to double peaks, signifying that anesthetics decreased conformation exchange rates. It was also evident that anesthetics shifted population of two conformations. Altogether, the study comprehensively resolved anesthetic binding sites in the α4β2 {nAChR.} Furthermore, the study provided compelling experimental evidence of anesthetic-induced changes in protein dynamics, especially near regions of the hydrophobic gate and ion selectivity filter that directly regulate channel functions.},

In giant unilamellar vesicles {(GUVs)} prepared from ternary mixtures of dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine/sphingomyelin/cholesterol, a clear separation of liquid-disordered and sphingomyelin-enriched, liquid-ordered phases could be observed. This phase separation can lead to the fission of the liquid-ordered phase from the vesicle. Here we show that in cholesterol-containing {GUVs,} the phase separation can involve dynamic redistribution of lipids from one phase into another as a result of a cross-linking perturbation. We found that the molecular structure of a sterol used for the preparation of {GUVs} determines (i) its ability to induce phase separation and (ii) the curvature (positive or negative) of the formed liquid-ordered phase. As a consequence, the latter can pinch off to the outside or inside of the vesicle. Remarkably, some mixtures of sterols induce liquid-ordered domains exhibiting both positive and negative curvature, which can lead to a new type of budding behavior in {GUVs.} Our findings could have implications for the role of sterols in various cell-biological processes such as budding of secretory vesicles, endocytosis, or formation of multivesicular bodies.},

Lipid analysis revealed: (1) a decrease of the cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio mainly derived from a higher content of phospholipids; (2) an increase of phospholipid unsaturated fatty acids, especially C20:4 and C20:5, with ethanol concentration of 150–250 {mM;} (3) a decrease of lipid-bound sialic acid with ethanol concentrations of ≥5 {mM.} These results underline that sialoglycoconjugates are a more sensitive target of alcohol in comparison with other lipid components.

  abstract={Phase separation in biological membranes plays an important role in protein targeting and transmembrane signaling. Its occurrence in both membrane leaflets commonly gives rise to matching liquid or liquid-ordered domains in the opposing monolayers. The underlying mechanism of such co-localization is not fully understood. The decrease of the line tension around the thicker ordered domain constitutes an important driving force. Yet, robust domain coupling requires an additional energy source, which we have now identified as thermal undulations. Our theoretical analysis of elastic deformations in a lipid bilayer shows that stiffer lipid domains tend to distribute into areas with lower fluctuations of monolayer curvature. These areas naturally align in the opposing monolayers. Thus, coupling requires both membrane leafs to display a heterogeneity in splay rigidities. The heterogeneity may either originate from intrinsic lipid properties or be acquired by adsorption of peripheral molecules. Undulations and line tension act synergistically: the gain in energy due a minimized line tension is proportional to domain radius and thus primarily fuels the registration of smaller domains; whereas the energetic contribution of undulations increases with membrane area and thus primarily acts to coalesce larger domains.},

We have cloned the zebrafish nicotinic acetylcholine receptor {(nAChR)} subunits and expressed key {nAChR} subtypes in Xenopus oocytes including neuronal {(\&\#x3B1;4\&\#x3B2;2,} {\&\#x3B1;2\&\#x3B2;2,} {\&\#x3B1;3\&\#x3B2;4,} and {\&\#x3B1;7)} and muscle {(\&\#x3B1;1\&\#x3B2;1(b)\&\#x25B;\&\#x3B4;)} {nAChR.} Consistent with studies of mammalian {nAChR,} nicotine was relatively inactive on muscle-type receptors, having both low potency and efficacy. It had high efficacy but low potency for {\&\#x3B1;7} receptors, and the best potency and good efficacy for {\&\#x3B1;4\&\#x3B2;2} receptors. Cytisine, a key lead compound for the development of smoking cessation agents, is a full agonist for both mammalian {\&\#x3B1;7} and {\&\#x3B1;3\&\#x3B2;4} receptors, but a full agonist only for the fish {\&\#x3B1;7,} with surprisingly low efficacy for {\&\#x3B1;3\&\#x3B2;4.} The efficacy of cytisine for {\&\#x3B1;4\&\#x3B2;2} was somewhat greater than typically reported for mammalian {\&\#x3B1;4\&\#x3B2;2.} The ganglionic blocker mecamylamine was most potent for blocking {\&\#x3B1;3\&\#x3B2;4} receptors, least potent for {\&\#x3B1;7,} and roughly equipotent for the muscle receptors and the {\&\#x3B2;2-containing} {nAChR.} However, the block of {\&\#x3B2;2-containing} receptors was slowly reversible, consistent with effective targeting of these {CNS-type} receptors in vivo. Three prototypical {\&\#x3B1;7-selective} agonists, choline, tropane, and {4OH-GTS-21,} were tested, and these agents were observed to activate both fish {\&\#x3B1;7} and {\&\#x3B1;4\&\#x3B2;2} {nAChR.} Our data therefore indicate that while some pharmacological tools used in zebrafish may function as expected, others will not.},

  abstract={The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor {(AChR)} is in intimate contact with the lipids in its native membrane. Here we analyze the possibility that it is the intrinsic properties of the {AChR} that determine its partition into a given lipid domain. Torpedo {AChR} or a synthetic peptide corresponding to the {AChR} M4 segment (the one in closer contact with lipids) was reconstituted into "raft"-containing model membranes. The distribution of the {AChR} was assessed by Triton X-100 extraction in combination with fluorescence studies, and lipid analyses were performed on each sample. The influence of rapsyn, a peripheral protein involved in {AChR} aggregation, was studied. Raft-like domain aggregation was also studied using membranes containing the ganglioside {GM1} followed by {GM1} crosslinking. The {gammaM4} peptide displays a marked preference for raft-like domains. In contrast, {AChR} alone or in the presence of rapsyn or ganglioside aggregation exhibits no such preference for raft-like domains, but it does cause a significant reduction in the total amount of these domains. The results indicate that the distribution of the {AChR} in lipid domains cannot be due exclusively to the intrinsic physicochemical properties of the protein and that there must be an external signal in native cell membranes that directs the {AChR} to a specific membrane domain.},

Twelve subunits have been identified in vertebrates, and mutations of one are recognized in a rare form of human epilepsy. Mice with genetically manipulated neuronal {nAChR} subunits exhibit behavioral or autonomic phenotypes. Here, we report the first model of an acquired neuronal {nAChR} disorder and evidence for its pertinence to paraneoplastic neurological autoimmunity. Rabbits immunized once with recombinant α3 subunit (residues 1–205) develop profound gastrointestinal hypomotility, dilated pupils with impaired light response, and grossly distended bladders. As in patients with idiopathic and paraneoplastic autoimmune autonomic neuropathy, the severity parallels serum levels of ganglionic {nAChR} autoantibody. Failure of neurotransmission through abdominal sympathetic ganglia, with retention of neuronal viability, confirms that the disorder is a postsynaptic channelopathy. In addition, we found ganglionic {nAChR} protein in small-cell carcinoma lines, identifying this cancer as a potential initiator of ganglionic {nAChR} autoimmunity. The data support our hypothesis that immune responses driven by distinct neuronal {nAChR} subtypes expressed in small-cell carcinomas account for several lung cancer–related paraneoplastic disorders affecting cholinergic systems, including autoimmune autonomic neuropathy, seizures, dementia, and movement disorders.},

  abstract={Spinal muscular atrophy {(SMA)} is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by degeneration of motoneurons and skeletal muscle atrophy. In its most severe form, it leads to death before the age of 2 years. While primary degeneration of motor neurons is well established in this disease, and this results in neurogenic atrophy of skeletal muscle, we have previously reported evidence for a primary muscle defect. In this study, we used primary cultures of embryonic human skeletal muscle cells from patients with {SMA} and from controls to examine the effects of muscle fiber differentiation in the absence of a nerve component. Cultured {SMA} skeletal muscle cells are unable to fuse correctly to form multinuclear myotubes, the precursors of the myofibers. We also show that agrin-induced aggregates of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, one of the earliest steps of neuromuscular junction formation, cannot be visualized by confocal microscopy on cells from {SMA} patients. In binding experiments, we demonstrate that this lack of clustering is due to defective expression of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the myotubes of {SMA} patients whereas the affinity of -bungarotoxin for its receptor remains unchanged regardless of muscle cell type {(SMA} or control). These observations suggest that muscle cells from {SMA} patients have intrinsic abnormalities that may affect proper formation of the neuromuscular junction.},

Analogously, the postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor may be considered the quantum of fast chemical to electrical transduction. Our understanding of postsynaptic receptors began to develop about a hundred years ago with the demonstration that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve released acetylcholine and slowed the heart beat. During the past 50 years, advances in understanding postsynaptic receptors increased at a rapid pace, owing largely to studies of the acetylcholine receptor {(AChR)} at the motor endplate. The endplate {AChR} belongs to a large superfamily of neurotransmitter receptors, called Cys-loop receptors, and has served as an exemplar receptor for probing fundamental structures and mechanisms that underlie fast synaptic transmission in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Recent studies provide an increasingly detailed picture of the structure of the {AChR} and the symphony of molecular motions that underpin its remarkably fast and efficient chemoelectrical transduction.},

  abstract={Lipid rafts are nanoscopic assemblies of sphingolipids, cholesterol, and specific membrane proteins that contribute to lateral heterogeneity in eukaryotic membranes. Separation of artificial membranes into liquid-ordered {(Lo)} and liquid-disordered phases is regarded as a common model for this compartmentalization. However, tight lipid packing in Lo phases seems to conflict with efficient partitioning of raft-associated transmembrane {(TM)} proteins. To assess membrane order as a component of raft organization, we performed fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy with the membrane probes Laurdan and C-laurdan. First, we assessed lipid packing in model membranes of various compositions and found cholesterol and acyl chain dependence of membrane order. Then we probed cell membranes by using two novel systems that exhibit inducible phase separation: giant plasma membrane vesicles {[Baumgart} et al. (2007) Proc Natl Acad Sci {USA} 104:3165-3170] and plasma membrane spheres. Notably, only the latter support selective inclusion of raft {TM} proteins with the ganglioside {GM1} into one phase. We measured comparable small differences in order between the separated phases of both biomembranes. Lateral packing in the ordered phase of giant plasma membrane vesicles resembled the Lo domain of model membranes, whereas the {GM1} phase in plasma membrane spheres exhibited considerably lower order, consistent with different partitioning of lipid and {TM} protein markers. Thus, lipid-mediated coalescence of the {GM1} raft domain seems to be distinct from the formation of a Lo phase, suggesting additional interactions between proteins and lipids to be effective.},

Furthermore, the number of rapsyn-binding sites per receptor (a heteropentamer) has been controversial. Here, we show by cryoelectron tomography and subtomogram averaging of Torpedo postsynaptic membrane that receptors are connected by up to three rapsyn bridges, the minimum number required to form a {2D} network. Half of the receptors belong to rapsyn-connected groups comprising between two and fourteen receptors.

We discuss the biological relevance of such disulfide bridges. Using our models, we investigate cholesterol binding to intersubunit cavities of the {GABAAR} transmembrane domain.

Taken together, the models and atomistic simulations suggest a somewhat flexible binding mode, with several possible orientations.

  pages={64-67},
  number={1-3},
  abstract={Emerging concepts of membrane organization point to the compartmentalization of the plasma membrane into distinct lipid microdomains. This lateral segregation within cellular membranes is based on cholesterol–sphingolipid-enriched microdomains or lipid rafts which can move laterally and assemble into large-scale domains to create plasma membrane specialized cellular structures at specific cell locations. Such domains are likely involved in the genesis of the postsynaptic specialization at the neuromuscular junction, which requires the accumulation of acetylcholine receptors {(AChRs),} through activation of the muscle specific kinase {MuSK} by the neurotropic factor agrin and the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. We used {C2C12} myotubes as a model system to investigate whether agrin-elicited {AChR} clustering correlated with lipid rafts. In a previous study, using two-photon Laurdan confocal imaging, we showed that agrin-induced {AChR} clusters corresponded to condensed membrane domains: the biophysical hallmark of lipid rafts {[F.} {Stetzkowski-Marden,} K. Gaus, M. Recouvreur, A. Cartaud, J. Cartaud, Agrin elicits membrane condensation at sites of acetylcholine receptor clusters in {C2C12} myotubes, J. Lipid Res. 47 (2006) 2121–2133]. We further demonstrated that formation and stability of {AChR} clusters depend on cholesterol. We also reported that three different extraction procedures {(Triton} X-100, {pH} 11 or isotonic Ca++, Mg++ buffer) generated detergent resistant membranes {(DRMs)} with similar {cholesterol/GM1} ganglioside content, which are enriched in several signalling postsynaptic components, notably {AChR,} the agrin receptor {MuSK,} rapsyn and syntrophin. Upon agrin engagement, actin and actin-nucleation factors such as Arp2/3 and {N-WASP} were transiently recovered within raft fractions suggesting that the activation by agrin can trigger actin polymerization. Taken together, the present data suggest that {AChR} clustering at the neuromuscular junction relies upon a mechanism of raft coalescence driven by agrin-elicited actin polymerization.},

  abstract={The effects of negatively charged and neutral lipids on the function of the reconstituted nicotinic acetylcholine receptor from Torpedo californica were determined with two assays using acetylcholine receptor-containing vesicles: the ion flux response and the affinity-state transition. The receptor was reconstituted into three different lipid environments, with and without neutral lipids: (1) phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine; (2) phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidic acid; and (3) phosphatidylcholine/cardiolipin. Analysis of the ion flux responses showed that: (1) all three negatively charged lipid environments gave fully functional acetylcholine receptor ion channels, provided neutral lipids were added; (2) in each lipid environment, the neutral lipids tested were functionally equivalent to cholesterol; and (3) the rate of receptor desensitization depends upon the type of neutral lipid and negatively charged phospholipid reconstituted with the receptor. The functional effects of neutral and negatively charged lipids on the acetylcholine receptor are discussed in terms of protein-lipid interactions and stabilization of protein structure by lipids.},

  abstract={The effects of cholesterol on membrane bending modulus {K(C),} membrane thickness {D(HH),} the partial and apparent areas of cholesterol and lipid, and the order parameter S(xray) are shown to depend upon the number of saturated hydrocarbon chains in the lipid molecules. Particularly striking is the result that up to 40\% cholesterol does not increase the bending modulus {K(C)} of membranes composed of phosphatidylcholine lipids with two cis monounsaturated chains, although it does have the expected stiffening effect on membranes composed of lipids with two saturated chains. The B fluctuational modulus in the smectic liquid crystal theory is obtained and used to discuss the interactions between bilayers. Our {K(C)} results motivate a theory of elastic moduli in the high cholesterol limit and they challenge the relevance of universality concepts. Although most of our results were obtained at 30 degrees C , additional data at other temperatures to allow consideration of a reduced temperature variable do not support universality for the effect of cholesterol on all lipid bilayers. If the concept of universality is to be valid, different numbers of saturated chains must be considered to create different universality classes. The above experimental results were obtained from analysis of x-ray scattering in the low angle and wide angle regions.},

  abstract={Micropipette pressurization of giant bilayer vesicles was used to measure both elastic bending k(c) and area stretch {K(A)} moduli of fluid-phase phosphatidylcholine {(PC)} membranes. Twelve diacyl {PCs} were chosen: eight with two 18 carbon chains and degrees of unsaturation from one double bond {(C18:1/0,} C18:0/1) to six double bonds per lipid {(diC18:3),} two with short saturated carbon chains {(diC13:0,} {diC14:0),} and two with long unsaturated carbon chains {(diC20:4,} {diC22:1).} Bending moduli were derived from measurements of apparent expansion in vesicle surface area under very low tensions (0.001-0.5 {mN/m),} which is dominated by smoothing of thermal bending undulations. Area stretch moduli were obtained from measurements of vesicle surface expansion under high tensions (\&gt;0.5 {mN/m),} which involve an increase in area per molecule and a small-but important-contribution from smoothing of residual thermal undulations. The direct stretch moduli varied little (\&lt; +/-10\%) with either chain unsaturation or length about a mean of 243 {mN/m.} On the other hand, the bending moduli of saturated/monounsaturated chain {PCs} increased progressively with chain length from 0.56 x 10(-19) J for {diC13:0} to 1.2 x 10(-19) J for {diC22:1.} However, quite unexpectedly for longer chains, the bending moduli dropped precipitously to approximately 0.4 x 10(-19) J when two or more cis double bonds were present in a chain {(C18:0/2,} {diC18:2,} {diC18:3,} {diC20:4).} Given nearly constant area stretch moduli, the variations in bending rigidity with chain length and polyunsaturation implied significant variations in thickness. To test this hypothesis, peak-to-peak headgroup thicknesses h(pp) of bilayers were obtained from x-ray diffraction of multibilayer arrays at controlled relative humidities. For saturated/monounsaturated chain bilayers, the distances h(pp) increased smoothly from {diC13:0} to {diC22:1} as expected. Moreover, the distances and elastic properties correlated well with a polymer brush model of the bilayer that specifies that the elastic ratio {(k(c)/K(A))(1/2)} = (h(pp) - h(o))/24, where h(o) approximately 1 nm accounts for separation of the headgroup peaks from the deformable hydrocarbon region. However, the elastic ratios and thicknesses for {diC18:2,} {diC18:3,} and {diC20:4} fell into a distinct group below the correlation, which showed that poly-cis unsaturated chain bilayers are thinner and more flexible than saturated/monounsaturated chain bilayers.},

  abstract={The effects of both neutral and anionic lipids on the structure of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor {(nAChR)} have been probed using infrared difference spectroscopy. The difference between infrared spectra of the {nAChR} recorded using the attenuated total reflectance technique in the presence and absence of the neurotransmitter analog, carbamylcholine, exhibits a complex pattern of positive and negative bands that provides a spectral map of the structural changes that occur in the {nAChR} upon ligand binding and subsequent desensitization. This spectral map is essentially identical in difference spectra recorded from native, native alkaline-extracted, and affinity-purified {nAChR} reconstituted into either soybean asolectin or egg phosphatidylcholine membranes containing both neutral and anionic lipids. This result suggests both a similar structure of the {nAChR} and a similar resting to desensitized conformational change in each membrane environment. In contrast, difference spectra recorded from the {nAChR} reconstituted into egg phosphatidylcholine membranes lacking neutral and/or anionic lipids all exhibit an essentially identical pattern of band intensity variations, which is similar to the pattern of variations observed in difference spectra recorded in the continuous presence of the desensitizing local anesthetic, dibucaine. The difference spectra suggest that the main effect of both neutral and anionic lipids in a reconstituted egg phosphatidylcholine membrane is to help stabilize the {nAChR} in a resting conformation. In the absence of neutral and/or anionic lipids, the {nAChR} is converted into an alternate conformation that appears to be analogous to the local anesthetic-induced desensitized state. Significantly, the proportion of receptors found in the resting versus the putative desensitized state appears to be dependent upon the final lipid composition of the reconstituted membrane. A lipid-dependent modulation of the equilibrium between a channel-active resting and channel-inactive desensitized state may account for the modulations of {nAChR} activity that are observed in different lipid membranes.},

  abstract={In order to investigate experimentally inaccessible, molecular-level detail regarding interleaflet interaction in membranes, we have run an extensive series of coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of phase separated lipid bilayers. The simulations are motivated by differences in lipid and cholesterol composition in the inner and outer leaflets of biological membranes. Over the past several years, this phenomenon has inspired a series of experiments in model membrane systems which have explored the effects of lipid compositional asymmetry in the two leaflets. The simulations are directed at understanding one potential consequence of compositional asymmetry, that being regions of bilayers where liquid-ordered {(L(o))} domains in one leaflet are opposite liquid-disordered {(L(d))} domains in the other leaflet (phase asymmetry). The simulated bilayers are of two sorts: 1) Compositionally symmetric leaflets where each of the two leaflets contains an identical, phase separated {(L(o)/L(d))} mixture of cholesterol, saturated and unsaturated phospholipid; and 2) Compositionally asymmetric leaflets, where one leaflet contains a phase separated {(L(o)/L(d))} mixture while the other contains only unsaturated lipid, which on its own would be in the L(d) phase. In addition, we have run simulations where the lengths of the saturated lipid chains as well as the mole ratios of the three lipid components are varied. Collectively, we report on three types of interleaflet coupling within a bilayer. First, we show the effects of compositional asymmetry on acyl chain tilt and order, lipid rotational dynamics, and lateral diffusion in regions of leaflets that are opposite L(o) domains. Second, we show substantial effects of compositional asymmetry on local bilayer curvature, with the conclusion that phase separated leaflets resist curvature, while inducing large degrees of curvature in an opposing L(d) leaflet. Finally, in compositionally symmetric, phase separated bilayers, we find phase asymmetry (domain antiregistration) between the two leaflets occurs as a consequence of mismatched acyl chain-lengths in the saturated and unsaturated lipids.},

  abstract={Recently discovered bacterial homologues of eukaryotic pentameric ligand-gated ion channels, such as the Gloeobacter violaceus receptor {(GLIC),} are increasingly used as structural and functional models of signal transduction in the nervous system. Here we present a one-microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulation of the {GLIC} channel {pH} stimulated gating mechanism. The crystal structure of {GLIC} obtained at acidic {pH} in an open-channel form is equilibrated in a membrane environment and then instantly set to neutral {pH.} The simulation shows a channel closure that rapidly takes place at the level of the hydrophobic furrow and a progressively increasing quaternary twist. Two major events are captured during the simulation. They are initiated by local but large fluctuations in the pore, taking place at the top of the M2 helix, followed by a global tertiary relaxation. The two-step transition of the first subunit starts within the first 50 ns of the simulation and is followed at 450 ns by its immediate neighbor in the pentamer, which proceeds with a similar scenario. This observation suggests a possible two-step domino-like tertiary mechanism that takes place between adjacent subunits. In addition, the dynamical properties of {GLIC} described here offer an interpretation of the paradoxical properties of a permeable {A13'F} mutant whose crystal structure determined at 3.15 A shows a pore too narrow to conduct ions.},

Here we show that M4 interactions with the adjacent transmembrane {\&\#x3B1;} helices, M1 and M3, modulate {pLGIC} function. Enhanced M4 interactions promote channel function while ineffective interactions reduce channel function. The interface chemistry governs the intrinsic strength of {M4-M1/M3} inter-helical interactions, both influencing channel gating and imparting distinct susceptibilities to the potentiating effects of a lipid-facing M4 congenital myasthenic syndrome mutation.

  abstract={Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate fast chemical neurotransmission at the neuromuscular junction and have diverse signalling roles in the central nervous system. The nicotinic receptor has been a model system for cell-surface receptors, and specifically for ligand-gated ion channels, for well over a century. In addition to the receptors’ prominent roles in the development of the fields of pharmacology and neurobiology, nicotinic receptors are important therapeutic targets for neuromuscular disease, addiction, epilepsy and for neuromuscular blocking agents used during surgery. The overall architecture of the receptor was described in landmark studies of the nicotinic receptor isolated from the electric organ of Torpedo marmorata. Structures of a soluble ligand-binding domain have provided atomic-scale insights into receptor–ligand interactions, while high-resolution structures of other members of the pentameric receptor superfamily provide touchstones for an emerging allosteric gating mechanism. All available high-resolution structures are of homopentameric receptors. However, the vast majority of pentameric receptors (called Cys-loop receptors in eukaryotes) present physiologically are heteromeric. Here we present the X-ray crystallographic structure of the human α4β2 nicotinic receptor, the most abundant nicotinic subtype in the brain. This structure provides insights into the architectural principles governing ligand recognition, heteromer assembly, ion permeation and desensitization in this prototypical receptor class.},

Specifically, isoflurane binds persistently to three classes of sites in the {nAChR} transmembrane domain: (i) An isoflurane dimer occludes the pore, contacting residues identified by previous mutagenesis studies; analogous behavior is observed in {GLIC.} (ii) Several {nAChR} subunit interfaces are also occupied, in a site suggested by photoaffinity labeling and thought to positively modulate the receptor; these sites are not occupied in {GLIC.} (iii) Isoflurane binds to the subunit centers of both {nAChR} α chains and one of the {GLIC} chains, in a site that has had little experimental targeting. Interpreted in the context of existing structural and physiological data, the present {MD} results support a multisite model for the mechanism of receptor-channel modulation by anesthetics.},

  abstract={The intact Xenopus laevis oocyte is a useful model system for studying expressed water and solute transporters but suffers from a number of limitations, most notably large unstirred layers and other intracellular diffusion barriers. To overcome these, we have developed a method for isolating plasma membrane vesicles from oocytes. This approach facilitates more precise control of the intravesicular environment and virtually eliminates the problem of unstirred layers in kinetic experiments. The isolation procedure results in 50.6-fold enrichment of the plasma membrane marker alkaline phosphodiesterase compared with the homogenate. Markers of late endosomes/lysosomes and mitochondria were not enriched, and the endoplasmic reticulum was enriched only modestly. Permeabilities of native plasma membrane to water and urea were 8.1 x 10(-4) and 5.6 x 10(-7) cm/s, respectively, values that are sufficiently low to classify them as barrier membranes. Phospholipid analysis by mass spectrometry showed the membrane, not including cholesterol, to be rich in phosphatidylcholine (35.8 mole percent), sphingomyelin (25.8 mole percent), and phosphatidylinositol (6.8 mole percent). Cholesterol concentration was 20.7 mole percent. Membrane vesicles isolated from oocytes expressing aquaporin-1 exhibited fourfold higher water permeability in stopped-flow experiments. Oocytes expressing mouse urea transporter A3 {(UT-A3)} exhibited 7.5-fold faster phloretin-inhibitable urea transport compared with water-injected controls. There was no difference in water permeability between these membrane vesicles, suggesting that {UT-A3} is not a water carrier. In conclusion, we describe an improved method for the isolation of the oocyte plasma membrane that will allow the study of water and solute transport kinetics as well as substrate selectivity in heterologously expressed proteins.},

abstract = {We present a refined model of the membrane-associated Torpedo acetylcholine (ACh) receptor at 4 {\AA} resolution. An improved experimental density map was obtained from 342 electron images of helical tubes, and the refined structure was derived to an R-factor of 36.7{\%} (Rfree37.9{\%}) by standard crystallographic methods, after placing the densities corresponding to a single molecule into an artificial unit cell. The agreement between experimental and calculated phases along the helical layer-lines was used to monitor progress in the refinement and to give an independent measure of the accuracy. The atomic model allowed a detailed description of the whole receptor in the closed-channel form, including the ligand-binding and intracellular domains, which have not previously been interpreted at a chemical level. We confirm that the two ligand-binding $\alpha$ subunits have a different extended conformation from the three other subunits in the closed channel, and identify several interactions on both pairs of subunit interfaces, and within the $\alpha$ subunits, which may be responsible for their "distorted" structures. The ACh-coordinating amino acid side-chains of the $\alpha$ subunits are far apart in the closed channel, indicating that a localised rearrangement, involving closure of loops B and C around the bound ACh molecule, occurs upon activation. A comparison of the structure of the $\alpha$ subunit with that of AChBP having ligand present, suggests how the localised rearrangement overcomes the distortions and initiates the rotational movements associated with opening of the channel. Both vestibules of the channel are strongly electronegative, providing a cation-stabilising environment at either entrance of the membrane pore. Access to the pore on the intracellular side is further influenced by narrow lateral windows, which would be expected to screen out electrostatically ions of the wrong charge and size. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Solid-state NMR methods employing 2H NMR and geometric analysis of labeled alanines (GALA) were used to study the structure and orientation of the transmembrane $\alpha$-helical peptide acetyl-GWW(LA)8LWWA-amide (WALP23) in phosphatidylcholine (PC) bilayers of varying thickness. In all lipids the peptide was found to adopt a transmembrane $\alpha$-helical conformation. A small tilt angle of 4.5° was observed in di-18:1-PC, which has a hydrophobic bilayer thickness that approximately matches the hydrophobic length of the peptide. This tilt angle increased slightly but systematically with increasing positive mismatch to 8.2° in di-C12:0-PC, the shortest lipid used. This small increase in tilt angle is insufficient to significantly change the effective hydrophobic length of the peptide and thereby to compensate for the increasing hydrophobic mismatch, suggesting that tilt of these peptides in a lipid bilayer is energetically unfavorable. The tilt and also the orientation around the peptide axis were found to be very similar to the values previously reported for a shorter WALP19 peptide (GWW(LA)6LWWA). As also observed in this previous study, the peptide rotates rapidly around the bilayer normal, but not around its helix axis. Here we show that these properties allow application of the GALA method not only to macroscopically aligned samples but also to randomly oriented samples, which has important practical advantages. A minimum of four labeled alanine residues in the hydrophobic transmembrane sequence was found to be required to obtain accurate tilt values using the GALA method.},

abstract = {The synapse is a localized neurohumoral contact between a neuron and an effector cell and may be considered the quantum of fast intercellular communication. Analogously, the postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor may be considered the quantum of fast chemical to electrical transduction. Our understanding of postsynaptic receptors began to develop about a hundred years ago with the demonstration that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve released acetylcholine and slowed the heart beat. During the past 50 years, advances in under-standing postsynaptic receptors increased at a rapid pace, owing largely to studies of the acetyl-choline receptor (AChR) at the motor endplate. The endplate AChR belongs to a large superfamily of neurotransmitter receptors, called Cys-loop receptors, and has served as an exemplar receptor for probing fundamental structures and mechanisms that underlie fast synaptic transmission in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Recent studies provide an increasingly detailed picture of the structure of the AChR and the symphony of molecular motions that underpin its remarkably fast and efficient chemoelectrical transduction.},

The new version, coined the MARTINI force field, is parametrized in a systematic way, based on the reproduction of partitioning free energies between polar and apolar phases of a large number of chemical compounds. To reproduce the free energies of these chemical building blocks, the number of possible interaction levels of the coarse-grained sites has increased compared to those of the previous model. Application of the new model to lipid bilayers shows an improved behavior in terms of the stress profile across the bilayer and the tendency to form pores. An extension of the force field now also allows the simulation of planar (ring) compounds, including sterols. Application to a bilayer/cholesterol system at various concentrations shows the typical cholesterol condensation effect similar to that observed in all atom representations.},

abstract = {Transglutaminases (TGases; EC 2.3.2.13) are a family of enzymes that catalyze calcium-dependent covalent cross-linking of cellular proteins by establishing epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl)lysine isopeptide bonds. These covalent isopeptide bonds are of great physiological significance because they are highly resistant to proteolysis, denaturants, and reducing agents. Prior studies have demonstrated the presence of isopeptide bonds in the sheath and cuticle of filarial parasites, suggesting an important role for TGase-catalyzed reactions during the growth and development of filarial nematodes. Herein we report the identification and cloning of a cDNA encoding a TGase from the dog heartworm Dirofilaria immitis (DiTG). The DiTG expressed in Escherichia coli (recombinant DiTG) was able to catalyze calcium-dependent cross-linking reactions. The derived amino acid sequence of the DiTG cDNA (pDiTG) predicts a protein of 57.1 kDa and includes an N-terminal hydrophobic signal peptide. The pDiTG has no sequence similarity with any of the known TGases, but it has significant homology to protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and, particularly, to the PDI-related endoplasmic reticulum protein ERp60, a PDI isoform found in the lumen of endoplasmic reticulum. As predicted from the amino acid sequence homology, recombinant DiTG catalyzed the isomerization of intramolecular disulfide/sulfhydryl bonds in denatured RNase in vitro as effectively as did mammalian PDI. Conversely, purified PDI from bovine liver could catalyze protein cross-linking reactions in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. This report describes the dual catalytic activity of TGase and PDI in post- and/or cotranslational modification of newly synthesized proteins. These TGase-catalyzed posttranslational modifications may play a pivotal role in the synthesis of new cuticle during the growth and maturation of filarial parasites.},

abstract = {Hyperlipidemia is common in diabetic patients. While our understanding of lipid and lipoprotein me-tabolism in diabetes is incomplete, a pathophysiologic approach to this problem is presented. It is based on the recognition that diabetes is metabolically heterogeneous. Thus the roles of insulin deficiency, insulin resistance, obesity, and genetic factors are discussed in relation to their effects on lipoprotein production and catabolism. The most important defect in insulin-deficient subjects appears to be a defi-ciency of lipoprotein lipase, which is responsible for the removal of the triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. In non-insulin-dependent subjects there is evidence for a removal defect as well as, in some patients, for overproduction of VLDL-triglyceride. Cholesterol levels may be elevated and it is important to distin-guish between VLDL, LDL, and HDL as the causes for these increases. HDL-cholesterol levels may be increased in insulin-dependent subjects, whereas they may be decreased in obese non-insulin-dependent patients. Mild elevations of LDL-cholesterol may occur in inadequately controlled type I and II diabetic patients, while elevated VLDL may raise the serum cholesterol in addition to the triglyceride levels. The rationale for therapy is based on the complications of severe hypertriglyceridemia and the risk of occlu-sive atherosclerosis. Management is directed at improving glycemic control, altering dietary composi-tion, and reducing calories in obese patients. Improved glycemic control is effective in reducing triglyc-eride and cholesterol levels in insulin-deficient subjects. The response of the non-insulin-dependent diabetic patient to improved control may be complicated by associated obesity or familial hyperlipide-mia. The advantages and disadvantages of fat versus carbohydrate restriction in the diet are discussed. Finally, resistant hyperlipidemia may require drug therapy. Diabetic hyperlipidemia should be viewed as resulting from an interaction between the diabetic syndrome, the genetic background of the patient, and the environment, DIABETES CARE 4. -561-572, SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER i98i. A n association between hyperlipidemia and dia-betic ketoacidosis was first demonstrated by Bloor in 1916. 1 It has since been appreciated that blood lipids are fairly commonly elevated among ambulant diabetic patients. 2 " 6 In view of the predisposition for the development of atherosclerotic vascular disease in the diabetic, attention has been focused on lipid and lipoprotein levels and metabolism in diabetes. This review provides a pathophysiologic approach to the lipid abnormalities in dia-betes, and will stress the important metabolic differences be-tween type I (insulin-dependent) and type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes.

abstract = {The $\alpha$4$\beta$2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) has significant roles in nervous system function and disease. It is also a molecular target of general anesthetics. Anesthetics inhibit the $\alpha$4$\beta$2 nAChR at clinically relevant concentrations, but their binding sites in $\alpha$4$\beta$2 remain unclear. The recently determined NMR structures of the $\alpha$4$\beta$2 nAChR transmembrane (TM) domains provide valuable frameworks for identifying the binding sites. In this study, we performed solution NMR experiments on the $\alpha$4$\beta$2 TM domains in the absence and presence of halothane and ketamine. Both anesthetics were found in an intra-subunit cavity near the extracellular end of the $\beta$2 transmembrane helices, homologous to a common anesthetic binding site observed in X-ray structures of anesthetic-bound GLIC (Nury et al., [32]). Halothane, but not ketamine, was also found in cavities adjacent to the common anesthetic site at the interface of $\alpha$4 and $\beta$2. In addition, both anesthetics bound to cavities near the ion selectivity filter at the intracellular end of the TM domains. Anesthetic binding induced profound changes in protein conformational exchanges. A number of residues, close to or remote from the binding sites, showed resonance signal splitting from single to double peaks, signifying that anesthetics decreased conformation exchange rates. It was also evident that anesthetics shifted population of two conformations. Altogether, the study comprehensively resolved anesthetic binding sites in the $\alpha$4$\beta$2 nAChR. Furthermore, the study provided compelling experimental evidence of anesthetic-induced changes in protein dynamics, especially near regions of the hydrophobic gate and ion selectivity filter that directly regulate channel functions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A parallel message-passing implementation of a molecular dynamics (MD) program that is useful for bio(macro)molecules in aqueous environment is described. The software has been developed for a custom-designed 32-processor ring GROMACS (GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulation) with communication to and from left and right neighbours, but can run on any parallel system onto which a a ring of processors can be mapped and which supports PVM-like block send and receive calls. The GROMACS software consists of a preprocessor, a parallel MD and energy minimization program that can use an arbitrary number of processors (including one), an optional monitor, and several analysis tools. The programs are written in ANSI C and available by ftp (information: gromacs@chem.rug.nl). The functionality is based on the GROMOS (GROningen MOlecular Simulation) package (van Gunsteren and Berendsen, 1987; BIOMOS B.V., Nijenborgh 4, 9747 AG Groningen). Conversion programs between GROMOS and GROMACS formats are included. The MD program can handle rectangular periodic boundary conditions with temperature and pressure scaling. The interactions that can be handled without modification are variable non-bonded pair interactions with Coulomb and Lennard-Jones or Buckingham potentials, using a twin-range cut-off based on charge groups, and fixed bonded interactions of either harmonic or constraint type for bonds and bond angles and either periodic or cosine power series interactions for dihedral angles. Special forces can be added to groups of particles (for non-equilibrium dynamics or for position restraining) or between particles (for distance restraints). The parallelism is based on particle decomposition. Interprocessor communication is largely limited to position and force distribution over the ring once per time step. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

In its most severe form, it leads to death before the age of 2 years. While primary degeneration of motor neurons is well established in this disease, and this results in neurogenic atrophy of skeletal muscle, we have previously reported evidence for a primary muscle defect. In this study, we used primary cultures of embryonic human skeletal muscle cells from patients with SMA and from controls to examine the effects of muscle fiber differentiation in the absence of a nerve component. Cultured SMA skeletal muscle cells are unable to fuse correctly to form multinuclear myotubes, the precursors of the myofibers. We also show that agrin-induced aggregates of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, one of the earliest steps of neuromuscular junction formation, cannot be visualized by confocal microscopy on cells from SMA patients. In binding experiments, we demonstrate that this lack of clustering is due to defective expression of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the myotubes of SMA patients whereas the affinity of alpha-bungarotoxin for its receptor remains unchanged regardless of muscle cell type (SMA or control). These observations suggest that muscle cells from SMA patients have intrinsic abnormalities that may affect proper formation of the neuromuscular junction.},

In this review, we focus on the PUFA modulation of membrane archi-tecture and its consequent effects on both T cell responses and antigen presentation. We first use data from in vitro and in vivo experiments to make the case that the immunosuppressive effects of PUFAs begin with membrane incorporation and modulation of lipid-protein lateral organization. This in turn inhibits downstream sig-naling mediated by T cell receptors and suppresses T cell activation and proliferation. Next, we review evidence for PUFA-mediated alteration of major histocompatibility complex class I and II surface expression and antigen presentation. We propose that PUFAs influ-ence the expression of major histocompatibility complex by altering its conformation, orientation, lateral organization, and trafficking, with consequences for recognition by effector T cells. Finally, we present data from model membrane studies to explain the physical principles that make PUFA acyl chains unique in modifying mem-brane lateral organization and protein function. An important con-cept to emerge from these studies is that PUFA acyl chains and cholesterol molecules are sterically incompatible. By applying this concept to the T cell activation and signaling model, mechanisms emerge by which PUFAs can modulate membrane lipid-protein lat-eral organization. Our data-based models show that membrane mod-ification of both effectors and targets is an important, often over-looked, mechanism of immunomodulation by PUFAs.},

abstract = {Plasma membranes of cells are asymmetric in both lipid and protein composition. The mechanism by which proteins on both sides of the membrane colocalize during signaling events is unknown but may be due to the induction of inner leaflet domains by the outer leaflet. Here we show that liquid domains form in asymmetric Montal-Mueller planar bilayers in which one leaflet's composition would phase-separate in a symmetric bilayer and the other's would not. Equally important, by tuning the lipid composition of the second leaflet, we are able to suppress domains in the first leaflet. When domains are present in asymmetric membranes, each leaflet contains regions of three distinct lipid compositions, implying strong interleaflet interactions. Our results show that mechanisms of domain induction between the outer and inner leaflets of cell plasma membranes do not necessarily require the participation of membrane proteins. Based on these findings, we suggest mechanisms by which cells could actively regulate protein function by modulating local lipid composition or interleaflet interactions.},

J Mol Biol 346:967-989]. Purified nAChR must be reconstituted in a mixture containing cholesterol to function. Proposed modes of interaction between cholesterol and the protein range from specific binding to indirect membrane-mediated mechanisms. However, the underlying cause of nAChR sensitivity to cholesterol remains controversial, in part because the vast majority of functional studies were conducted before a medium resolution structure was reported. We show that the nAChR contains internal sites capable of containing cholesterol, whose occupation stabilizes the protein structure. We detect sites at the protein-lipid interface as conventionally predicted from functional data, as well as deeply buried sites that are not usually considered. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that occupation of both superficial and deeply buried sites most effectively preserves the experimental structure; the structure collapses in the absence of bound cholesterol. In particular, we find that bound cholesterol directly supports contacts between the agonist-binding domain and the pore that are thought to be essential for activation of the receptor. These results likely apply to those other ion channels within the Cys-loop superfamily that depend on cholesterol, such as the GABA receptor.},

abstract = {We present an elastic Hamiltonian for membrane energetics that captures bilayer undulation and peristaltic deformations over all wavelengths, including the short wavelength protrusion regime. The model implies continuous functional forms for thermal undulation and peristaltic amplitudes as a function of wavelength and predicts previously overlooked relationships between these curves. Undulation and peristaltic spectra display excellent agreement with data from both atomistic and coarse-grained models over all simulated length scales. Additionally, the model accurately predicts the bilayer's response to a cylindrical protein inclusion as observed in coarse-grained simulation. This elastic response provides an explanation for gramicidin ion channel lifetime versus membrane thickness data that requires no fit constants. The physical parameters inherent to this picture may be expressed in terms of familiar material properties associated with lipid monolayers. Inclusion of a finite monolayer spontaneous curvature is essential to obtain fully consistent agreement between theory and the full range of available simulation/experimental data.},

Regulators of lipid metabolism (for example, statins) are a highly successful class of marketed drugs, and exploration of lipid dysregulation in AD and identification of novel therapeutic agents acting through relevant lipid pathways offers new and effective options for the treatment of this devastating disorder.},

abstract = {Propofol, a widely used intravenous general anesthetic, acts at anesthetic concentrations as a positive allosteric modulator of $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid type A receptors and at higher concentration as an inhibitor of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Here, we characterize propofol binding sites in a muscle-type nAChR by use of a photoreactive analog of propofol, 2-isopropyl-5-[3-(trifluoromethyl)-3H-diazirin-3-yl]phenol (AziPm). Based upon radioligand binding assays, AziPm stabilized the Torpedo nAChR in the resting state, whereas propofol stabilized the desensitized state. nAChR-rich membranes were photolabeled with [(3)H]AziPm, and labeled amino acids were identified by Edman degradation. [(3)H]AziPm binds at three sites within the nAChR transmembrane domain: (i) an intrasubunit site in the $\delta$ subunit helix bundle, photolabeling in the nAChR desensitized state (+agonist) $\delta$M2-18' and two residues in $\delta$M1 ($\delta$Phe-232 and $\delta$Cys-236); (ii) in the ion channel, photolabeling in the nAChR resting, closed channel state (-agonist) amino acids in the M2 helices ($\alpha$M2-6', $\beta$M2-6' and -13', and $\delta$M2-13') that line the channel lumen (with photolabeling reduced by {\textgreater}90{\%} in the desensitized state); and (iii) at the $\gamma$-$\alpha$ interface, photolabeling $\alpha$M2-10'. Propofol enhanced [(3)H]AziPm photolabeling at $\alpha$M2-10'. Propofol inhibited [(3)H]AziPm photolabeling within the $\delta$ subunit helix bundle at lower concentrations (IC50 = 40 $\mu$m) than it inhibited ion channel photolabeling (IC50 = 125 $\mu$m). These results identify for the first time a single intrasubunit propofol binding site in the nAChR transmembrane domain and suggest that this is the functionally relevant inhibitory binding site.},

abstract = {Modulation of the GABA type A receptor (GABAAR) function by cholesterol and other steroids is documented at the functional level, yet its structural basis is largely unknown. Current data on structurally related modulators suggest that cholesterol binds to subunit interfaces between transmembrane domains of the GABAAR. We construct homology models of a human GABAAR based on the structure of the glutamate-gated chloride channel GluCl of Caenorhabditis elegans. The models show the possibility of previously unreported disulfide bridges linking the M1 and M3 transmembrane helices in the $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ subunits. We discuss the biological relevance of such disulfide bridges. Using our models, we investigate cholesterol binding to intersubunit cavities of the GABAAR transmembrane domain. We find that very similar binding modes are predicted independently by three approaches: analogy with ivermectin in the GluCl crystal structure, automated docking by AutoDock, and spontaneous rebinding events in unbiased molecular dynamics simulations. Taken together, the models and atomistic simulations suggest a somewhat flexible binding mode, with several possible orientations. Finally, we explore the possibility that cholesterol promotes pore opening through a wedge mechanism. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {Liquid-crystalline phases of stacked lipid bilayers represent a pervasive motif in biomolecular assemblies. Here we report that, in addition to the usual smectic order, multicomponent multilayer membranes can exhibit columnar order arising from the coupling of two-dimensional intralayer phase separation and interlayer smectic ordering. This coupling propagates across hundreds of membrane lamellae, producing long-range alignment of phase-separated domains. Quantitative analysis of real-time dynamical experiments reveals that there is an interplay between intralayer domain growth and interlayer coupling, suggesting the existence of cooperative multilayer epitaxy. We postulate that such long-range epitaxy is solvent-assisted, and that it originates from the surface tension associated with differences in the network of hydrogen-bonded water molecules at the hydrated interfaces between the domains and the surrounding phase. Our findings might inspire the development of self-assembly-based strategies for the long-range alignment of functional lipid domains.},

In the present study, the effects of various concentrations of ethanol (1-250 mM) on the lipid composition after the first 6 days of Xenopus embryo development were investigated, using an in vitro fertilization technique. Lipid analysis revealed: (1) a decrease of the cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio mainly derived from a higher content of phospholipids; (2) an increase of phospholipid unsaturated fatty acids, especially C20:4 and C20:5, with ethanol concentration of 150-250 mM; (3) a decrease of lipid-bound sialic acid with ethanol concentrations of {\textgreater} or =5 mM. These results underline that sialoglycoconjugates are a more sensitive target of alcohol in comparison with other lipid components. The cultured embryo method certainly represents a useful model for investigation of the direct effects of ethanol on lipid metabolism, excluding maternal interference which can lead to misinterpretation of data.},

abstract = {The acetylcholine receptor (AChR)-containing electroplax membranes from Torpedo californica have a relatively high cholesterol content. Reconstitution studies suggest that this cholesterol may be important in preserving or modulating the function of the acetylcholine receptor-channel complex. We have manipulated cholesterol levels in intact Torpedo AChR-rich membrane fragments using small, unilamellar phosphatidylcholine liposomes. Conditions have been established that allow further subfractionation of sucrose gradient purified Torpedo electroplax membranes into AChR-rich and ATPase-rich populations and that, at the same time, achieve cholesterol depletion without phospholipid back exchange or fusion. The incubation of membranes with excess liposomes could only achieve about a 50{\%} reduction in the molar ratio of cholesterol to phospholipid. In no case was the number of cholesterol molecules per AChR oligomer reduced below 36. The remaining cholesterol could not be depleted either by longer incubations or by multiple, sequential depletions. Cholesterol depletion was accompanied by a significant increase in bulk membrane fluidity as measured by electron spin resonance spectroscopy, but the equilibrium binding parameters of acetylcholine to its receptor were unaltered. This suggests strongly that there exist two pools of cholesterol in the AChR-rich Torpedo electroplax membrane: an easily depleted fraction that influences bulk fluidity, and a tightly-bound fraction perhaps surrounding the AChR oligomer. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

abstract = {Disorders of muscle lipid metabolism may involve intramyocellular triglyceride degradation, carnitine uptake, long-chain fatty acids mitochondrial transport, or fatty acid $\beta$-oxidation. Three main diseases leading to permanent muscle weakness are associated with severe increased muscle lipid content (lipid storage myopathies): primary carnitine deficiency, neutral lipid storage disease and multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. A moderate lipidosis may be observed in fatty acid oxidation disorders revealed by rhabdomyolysis episodes such as carnitine palmitoyl transferase II, very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiencies, and in recently described phosphatidic acid phosphatase deficiency. Respiratory chain disorders and congenital myasthenic syndromes may also be misdiagnosed as fatty acid oxidation disorders due to the presence of secondary muscle lipidosis. The main biochemical tests giving clues for the diagnosis of these various disorders are measurements of blood carnitine and acylcarnitines, urinary organic acid profile, and search for intracytoplasmic lipid on peripheral blood smear (Jordan's anomaly). Genetic analysis orientated by the results of biochemical investigation allows establishing a firm diagnosis. Primary carnitine deficiency and multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency may be treated after supplementation with carnitine, riboflavine and coenzyme Q10. New therapeutic approaches for fatty acid oxidation disorders are currently developed, based on pharmacological treatment with bezafibrate, and specific diets enriched in medium-chain triglycerides or triheptanoin. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Lipid rafts are subdomains of the plasma membrane that contain high concentrations of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids. They exist as distinct liquid-ordered regions of the membrane that are resistant to extraction with nonionic detergents. Rafts appear to be small in size, but may constitute a relatively large fraction of the plasma membrane. While rafts have a distinctive protein and lipid composition, all rafts do not appear to be identical in terms of either the proteins or the lipids that they contain. A variety of proteins, especially those involved in cell signaling, have been shown to partition into lipid rafts. As a result, lipid rafts are thought to be involved in the regulation of signal transduction. Experimental evidence suggests that there are probably several different mechanisms through which rafts control cell signaling. For example, rafts may contain incomplete signaling pathways that are activated when a receptor or other required molecule is recruited into the raft. Rafts may also be important in limiting signaling, either by physical sequestration of signaling components to block nonspecific interactions, or by suppressing the intrinsic activity of signaling proteins present within rafts.This review provides an overview of the physical characteristics of lipid rafts and summarizes studies that have helped to elucidate the role of lipid rafts in signaling via receptor tyrosine kinases and G protein-coupled receptors.},

These findings have been attributed to the ability of nicotine to act as a neuroprotective agent. A large number of studies demonstrate that nicotine can protect against neuronal death in vitro and in vivo, and the mechanisms underlying the ability of nicotine to protect against excitotoxicity and amyloid-? toxicity are beginning to be elucidated. Despite the compelling evidence that nicotine is neuroprotective, it is clear that nicotine can be toxic under some circumstances. The balance between nicotine neuroprotection and toxicity depends on dose, developmental stage and regimen of administration. Therefore, a full understanding of the molecular and cellular effects of nicotine on signaling pathways relevant to neuronal survival is critical for informed drug discovery of nicotinic compounds to combat human neurodegeneration. This review summarizes recent studies related to the mechanisms underlying nicotine-mediated neuroprotection, and addresses issues that are relevant to use of nicotine as a neuroprotective agent in vivo.},

Evidence supporting this hypothesis for schizophrenia includes abnormal brain phospholipid turnover shown by 31P Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, increased levels of phospholipase A2, reduced niacin skin flush response, abnormal electroretinogram, and reduced cell membrane levels of n-3 and n-6 PUFA. In depression, there is strong epidemiological evidence that fish consumption reduces risk of becoming depressed and evidence that cell membrane levels of n-3 PUFA are reduced. Four out of five placebo-controlled double- blind trials of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in the treatment of schizophrenia have given positive findings. In depression, two placebo-controlled trials have shown a strong therapeutic effect of ethyl-EPA added to existing medication. The mode of action of EPA is currently not known, but recent evidence suggests that arachidonic acid (AA) if of particular importance in schizophrenia and that clinical improvement in schizophrenic patients using EPA treatment correlates with changes in AA. {\textcopyright} 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Agrin, a motoneuron-derived factor, and the muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK) are essential for the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering at the postjunctional membrane. However, the underlying signaling mechanisms remain poorly defined. We show that agrin stimulates a dynamic translocation of the AChR into lipid rafts-cholesterol and sphingolipid-rich microdomains in the plasma membrane. This follows MuSK partition into lipid rafts and requires its activation. Disruption of lipid rafts inhibits MuSK activation and downstream signaling and AChR clustering in response to agrin. Rapsyn, an intracellular protein necessary for AChR clustering, is located constitutively in lipid rafts, but its interaction with the AChR is inhibited when lipid rafts are perturbed. These results reveal that lipid rafts may regulate AChR clustering by facilitating the agrin/MuSK signaling and the interaction between the receptor and rapsyn, both necessary for AChR clustering and maintenance. These results provide insight into mechanisms of AChR cluster formation.},

abstract = {PUFA deficiencies in cellular membranes have been observed in ultra-high risk (HR) individuals and in early schizophrenia. It is uncertain whether dietary PUFA consumption can be associated with the risk of transition to psychosis in HR individuals. The aim of the study was to assess PUFA consumption and confirm whether dietary habits are related to the risk of transition to full-threshold psychosis in HR individuals during a 12-month follow-up. PUFA consumption during the previous year was analyzed in 62 h individuals and 33 healthy controls (HC) at the beginning of the follow-up period using a validated Food-Frequency Questionnaire and the Polish Food Composition Tables. Fifteen HR individuals converted into psychosis (C-HR) during the 12-month follow-up. C-HR individuals reported significantly higher consumption of n-6 fatty acids (linoleic acid, LA and arachidonic acid, AA) in comparison with individuals who did not develop psychosis (NC-HR). The C-HR group reported a significantly higher AA/(EPA+DHA) consumption ratio than the NC-HR group. HC reported significantly higher consumption of most n-3 PUFA and lower consumption of all n-6 PUFA than both groups of HR individuals. The results suggest that dietary patterns of PUFA consumption may play a role in the conversion to psychosis of HR individuals.},

abstract = {The maintenance of optimal cognitive function is a central feature of healthy aging. Impairment in brain glucose uptake is common in aging associated cognitive deterioration, but little is known of how this problem arises or whether it can be corrected or bypassed. Several aspects of the challenge to providing the brain with an adequate supply of fuel during aging seem to relate to omega-3 fatty acids. For instance, low intake of omega-3 fatty acids, especially docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is becoming increasingly associated with several forms of cognitive decline in the elderly, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Brain DHA level seems to be an important regulator of brain glucose uptake, possibly by affecting the activity of some but not all the glucose transporters. DHA synthesis from either $\alpha$-linolenic acid (ALA) or eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is very low in humans begging the question of whether these DHA precursors are likely to be helpful in maintaining cognition during aging. We speculate that ALA and EPA may well have useful supporting roles in maintaining brain function during aging but not by their conversion to DHA. ALA is an efficient ketogenic fatty acid, while EPA promotes fatty acid oxidation. By helping to produce ketone bodies, the effects of ALA and EPA could well be useful in strategies intended to use ketones to bypass problems of impaired glucose access to the brain during aging. Hence, it may be time to consider whether the main omega-3 fatty acids have distinct but complementary roles in brain function. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Zebrafish (Danio rerio) have been used to study multiple effects of nicotine, for example on cognition, locomotion, and stress responses, relying on the assumption that pharmacological tools will operate similarly upon molecular substrates in the fish and mammalian systems. We have cloned the zebrafish nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits and expressed key nAChR subtypes in Xenopus oocytes including neuronal ($\alpha$4$\beta$2, $\alpha$2$\beta$2, $\alpha$3$\beta$4, and $\alpha$7) and muscle ($\alpha$1$\beta$1 b$\epsilon$$\delta$) nAChR. Consistent with studies of mammalian nAChR, nicotine was relatively inactive on muscle-type receptors, having both low potency and efficacy. It had high efficacy but low potency for $\alpha$7 receptors, and the best potency and good efficacy for $\alpha$4$\beta$2 receptors. Cytisine, a key lead compound for the development of smoking cessation agents, is a full agonist for both mammalian $\alpha$7 and $\alpha$3$\beta$4 receptors, but a full agonist only for the fish $\alpha$7, with surprisingly low efficacy for $\alpha$3$\beta$4. The efficacy of cytisine for $\alpha$4$\beta$2 was somewhat greater than typically reported for mammalian $\alpha$4$\beta$2. The ganglionic blocker mecamylamine was most potent for blocking $\alpha$3$\beta$4 receptors, least potent for $\alpha$7, and roughly equipotent for the muscle receptors and the $\beta$2-containing nAChR. However, the block of $\beta$2-containing receptors was slowly reversible, consistent with effective targeting of these CNS-type receptors in vivo. Three prototypical $\alpha$7-selective agonists, choline, tropane, and 4OH-GTS-21, were tested, and these agents were observed to activate both fish $\alpha$7 and $\alpha$4$\beta$2 nAChR. Our data therefore indicate that while some pharmacological tools used in zebrafish may function as expected, others will not. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We find that the membrane thickness, which is perturbed from its equilibrium value by the coupling to the embedded inclusions, decays non-monotonically with distance from the inclusion boundary. As a result, the membrane-induced interactions between inclusions vary non monotonically with spacing. The periodicity of the perturbation profile, as well as the strength and range of the induced interactions, are proportional to the ratio of the amphiphile bending modulus and compressibility. In systems where the inclusions impose a thickness-matching constraint, the induced interactions are attractive. However, the presence of an energy barrier at a finite spacing may hinder aggregation. In systems where the inclusions impose a specific contact-angle, the interaction energy is minimal at a finite inclusion spacing.},

The membranes contained cholesterol (0.158 mg per mg protein), phospholipids (0.714 mg per mg protein) and gangliosides (0.125 mg per mg protein) as major constituents while cerebrosides and sulphatides were present in only trace amounts. Analysis of the gangliosides by thin-layer chromatography showed that there was no selective enrichment of any individual type in the plasma membranes in relation to total brain. The major phospholipids were ethanolamine (34.2 {\%}), choline (41.6 {\%}) and serine (13.2 {\%}) phosphoglycerides. Inositol monophospho-glyceride (3.5 {\%}), sphingomyelin (5.1 {\%}) and lysolecithin (1.0 {\%}) were relatively minor components while phosphatidylglycerol was not present. Each phospholipid class showed a specific fatty acid composition which differed from that of the other phospholipids. This result extends the specific fatty acid compositions observed in grey matter and certain sub-fractions by other workers. In particular, choline phos-phoglycerides contained high levels of saturated fatty acids while large quantities of docosahexaenoic acid were present in ethanolamine and serine phosphoglycerides.},

abstract = {This study compares the lipid composition, including individual phospholipid molecular species of solubilized nAChR detergent complexes (nAChR-DCs) with those of the bulk lipids from their source, Torpedo californica (Tc) electric tissue. This lipidomic analysis revealed seventy-seven (77) phospholipid species in the Tc tissue. Analysis of affinity-purified nAChR-DCs prepared with C-12 to C-16 phospholipid analog detergents alkylphosphocholine (FC) and lysofoscholine (LFC) demonstrated that nAChR-DCs prepared with FC12, LFC14, and LFC16 contained {\textgreater}60 phospholipids/nAChR, which was more than twice of those prepared with FC14, FC16, and LFC12. Significantly, all the nAChR-DCs lacked ethanolamine and anionic phospholipids, contained only four cholesterol molecules, and a limited number of phospholipid molecular species per nAChR. Upon incorporation into oocytes, FC12 produce significant functionality, whereas LFC14 and LFC16 nAChR-DCs displayed an increased functionality as compared to the crude Tc membrane. All three nAChR-DCs displayed different degrees of alterations in macroscopic activation and desensitization kinetics. The manner by which detergents affect lipid composition, functionality and stability of solubilized membrane proteins is a poorly understood aspect of the structural biology of membrane proteins. The nicotinic acetylcho-line receptor (nAChR) is a model transmembrane protein that has been widely used for the study of lipid-protein interactions.

For one model mixture in particular, DPPC/DOPC/Chol, we have mapped phase boundaries for the full ternary system. For this mixture we observe two coexisting liquid phases over a wide range of lipid composition and temperature, with one phase rich in the unsaturated lipid and the other rich in the saturated lipid and cholesterol. We find a simple relationship between chain melting temperature and miscibility transition temperature that holds for both phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin lipids. We experimentally cross miscibility boundaries both by changing temperature and by the depletion of cholesterol with beta-cyclodextrin. Liquid domains in vesicles exhibit interesting behavior: they collide and coalesce, can finger into stripes, and can bulge out of the vesicle. To date, we have not observed macroscopic separation of liquid phases in only binary lipid mixtures.},

At non-vanishing lateral tensions, the interaction is found to depend on the orientation of the cones with respect to the membrane plane. The interaction of inclusions of equal orientation is repulsive at all distances between them, while the inclusions of opposite orientation repel each other at small separations, but attract each other at larger ones. Both the repulsive and attractive forces become stronger with increasing lateral tension. This is different from what has been predicted on the basis of the same static model for the case of vanishing lateral tension. Without tension, the inclusions repel each other at all distances independently of their relative orientation. We conclude that lateral tension may induce the aggregation of conical membrane inclusions.},

abstract = {The lipid composition of plasma membranes and tonoplasts from etiolated mung bean hypocotyls was examined in detail. Phospholipids, sterols, and ceramide monohexoside(s) were the major lipid classes in both membranes. The content of phospholipids on a protein basis was higher in the tonoplast, but the content of total sterols was similar in both membranes. Accordingly, the sterol to phospholipid molar ratio in the plasma membrane was higher than that of the tonoplast. Phosphati-dylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine comprised the major phospho-lipids in both membranes. Phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylglycerol were identified as minor phospholipid components. The content of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylglycerol was rela-tively high in the tonoplast, comprising 11 and 5{\%} of the total phospho-lipids, respectively. Although special care was taken against the degra-dative action of phospholipase D and phosphatidic acid phosphatase during the isolation of these membranes, by adding EDTA, EGTA, KF, choline, and ethanolamine to the homogenizing medium, significant amounts of phosphatidic acid, about 15{\%} of the total phospholipids, were detected in the plasma membrane. On the other hand, the content of phosphatidic acid in tonoplasts and other membrane fractions was very low. This fact may indicate that high levels of phosphatidic acid occur naturally in plasma membranes. Phosphatidylglycerol in both membranes and phosphatidylinositol in the tonoplast contained high levels of palmitic acid, which comprised more than 50{\%} of the total fatty acids. Significant differences were observed in the sterol compositions of plasma mem-branes and tonoplasts. More than 90{\%} of the sterols in the plasma membrane were unesterified, while the tonoplast was enriched in glyco-sylated sterols, especially acylated sterylglycosides. Ceramide mono-hexoside was found to be specifically located in these membranes, in particular, in the tonoplast, in which it comprised nearly 17{\%} of the total lipids. Lipids are recognized as major chemical components of bio-membranes and play an important role in cellular activities through control of permeability, fluidity, and membrane-bound},

abstract = {The aim of the study was to investigate the replacement of fish oil by vegetable oils and the effects of a washout with a return to fish oil on growth performances and lipid metabolism. Three experimental fish meal-based isonitrogenous (crude protein content: 57.5{\%}) and isolipidic (crude lipid content: 16.5{\%}) diets were formulated containing either 9{\%} of added fish oil (FO), soybean oil (SO), or linseed oil (LO). Each diet was distributed to triplicate groups of 25 marketable size turbot (initial body weight of 579 g) grown in seawater at water temperature of 17°C. Fish were fed once a day to visual satiety. At the end of the growth trial, which lasted 13 weeks, all groups of turbot were fed with FO diet for 8 weeks. The growth of turbot was high, but the incorporation of vegetable oils in the diets resulted in a slight decrease in growth as compared to those fed with fish oil-based diet. Feed and protein efficiency and whole body composition were not affected by dietary lipid sources. Total lipid content was low in the muscle of turbot (below 2{\%}); ventral muscle being fatter than dorsal muscle. Liver and muscle fatty acid (FA) composition reflected dietary FA composition. Liver and muscle of fish fed with SO diet were rich in 18:2n-6, whereas those of fish fed with LO diet were rich in 18:3n-3. Liver and muscle of fish fed with SO and LO diets had lower levels of 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 in comparison to those of fish fed with FO diet. In turbot, hepatic lipogenic enzyme activities were low and not influenced by dietary lipid source. At the end of the second period, after transfer to FO-based diets, muscle FA composition of fish fed previously with SO and LO diets were still different to those of fish fed with FO diet. The values of 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3, respectively, were lower than the values found at the end of the growth period, but higher than those of fish fed with FO diet. An increase of FA levels, characteristic of fish oil, was observed in the liver and muscle of fish previously fed with vegetable oils. Data obtained show that replacement of fish oil by vegetable oils is possible with negligible impact on growth performance of turbot, that dietary lipids are an effective vector to influence the nutritional quality of finished product, and that a duration of 8 weeks is not sufficient to bring the FA profile of turbot of this size back to that of fish fed with fish oil over the whole period. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

@article{Olsen2003,
abstract = {Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum) were fed purified diets containing fish oil for six weeks and then soybean lecithin or soybean oil for 25 days. The gastrointestinal tract segments, stomach, midgut and hindgut were then sampled for lipid and fatty acid composition and electron microscopy. Membrane lipid class composition was fairly similar in all three segments of trout fed fish oil. Hindgut contained slightly more phosphatidylserine than stomach and midgut, while midgut contained more phosphatidylcholine and less lysophos-patidylcholine/sphingomyelin. Feeding soybean products appeared to marginally decrease free cholesterol. The fatty acid compositions of the main lipid classes showed significant regional differences. In control fish, stomach had higher levels of arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids than midgut and hindgut, and lower content of docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Midgut phosphatidyleth-anolamine also had higher levels of saturated fatty acids and less n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids than the other tissues. Feeding soybean products decreased the n-3/n-6 ratio mainly due to increases in linoleic (18:2n-6) and 20:4n-6 and decreases in 22:6n-3 and eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3). Phosphatidylcholine and to a lesser extent phosphatidylethanolamine adapted more readily to dietary changes by major increases in 18:2n-6 and C 20−22 n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids. The composition of phosphatidyl-serine and -inositol appeared to be under more strict metabolic control. Linoleic acid hardly increased at all while the increase in other n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids was less pronounced than for the other lipid classes. Regardless of lipid class, stomach resisted dietary changes more strongly than midgut and hindgut. Increases in n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids were minor as were the loss of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. The dead-end product 20:2n-6 accumulated to a higher degree in hindgut phosphatidyl-ethanolamine and -coline compared to midgut and stomach, suggesting that the activity of 6 desaturation is higher in the anterior part of the intestine where most of the lipid is absorbed. Feeding soybean oil caused massive accumulation of free lipid droplets in midgut enterocytes while little lipid droplets were observed in trout fed fish oil or soybean lecithin. Since both soybean products influenced intestinal composition to the same degree, altered fatty acid profiles in membranes is not responsible for the observed lipid accumulation. This supports previous observations in Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus L.), suggesting that fish may require exogenous phospholipids in order to sustain a sufficient rate of lipoprotein synthesis.},

abstract = {Liquid domains in model lipid bilayers are frequently studied as models of raft domains in cell plasma membranes. Micron-scale liquid domains are easily produced in vesicles composed of ternary mixtures of a high melting temperature lipid, a low melting temperature lipid, and cholesterol. Here, we describe the rich phase behavior observed in binary and ternary systems. We then discuss experimental challenges inherent in mapping phase diagrams of even simple lipid systems. For example, miscibility behavior varies with lipid type, lipid ratio, lipid oxidation, and level of impurity. Liquid domains are often circular, but can become noncircular when membranes are near critical points. Finally, we reflect on applications of phase diagrams in model systems to rafts in cell membranes. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
